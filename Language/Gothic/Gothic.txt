Gothic Online
Series Introduction
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum

Gothic is the language of the earliest literary documents of the Germanic peoples as a whole. The only linguistic remnants of Germanic peoples which antedate Gothic remains are some of the Runic inscriptions, with which the Gothic language shares not a few characteristics because of its general linguistic conservatism. The language itself belongs to what is termed the East Germanic branch of languages, and is in fact the sole documented survivor of the branch. Other languages presumed to have belonged to this group, such as Vandalic, have left no written records. The primary source of linguistic data for the Gothic language is what remains of a translation of the Bible made sometime in the 4th century AD. Aside from a few other remains, however, this period furnishes the only remains of the Gothic language. Gothic may have survived near the Black Sea, though in altered form, until at least the 16th century as a nonliterary language now termed Crimean Gothic.

1. Location of the Goths
Precise location of the Gothic homeland is difficult for two principal reasons:

the Goths left no clear written or archaeological records which may be used to pinpoint their location;
they seem not to have remained in one region for any lengthy period of time, being driven to migration by stimuli both internal and external.
From later sources, the general consensus is that the earliest known location of the Goths was somewhere in the reaches of northern or northeastern Europe. This may have included parts of Scandinavia, as well as the northern reaches of modern Poland. The Goths appear to have subsequently migrated to the regions bordering the Black Sea to the north, and to the east of the Danube river, which formed the border of the Roman empire.

From this region, the Goths ventured out in the mid-3rd century AD on a series of raids which marked the beginning of a centuries' long struggle between the Gothic peoples and the Roman empire. The Goths crossed the Danube into Roman territory in 376 AD.

At no point in their mention in the history books do the Goths seem to have been a completely unified people. In the period of their earliest raids, they seem to have been broken into several factions. By the time they became an overarching threat to the empire, they seem to have coalesced into two main groups, eventually termed the Visigoths and Ostrogoths.

Though the term Visigoth may have originated in an embellished rendering of an earlier appellation, Vesi, it soon came to connote 'west'; its counterpart Ostrogoth seems always to have connoted 'east', both terms agreeing with the relative locations of the tribes. The latter tribe eventually fought alongside the Huns as they ravaged Europe. The former eventually pushed its way through Italy and seized Rome itself. Their subsequent migrations and settlements have left linguistic remnants in regional names throughout Europe.

2. Position of Gothic in the Germanic Family
2.1 Characteristic Features of Gothic
The Gothic language has several characteristics which distinguish it from other languages of the Germanic family. The most salient of these are discussed in the following two sections.

2.1.1 Phonological Characteristics
The Proto-Germanic vowel *e1, probably pronounced [ǣ], became Gothic ē, though other Germanic languages have ā or ō. Compare the following forms:

Gothic Sound
Change	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*e1 > ē	 	qēmun	 	kāmun	 	cwōmon	 	kvāmu	 	'they came'
 	 	mēna	 	māno	 	mōna	 	māne	 	'moon'
Though Gothic follows Greek orthographic practice in using a doubled-g to write the sound of Modern English ng in sing, i.e. gg = [ŋg], there are some instances of a true double consonant gg [gg]. These are always found before -w- and are reflexes of a general sound development in Gothic called Verschaerfung, or Sharpening. According to this rule, Proto-Germanic *ww became Gothic ggw; a similar development changed Proto-Germanic *jj to Gothic ddj. This sharpening is a feature Gothic shares with Old Norse. Compare the examples in the following table:

Gothic Sound
Change	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ww > ggw	 	triggws	 	triuwi	 	trīewe	 	tryggr	 	'true, faithful'
 	 	glaggwus	 	glau	 	glēaw	 	gluggr	 	'accurate; wise'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*jj > ggj	 	twaddjē	 	zwei(i)o	 	twēg(e)a	 	tveggja	 	'of two'
 	 	-waddjus	 	 	 	 	 	veggr	 	'wall'
Gothic alone does not show the effects of rhotacism which other Germanic languages display. Through this change, Proto-Germanic *z became r in most of the Germanic daughter languages (this *z sometimes appears as s in Gothic). The terminology derives from the Greek name for the equivalent of the letter r, i.e. rho. Consider the following examples:

Gothic Sound
Change	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*z > z	 	láisjan	 	lēren	 	lǣran	 	 	 	'teach'
 	 	huzd	 	hort	 	hord	 	hodd	 	'hoard'
 	 	wēsun	 	wārun	 	wǣron	 	váru	 	'they were'
Gothic displays the change of initial Proto-Germanic *fl- to þl-, which does not occur in other Germanic languages. But this seems only to have occured in the environment of -h, -hs, or *-kw. Consider the table below:

Gothic Sound
Change	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*fl- > þl-	 	þliuhan	 	fliohan	 	flēon	 	flýja	 	'flee'
 	 	*þlahsjan	 	 	 	flīeman	 	flæma	 	'frighten, drive, chase'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*fl- > fl-	 	flōdus	 	flōt	 	flōd	 	flōð	 	'flood'
 	 	flōkan	 	fluohhōn	 	flōcan	 	flōkinn (ptcple.)	 	'bewail, strike, curse, distress'
Gothic did not undergo the i-umlaut and u-umlaut found in several other Germanic languages. Through this change, an i or j contained in one syllable would serve to front the vowel of the immediately preceding syllable, leaving its roundness unaffected; analogously an u or w in a given syllable would serve to round the vowel in the immediately preceding syllable, leaving frontness or backness unaffected. Consider the following examples:

PGmc	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*gastiz	 	gasts	 	gast	 	giest	 	gestr	 	'stranger, guest'
*nasjan	 	nasjan	 	nerren	 	nerian	 	 	 	'save'
*handus	 	handus	 	hant	 	hond	 	hǫnd	 	'hand'
2.1.2 Morphological Characteristics
Gothic has retained the original nominative singular masculine ending of a-stem nouns, PGmc *-az, more or less intact as final -s:

PGmc	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dagaz	 	dags	 	tac	 	dæg	 	dagr	 	'day'
*gastiz	 	gasts	 	gast	 	giest	 	gestr	 	'stranger, guest'
Gothic likewise retains the Proto-Indo-European accusative plural ending *-ns, which elsewhere in Germanic loses the nasal, and sometimes the sibilant as well:

PGmc	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dagans	 	dagans	 	taga	 	dagas	 	daga	 	'days' (acc. pl.)
Gothic is unique among the Germanic languages in retaining a functioning morphological passive. Compare Gothic baírada 'is borne' to Greek phéretai and Sanskrit bhárate. This passive conjugation is only found in the present tense. The only remnants of such forms in other Germanic languages are possibly Runic haite, Old Norse heiti, Old English hātte 'I am called'.

Gothic is also unique in preserving a full class of reduplicating verbs, the seventh class of strong verbs. Strong verbs across the Germanic languages generally use vocalic alternation to signal a change in tense, but Gothic possesses in addition a fairly large number of verbs that reduplicate the root syllable to mark the past tense. Thus the 3rd person singular preterite indicative of háitan 'call (by name)' is haíháit. Compare Greek dé-dōka and Latin de-dī 'I have given'. Remnants of such a system survive in other Germanic languages, but the instances are few and far between: Old English hēt '(he) called' < he-ht, reduplicated preterite of hātan 'name'. Generally such verbs have shifted to a different strong verb class in the other Germanic languages, e.g. Old High German 3rd singular preterite hiaz from eizan 'be called'.

Gothic displays the ending -t in the second person singular preterite indicative of strong verbs. This feature is also found in Old Norse, but generally lost elsewhere in Germanic. In preterite-present verbs, however, the form survives across the Germanic languages. Compare the following examples of cognate strong verbs and cognate preterite-present verbs:

Verb Type	 	Gothic	 	Old High
German	 	Old
English	 	Old
Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	namt	 	nāmi	 	nōme	 	namt	 	'thou didst take'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Preterite-Pres.	 	þarft	 	darft	 	þearft	 	þarft	 	'thou needest'
Gothic is the only language of the Germanic family to employ a polysyllabic dental suffix in forming the preterite of weak verbs. For example, where Old English has neredon 'we saved', Gothic has nasidēdum 'we saved'. While there is a single dental in the Old English suffix, Gothic shows the sequence -dēd- in plural forms.

2.2 Gothic and the Germanic Family Tree
The Germanic family tree is traditionally divided into three branches: North, West, and East Germanic. Of North Germanic, Old Norse is the primary exemplar; of West Germanic, Old English and Old High German are exemplars; of East Germanic, Gothic is the sole remnant. The three branches are not, however, as distinct as the terminology might first suggest. Gothic shares separate features with various languages in each of the other two branches.

Gothic shows several features in common with North Germanic (some of which have been discussed above), including the following:

sharpening of *ww and *jj;
the sound change *ngw > ng;
a number of verbs of the -nan class;
a 2nd person singular preterite ending -t;
the lack of short forms, i.e. non-infixed forms, for 'stand' and 'go';
the lack of a gerund.
Gothic and Old Norse also share a feminine participle formation in -īn, rather than the -jō formation found in West Germanic. For these reasons, and others, some scholars have argued that Gothic and Old Norse early formed a single branch of Germanic, which subsequently divided. This has the added benefit of geographical support. In particular, ancient sources describing the earliest locations of the Goths place them in the vicinity of Scandinavia. Such a location at an early date would surely have led to a period of common development.

There are, however, counterarguments to the close association of Gothic and North Germanic. Among these counterarguments is the fact that sharpening is the only clear common innovation within Gothic and Old Norse. All of the other commonalities can potentially be explained as facets of Proto-Germanic which all the Germanic languages would have shared, but which subsequently only Gothic and Old Norse retained. All other Germanic languages simply lost those features. What is more, the form of sharpening in the two languages differs: NGmc *jj > Gothic ddj, but Old Norse ggj. And it is not altogether clear that North Germanic had no short forms for the verbs 'stand' and 'go'. The earliest texts of Old Swedish do in fact show short forms stā 'stand' and gā 'go'.

To add to the mystery of how East Germanic is related to the other branches of the family, there is the fact that Gothic shares some common features with Old High German, in the West Germanic branch, to the exclusion of Old Norse. These include:

third person pronoun, masculine nominative singular stem in i-, rather than h-: Gothic is and Old High German er as against Old Norse hinn, Old English hē, Old Saxon hē;
third person singular present indicative form of 'to be' with final -t: Gothic ist and Old High German ist as against Old Norse er, Old English is, Old Saxon is, ist.
Such features suggest the possibility of close interaction between Goths and Germans of the southeastern regions. If these features can be dated to an early period, as some scholars argue, then this casts some doubts on a protracted period of common development between Gothic and Old Norse, and even on the grouping of the West Germanic dialects itself.

3. The Gothic Corpus
The corpus of the Gothic language consists chiefly of large portions of a translation of the New Testament Gospels and Epistles; the only surviving remnants of the Old Testament are chapters 5-7 of Nehemiah. This translation is generally ascribed to the bishop Wulfila in the middle of the 4th century AD, though there is no direct evidence that the translation that survives is actually in his words; the major manuscripts themselves all date from the late 5th to middle 6th century. What remain are references to the fact that Wulfila did in fact translate the Bible in its entirety, save for the Book of Kings. There are, however, no other references to a biblical translator among the Goths, so that the association of the surviving text with Wulfila is not likely to be far off the mark.

The Gothic biblical translation is apparently based on the Antiochene-Byzantine recension of Lucian the Martyr (c. 312), which was a Greek text dominant in the diocese of Constantinople. This exact version of the biblical writings does not survive, though some scholars have attempted to delimit the places in which it differs from the Greek manuscripts on which the modern received text is based. There are also apparent traces of influence from Latin translations of the Bible from the pre-Vulgate era.

Of the codices that contain the Gothic translation of the Bible, the Codex Argenteus, or Silver Codex, is by far the most impressive. The name comes from the binding, which is made of silver. Within this are contained 187 leaves out of a presumed original 336. The pages are purple parchment, though now a faded red, with letters of silver and gold. The beginnings of gospels, the first lines of sections and the Lord's Prayer, and the gospel symbols at the bottom of the pages are all in gold letters; the rest is written in silver. The codex was discovered in the abbey at Werden in the 16th century. It was subsequently taken to Prague; when the city fell to the Swedes in 1648, the codex was taken to Stockholm. After being transferred to Holland and then purchased again by the Swedish chancellor de la Gardie, it now resides in the library of the University of Uppsala. Another leaf was discovered in 1970 in the cathedral of Speyer on the Rhine.

The Codex Gissensis was found in Egypt in 1907. This consisted of four pages containing verses from Luke 23-24 in Latin and Gothic. It was subsequently ruined by water damage.

The Codex Carolinus is a palimpsest consisting of 4 leaves and containing verses from the Epistle to the Romans in both Latin and Gothic. It was found in the abbey of Weissenburg, though it originally belonged to the monastery at Bobbio in Liguria. It now resides in the Wolfenbuettel library.

The Codices Ambrosiani are likewise palimpsests. There are five of these codices, labelled A-E. Codex A contains 102 leaves, of which 6 are blank and another illegible. This contains various segments of the Epistles, as well as one page of a calendar. Codex B contains 78 leaves, which have the complete text of II Corinthians as well as parts of other Epistles. Codex C has two leaves, containing Matthew 25-27. Codex D contains 3 leaves, showing part of the book of Nehemiah.

The last of the Codices Ambrosiani, Codex E, contains eight leaves. In these survive a document, given the title Skeireins aíwaggēljons þaírh Iōhannēn 'Explanation of the Gospel according to John' by the editor Massmann in 1834, generally referred to simply as the Skeireins. The author of this commentary is not known; though possibly written by Wulfila, there is no evidence of this.

In addition there are very sparse remnants of other documents: a fragment of a calendar of martyrs, marginal notes in a Veronese manuscript, a Latin title deed from Ravenna written c. 551, and another Latin deed from Arezzo which has subsequently been lost. There are also examples of the letters of the Gothic alphabet written with their associated names. In addition, there are transcriptions of numerals in a Salzburg-Vienna manuscript of the 9th-10th centuries. A few phrases remain elsewhere in an almost phonetic Latin transcription.

One letter by the diplomat Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq is believed to contain the most recent traces of the Gothic language. It describes his encounter, sometime between 1555 and 1562, with two envoys from the Crimea who spoke a language presumed to be Gothic, or a closely related language. This letter was subsequently printed in Paris in 1589. The identification is not however air-tight, as the letter has only about 100 Gothic words, most of them grammatically isolated, and suffers from many problems of orthography and transmission.

Lesson 1
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Literary Origins of the Goths
The earliest literary references to the Goths are found in the works of Pliny, Strabo, and Tacitus. In his Natural History, Pliny the Elder mentions a certain Pytheas of Messalia, a Greek historian who records his observations on a journey through the 'parts near Ocean', sometime around the time of Alexander the Great. Pliny states that Pytheas believed a tribe called Gutones inhabited regions of Germania. Pliny's statement of Pytheas' findings concerning the Goths, however, presents scholars with two difficulties: (1) that the statement in question actually contains Guiones, which must be emended to Gutones to bring it in line with other presumed references to the Goths in Pliny; (2) the reference to Germania is clearly Pliny's own, since no such province was in existence in the time of Pytheas. Hence we cannot be sure what Pytheas himself said about their location. Pliny later mentions the Gutones as one of five tribes of the Germani.

Strabo, in his Geography, mentions the Gutones in a discussion of the Hercynian Forest. Once again, however, such an association rests on textual emendment: the manuscript reads Boutones, which scholars emend to Goutones. The location is not specified, which is not unexpected, since few authors could claim to know anything certain about regions beyond the Danube in this period.

Tacitus, in his work the Germania, written sometime around 98 AD, says in chapter 43: "beyond the Lugii, the Gotones are ruled by kings..., and next, close to the Ocean, the Rugii" and others. According to his account, the Suebi are in northern Europe, the Lugii beyond them, and the Gotones beyond them; but the latter must not quite be on the Baltic coast, since the Rugii and others are closer to the Baltic than the Gotones. Tacitus also mentions in his later work the Annales, chapters 2.62-63, that a certain Catualda was a noble among the Gotones.

In his Geography, Ptolemy locates the Guthones near the Vistula river. He elsewhere lists the Goutai as one of the seven tribes inhabiting Skandiai, presumably Sweden. It is not clear if both of these terms refer to the same tribe. If so, these are perhaps reflexes of strong and weak forms of the name. If not, one is not sure which ones are 'the' Goths. Some link the Goutai to the Geats of Beowulf, whose history thereafter is know from other medieval sources. But it is not clear that these are the Goths of Scandinavia.

The late 4th century, non-Christian author Ammianus Marcellinus is an important source for our understanding of the early movements of the Gothic tribes and their interaction with imperial forces. But he mentions nothing of Gothic origins, even though he mentions origins of others, such as the Alans, who descended from the Massagetae, and the Persians from the Scythians. Ammianus focuses on the movements of individual Gothic groups, most importantly the Tervingi and the Greuthungi.

Bishop Ambrose of Milan, in composing his work De Fide sometime around 380 AD for the emperor Gratian, links the Gothi with the Biblical Gog, ruler of the land Magog, which is perhaps set to the north, and maybe connected with islands. Ambrose seems to have taken the occasion to place Gratian's struggle with the Goths in a more divine setting, since in Revelations 20.7-10, Gog is destined to compass 'the camp of the saints'. The genealogist Josephus, earlier writing the Antiquitates in 93-94 AD, links Magogites with Scythians; Josephus is directly quoted by the later Gothic historian Jordanes.

Jerome, writing sometime c. 390, challenges the identification of the Goths with Gog and his people. He identifies Getae and Gothi. Orosius, writing the Historia adversum paganos in 417 AD and seeking to play down the prophetic overtones of a link between Goths and Gog, follows Jerome's association. The association was a simple one, since the Getae had lived along the lower Danube, and this was the origin of the Gothi in their attack on Rome. Augustine, however, writing De civitate Dei between 413 and 427 AD, denies the equation of Goths and Scythians, as well as that of Goths and Getae.

One of our most important sources of Gothic history is Jordanes, who wrote the Origins and Acts of the Goths or Getica in 550 AD in Constantinople. Though he wrote in Latin, Jordanes is unique among our sources because he is the only one who is himself a Goth. He states in his work that he relies on Gothic oral tradition, but nevertheless claims some personal acquaintance with the material he treats. He also mentions that he closely follows the written work of another historian, the Gothic History written by Cassiodorus, a Roman Senator in the 520s in the court of Theodoric the Great, the Ostrogothic king of Italy. He thrice mentions another historian, Ablabius, who perhaps wrote in the court of a Visigothic king.

The Getica gives an account of Gothic history from its inception, i.e. from the origin of the Gothic people to the time of writing, providing several concepts central to modern attempts to reconstruct Gothic history:

a. the Goths were originally in Scandinavia (more specifically, an island in or near Scandinavia), subsequently crossed the Baltic, migrated through Poland, and settled near the Black Sea;
b. by the time of the 3rd century, the Goths were divided into two groups: Visigoths and Ostrogoths;
c. the two groups of Goths were each led by royal families, the Balthi and the Amals.
Under the assumption that there are no new peoples, just the same peoples with new names and new locations (a typical motif of ancient history writing), Cassiodorus, and hence Jordanes, were able to equate the Goths with Scythians, Amazons, Getes, and Dacians: the Gothic kingdom was founded before Rome, and the Goths fought in the Trojan war. Under Berig the Goths crossed the Baltic in 1490 BC, and under Filimer they moved to the Black Sea only five generations later, i.e before any of the earliest mentions of the Goths.

As modern scholarship sifts through the ancient sources it becomes clear that, by the time of the fourth century, some twelve or thirteen groups of Goths are known from the records. Five coalesce in the fifth century to form the well-known Visigoths and Ostrogoths, while the others remain distinct (after Heather, 1996):

Visigoths:	 	1	 	the greater part of the Tervingi
 	 	2	 	the Greuthungi under Ermenaric
 	 	3	 	Goths led by Radagaisus
 	 	 	 	 
Ostrogoths:	 	4	 	Amal-led Goths
 	 	5	 	Goths under Theodoric Strabo
 	 	 	 	 
Others:	 	6	 	the remaining Tervingi, perhaps the same as those led by Arimer
 	 	7	 	Greuthungi led by Farnobius
 	 	8	 	Greuthungi led by Odotheus
 	 	9	 	Goths under Bigelis
 	 	10	 	Goths under Dengizich
 	 	11	 	Crimean Goths
 	 	12	 	Goths near the Sea of Azov
Ammanianus mentions that the Tervingi, groups 1 and 6, formed one unit; the Greuthungi under Ermenaric were another important political group of the 4th century. If the other groups eventually came under the control of Ermenaric, this might fall in line with the history of Jordanes; but the latter's account of Ermenaric is believed by some scholars to be more an embellished version of Ammianus' history rather than a previously attested tradition, and so Ermenaric's conquests have been exaggerated by Jordanes to put the Gothic leader on par with the later Attila.

In 399 the Roman poet Claudian wrote (In Eutropium, 2.152-153):

 	 	Ostrogothis colitur mixtisque Gruthungis Phryx ager
 	 	The Phrygian plain is inhabited by Ostrogoths and mixed Greuthungi.
If not merely a rhetorical device, this would make a further distinction between Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, both separate from the Tervingi, and thus adding to the number of Gothic tribes known in the 4th century.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is the nativity scene found in Luke 2:1-14. The Gothic text has somewhat redundant material in Luke 2.2: at [wisandin kindina Swriais] raginondin Saurim Kwreinaiau, leading scholars to believe that a marginal gloss has crept into the text during its transmission. This particular phrase shows the common construction at + substantive + participle, an absolute construction in Gothic similar to the genitive absolute in Greek, or the ablative absolute in Latin.

The text also contains other notable grammatical features. Luke 2.3 shows the occasional use in Gothic of ei + subjunctive for purpose clauses: iddjēdun allái, ei melidái wēseina. The demonstrative þō appears in Luke 2.6 to refer to Joseph and Mary; Gothic uses the neuter plural to refer to individuals of different genders. This however is not exclusive: compare ins in Luke 2.9. Luke 2.7 gives an example of the use of the genitive in negated clauses: ni was im rumis, literally 'there was not for them of room'.

In Luke 2.14 we find an instance of the Gothic translation remaining more faithful to the Greek than the English of the King James Version. Where the English is 'and on earth peace, good will toward men', with 'peace' and 'good will' in apposition, Gothic in fact preserves the Greek genitive in godis wiljins 'of good will', qualifying the phrase 'among men': 'among men of good will'. Compare the Vulgate in hominibus bonae voluntatis, which is elaborated in the Spanish en la tierra paz, a los hombres que aman el Senor 'on earth peace to those men who love the Lord.'

Translation
From the King James version:
2:1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. 2 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
 	 	14 Glory to God in the highest,
 	 	and on earth peace, good will toward men.
Grammar
1 The Alphabet
The Gothic alphabet closely resembles the Greek uncial alphabet of the fourth century AD. Where the Greek uncials proved insufficient for rendering some of the sounds, Roman or runic letters were borrowed. These alphabetic characters are also used to represent numerals. Rather than work with the Gothic alphabet itself, scholars generally work with a transliteration using the Roman alphabet, augmented with two additional characters and with the acute accent mark. The following chart lists the transliterated letters, their corresponding numerical values, and a rough guide to pronunciation.

Letter	 	Number	 	Pronunciation	 	Environment
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
a	 	1	 	[a], o as in 'cot'	 	 
 	 	 	 	[ā], a as in 'father'	 	 
b	 	2	 	[v], v as in 'have'	 	medially after vowel or diphthong
 	 	 	 	[b], b as in 'bob'	 	otherwise
g	 	3	 	[ŋ], n as in 'sing'	 	before k, g, q
 	 	 	 	[x], ch as in 'Bach'	 	finally, or before s, t
 	 	 	 	[ḡ], g as in North Ger. 'sagen'	 	otherwise
d	 	4	 	[ð], th as in 'father'	 	medially after vowel or diphthong
 	 	 	 	[d], d as in 'did'	 	otherwise
e	 	5	 	[ē], a as in 'gate'	 	 
q	 	6	 	[kw], qu as in 'queen'	 	 
z	 	7	 	[z], z as in 'buzz'	 	 
h	 	8	 	[x], ch as in 'Bach'	 	 
þ	 	9	 	[þ], th as in 'bath'	 	 
i	 	10	 	[i], i as in 'with'	 	 
k	 	20	 	[k], k as in 'kick'	 	 
l	 	30	 	[l], l as in 'lazy'	 	 
m	 	40	 	[m], m as in 'mouth'	 	 
n	 	50	 	[n], n as in 'nose'	 	 
j	 	60	 	[j], y as in 'you'	 	 
u	 	70	 	[u], o as in 'do it'	 	 
 	 	 	 	[ū], oo as in 'boot'	 	 
p	 	80	 	[p], p as in 'pin'	 	 
 	 	90	 	 	 	 
r	 	100	 	[r], trilled r as in Sp. 'rueda'	 	 
s	 	200	 	[s], s as in 'hiss'	 	 
t	 	300	 	[t], t as in 'tin'	 	 
w	 	400	 	[u], oo as in 'boot'	 	between consonants, finally after consonant
 	 	 	 	[w], w as in 'with'	 	otherwise
f	 	500	 	[f], f as in 'fife'	 	 
x	 	600	 	[k], k as in 'kick'	 	 
ƕ	 	700	 	[xw], ch w as in 'Bach was'	 	 
o	 	800	 	[ō], o as in 'phone'	 	 
 	 	900	 	 	 	 
We use the numerical values to establish the order of the alphabet. The numerical value assigned to each letter corresponds closely to the Greek system employed at the time, supporting the assertion initially based on visual similarity that the Gothic alphabet was in fact modeled on the Greek. The symbols used to represent 90 and 900 occur only in their numeral function, never representing sounds of the Gothic language. They consequently have no transliterations.

The duration of doubled consonants is roughly twice that of their single counterparts. For example, inn 'within' has the prolonged n sound in English 'penknife', while in 'into' has the short n of 'cannon'; fulla 'full' (strong adj., fem. nom. sg.) has the prolonged l of 'call later', while fula 'foal' (noun, fem. nom. sg.) has the short l of 'caller'. Similarly atta 'father' has the prolonged t of 'Fat Tuesday', and likewise for other consonants. The exception to this practice is gg. As in Greek, gg is used to represent the the sound of ng in English 'finger', cf. Goth. figgrs. This practice extends to all velars, so that g before any velar represents the same nasal sound before that velar. For example, gk in drigkan represents the nasal plus unvoiced velar plosive as in the corresponding English 'drink'; gq in sigqan 'sink' represents roughly the sound of nkw in English 'inkwell'. Some words -- e.g. bliggw- 'scourge', glaggw- 'accurate', skuggw- 'mirror', triggw- 'faithful' -- may have contained a true prolonged g as in (a slow pronunciation of) English 'doggone', but this has probably given way to the sound [ŋ] by the time of Wulfila's translation.

The letter w is often found in words borrowed from Greek, where the Greek contains upsilon. As can be seen from the alphabetic order and numerical value, the Gothic symbol for w actually is the Greek upsilon. For this reason some editors of Gothic texts instead use y in such loanwords, breaking from a more uniform transliteration with w. Thus Lwstrws, the dative plural of 'Lystra', is transcribed by some editors as Lystrys.

Other sounds of the Gothic language are represented by digraphs. Specifically, the long-i sound [ī] is represented by ei, mimicking the contemporaneous Greek pronunciation of epsilon followed by iota. The digraph ai has a threefold distinction. In some instances ai represents the short-e vowel [ɛ] found in Modern English 'bet' (or perhaps a slightly more open sound, as in the a of 'hat'). In other instances ai represents the long version of the same sound. And in the last instance ai represents the diphthong formed by its two constituents, namely the sound of i in Modern English 'white'. In transcription, these three values are distinguished by placement of an acute accent mark: aí is [ɛ], ai is [ɛ̄], and ái is [ai]. A similar threefold distinction holds for the digraph au: aú is the vowel sound in Modern English 'bought', au is a long version of the same sound, and áu is the diphthong represented by ou in Modern English 'about'. The digraph iu represents a falling diphthong (i.e. a diphthong accented on its first element) much like the eu of Modern English 'reuse' when the re- carries the stress. The situation is summarized in the following chart.

Digraph	 	Pronunciation
 	 	 
ei	 	[ī], ee as in 'meet'
aí	 	[ɛ], e as in 'bet'
ai	 	[ɛ̄], same as above, but prolonged
ái	 	[ai], i as in 'white'
aú	 	[ɔ], ou as in 'bought'
au	 	[ɔ̄], same as above, but prolonged
áu	 	[au], ou as in 'about'
iu	 	[íu], eu as in 'reuse'
It appears that these sounds were in fact all distinct in the period leading up to the emergence of Gothic and in its earliest stages. But the three values of ai may have merged by the time of Wulfila's translation, and likewise the three values of au may also have merged.

2 The Sound System
Being that of the earliest documented Germanic language, the sound system of Gothic is of great importance for historical studies. Some sound changes have occurred, however, in the span of time leading up to Wulfila's translation, so that Wulfila's own pronunciation is not necessarily the nearest approximation to the original sound system which Gothic inherited from Proto-Germanic. From a synchronic point of view, it is clear that o [ō] is already colored with some of the qualities of u, since we find spelling mistakes confusing the two, e.g. supūda for supōda. Likewise e [ē], though open, was close enough to be confused with ei [ī], e.g. qeins for qēns. It is also likely that h is in Wulfila's time closer to the h of Modern English 'he' than it is to the ch of 'Bach', and similarly with ƕ. Nevertheless, on etymological grounds and because of the archaic nature of the morphology, it is common in scholarship to ascribe values to Gothic letters which preserve the distinctions between, say, ei and ē, or between ái, ai, and aí, though they may be prior to Wulfila's time, and not in accordance with Wulfila's own pronunciation. By the same token, given the fact that the same spelling mistakes are made in several languages of the other branches of Germanic, it is possible that the distinctions were never actually as clean as the historical linguist would like. In this scenario, the marking of these distinctions is merely a theoretical construct, but one to which we shall nevertheless adhere.

We may group the archaic pronunciation of the Gothic consonants according to points of articulation. This is done in the following chart.

Consonants	 	 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Palatal (Alveolar)	 	Velar	 	Labio-Velar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stops	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	p	 	t, tt	 	 	 	k (x), kk	 	q
 	 	Voiced:	 	b	 	d, dd	 	 	 	g, gg [gg]	 	 
Fricatives	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	f	 	þ, þþ	 	 	 	h	 	ƕ
 	 	Voiced:	 	b [v]	 	d [ð]	 	 	 	g [ḡ]	 	 
Sibilants	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	 	 	s, ss	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiced:	 	 	 	z	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasals	 	 	 	m, mm	 	n, nn	 	 	 	gg [ŋ]	 	 
Liquids	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Continuant:	 	 	 	 	 	(l, ll)	 	 	 	 
 	 	Trilled:	 	 	 	 	 	(r, rr)	 	 	 	 
Semi-Vowels	 	 	 	w	 	 	 	j	 	 	 	 
Note that gg is listed among the nasals, reducing to g when marking a nasal before k or q. The letters b, d, and g appear both as stops and fricatives. The above chart is a phonetic, rather than phonemic, description. For example the difference in pronunciations of d is purely conditioned by environment (allophonic), never serving as the sole distinction of a word's change in meaning.

2.2 Vowels
The vowels may similarly be organized according to articulation. This is done in the following chart.

Short Vowels	 	Front	 	 	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	 	 	Back
 	 	Unrounded	 	 	 	 	 	Unrounded	 	 	 	 	 	Rounded
High	 	i	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	u
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Middle	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	aí	 	 	 	aú	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	a	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Long Vowels	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
High	 	ei	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ū
 	 	 	 	ē	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ō	 	 
Middle	 	 	 	 	 	ai	 	 	 	au	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ā	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note that the Gothic letters e and o always denote long vowels, ē and ō respectively. On the other hand, i always denotes a short vowel.

The above system is complemented by the three diphthongs ái, áu, iu, which are all stressed on the initial vowel. The resonants l, m, n, r may also function as vowels. For example: fugls 'bird', máiþms 'treasure', táikns 'token', ligrs 'bed'. The semivowel w may also form the nucleus of a syllable. For example, waúrstw 'work'.

2.3 Syllables and Stress
Conventionally scholars divide syllables in the Gothic language so that non-initial syllables begin with a consonant. Thus haír-tō 'heart', slē-piþ 'sleeps', af-lēt 'forgive thou'. Syllables ending in a short vowel are short, all others are considered long.

In general initial stress is the norm, though there are some exceptions. We may say there are three types of stress: primary, secondary, and weak stress. If we use bold italics to represent primary stress, italics for secondary stress, and no marking for weak stress, then these correspond to the stresses in the Modern English word 'incubate'. Primary stress falls on the first syllable, secondary stress on the last, and weak stress on the intervening syllable. The stress system of Gothic is similar. More specifically, root syllables bear primary stress when initial, secondary when non-initial. Consider the following examples:

Root	 	Initial	 	Non-initial
 	 	 	 	 
haírtō 'heart'	 	haírtō	 	hráinja-haírts
gulþ 'gold'	 	gulþ	 	figgra-gulþ
In matters of stress, it helps to realize that not all prefixes are equal. Adverbial prefixes to nouns, and the reduplicated syllables of verbs, follow the same rule as above. For example:

Prefix	 	Unprefixed	 	Prefixed
 	 	 	 	 
un- 'un-, not'	 	mahts	 	unmahts
saí- (redupl. syll.)	 	slē-piþ	 	saí-slēp
However, adverbial prefixes to verbs (i.e. preverbs) bear secondary stress. For example:

Prefix	 	Unprefixed	 	Prefixed
 	 	 	 	 
af 'from'	 	lēt	 	af-lēt
ana 'into'	 	saí-slēp	 	ana-saí-slēp
Thus stress alone may in some instances serve to distinguish verbs and nouns. Consider the following pair:

Prefix	 	Infinitive	 	Verb	 	Noun
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
af 'from'	 	lētan 'let'	 	af-lēt 'forgive thou'	 	af-lēt 'forgiveness' (acc.)
The contrast is similar to that found in Modern English 'project' (noun) vs. 'project' (verb). An exception to the secondary stress of preverbs is ga-, which carries weak stress: ga-saƕ 'saw'.

Suffix syllables (but not endings), when following a weakly stressed syllable, follow the accentuation rules of root syllables. Compare sal-bōnd 'they anoint' vs. salbō-dēdeina 'they might anoint'; mi-kils 'great' vs. mikil-dūþs 'greatness'.

Weak stress falls on syllables between those with primary or secondary stress. Compare -ra- in figgra-gulþ above, and also -na- in ana-saí-slēp. In general, the prefix ga-, the interrogative particle -u, and the conjunction -uh 'and' carry weak stress. For example: ga-leiks 'like'; ga-u-laubjats 'do ye two believe'; ub-uh-wōpida 'and he cried out'.

3 Noun Inflection and Strong Declension
Nouns in Gothic are inflected for case, number, and grammatical gender. There are three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, neuter. For nouns with clear sexual gender, the grammatical gender generally agrees with the sexual gender. For example, qēns 'woman' is feminine, so that natural gender and grammatical gender agree; but graba 'ditch' is also feminine, though the referent has no natural gender. There are two numbers: singular and plural (though personal pronouns and verbs also have a dual number). There are four cases: nominative (N), accusative (A), genitive (G), dative (D).

Case inflection is essentially a means of marking by suffixes grammatical functions which would otherwise be signalled by prepositions in Modern English. The most obvious remnant of the older case system in English is 's (apostrophe-s), which at the end of a noun fills the same role as the preposition of before a noun. For example, the bark of a dog is the same as a dog's bark. In much the same way, the nouns of Gothic use suffixes in order to denote grammatical function within a clause. Below is a short description of the case system of Gothic.

We may get a jump-start on nominal syntax if we step back for a moment and discuss what we might term logical cases. That is to say, before we pin down the meanings of the specific cases found in Gothic, we may first discuss a number of possible cases. We will take as our starting point the case system of Sanskrit, as being reasonably robust among the Indo-European languages. The chart below gives the eight cases found in the Sanskrit language, along with the basic meanings associated with those cases. (The fact that Sanskrit's case system is being used is immaterial -- the only purpose is to make certain logical distinctions among types of grammatical occurrences; the fact that these distinctions also happen to be made explicit in the suffixal system of a particular language is merely an added bonus.)

Logical Case	 	Description of Use	 	Basic Preposition	 	Example of Use
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	case of the subject	 	(none)	 	I killed him.
 	 	case of something predicated to the subject	 	(none)	 	The sky is blue.
Accusative	 	case of the direct object	 	(none)	 	I killed him.
 	 	case of the terminus of directed motion	 	(none), to(wards)	 	I ran (to the) east.
 	 	case of an expression involving extent in time or space	 	(none), for	 	The event lasted (for) five days.
Instrumental	 	case of the instrument of an action	 	with	 	I killed him with a knife.
 	 	case of accompaniment	 	with	 	I travelled with my friend.
Dative	 	case of the indirect object	 	(none)	 	He gave me a book.
 	 	 	 	to	 	He gave a book to me.
 	 	 	 	for	 	I wrote a recommendation letter for my student.
Ablative	 	case of origin, source, or separation	 	from	 	I went from New York to Austin.
Genitive	 	case of possession	 	of	 	The shoes of the man are dirty.
 	 	 	 	's	 	The man's shoes are dirty.
 	 	case of the sphere of relation	 	of	 	I shed tears of joy.
 	 	 	 	 	 	This soup needs a pinch of salt.
 	 	 	 	 	 	The canyon is a day's journey from here.
 	 	case of the subject or object of nominalized action	 	of, 's (s')	 	Man's killing of man speaks to human nature.
Locative	 	case of location in space or time	 	in, on, at, within	 	I stood on the corner for an hour.
Vocative	 	case of direct address	 	(none), o!	 	(O) Luck, be a lady tonight!
As one can see from the chart, the logical meanings of the cases may be expressed in a language, even if such a case system is not present. English retains overt marking only of the genitive, so that prepositions take over the role of the case system. Gothic declension, however, is more robust than that of Modern English, though more sparse than that of Sanskrit. One may then envision the syntax associated with the Gothic case system in terms of the following question: how do the eight logical cases above fit into the four extant cases of Gothic? The following chart gives the cases of Gothic, along with the logical cases whose role each has subsumed.

Gothic Case	 	Logical Case	 	Example	 	Translation
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	Nominative	 	frija ist þis witōdis	 	'she is free of that law'
 	 	Vocative	 	atta unsar þu in himinam	 	'our Father, thou in heaven'
Accusative	 	Accusative	 	gasaíƕiþ þana sunu mans	 	'ye shall see the son of man'
 	 	Vocative	 	hails þiudan Jūdaiē	 	'hail, king of the Jews'
Genitive	 	Genitive	 	gasaíƕiþ þana sunu mans	 	'ye shall see the son of man'
 	 	Ablative	 	frija ist þis witōdis	 	'she is free of (from) that law'
Dative	 	Dative	 	gif mis sei undrinnái mik dáil áiginis	 	'give me the portion of property which is coming to me'
 	 	Instrumental	 	wōpida Iēsus stibnái mikilái	 	'Jesus cried with a loud voice'
 	 	Locative	 	swēgnida ahmin Iēsus	 	'Jesus rejoiced in spirit'
 	 	Ablative	 	sa afar mis gagganda swinþōza mis ist	 	'he who comes after me is mightier than me'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The above identifications are not iron-clad, nor should they be taken for actual historical evolution. But they do go a long way to explaining the syntactic descriptions of Gothic case usage found in the standard handbooks.

Like the other Germanic languages, Gothic has strong and weak nominal declensions. These are terms originally applied by J. Grimm to distinguish two types of declension within Germanic languages. Among nouns, the property of being strong or weak is inherent, each noun being either strong (only) or weak (only). Adjectives, by contrast, can be strong or weak depending on the situation: adjectives are declined strong when indefinite, weak when definite.

3.1 a/ja/wa-Stems
The a/ja/wa-stem nouns historically derive from o/jo/wo-stem nouns, respectively, and some grammars use the historical terminology. These nouns are generally masculine or neuter. Among masculine nouns, dags 'day' and hláifs 'loaf, bread' are a-stems; harjis 'army' and haírdeis 'herdsman' are ja-stems; þius 'servant' is a wa-stem. Their declensions are as follows.

Masculine	 	a-Stem	 	 	 	ja-Stem	 	 	 	wa-Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	daga-	 	hláiba-	 	harja-	 	haírdja-	 	þiwa-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	dags	 	hláifs	 	harjis	 	haírdeis	 	*þius
A, V	 	dag	 	hláif	 	*hari	 	haírdi	 	*þiu
G	 	dagis	 	hláibis	 	harjis	 	haírdeis	 	*þiwis
D	 	daga	 	hláiba	 	harja	 	haírdja	 	*þiwa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	dagōs	 	hláibōs	 	harjōs	 	haírdjōs	 	þiwōs
A	 	dagans	 	hláibans	 	harjans	 	haírdjans	 	*þiwans
G	 	dagē	 	hláibē	 	*harjē	 	haírdjē	 	þiwē
D	 	dagam	 	hláibam	 	harjam	 	haírdjam	 	*þiwam
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
When the nominative singular ends in -s, the -s is lost for the vocative, and so the vocative and accusative fall together. In the plural, nominative and vocative are the same. Note the substitution of b for f between vowels in the paradigm of hláifs; that is, intervocalic [f] becomes the voiced allophone [v].

Final -s drops when it immediately follows the combination (short vowel) + (consonantal r). For example one finds nominative singular waír + s > waír 'man', baúr + s > baúr 'son', both nouns following the declension of dags.

Among neuter nouns, waúrd 'word' and witōþ 'law' are a-stems; kuni 'race' and reiki 'kingdom' are ja-stems; kniu 'knee' is a wa-stem. Their declensions are as follows.

Neuter	 	a-Stem	 	 	 	ja-Stem	 	 	 	wa-Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	waúrda-	 	witōda-	 	kunja-	 	reikja-	 	kniwa-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	waúrd	 	witōþ	 	kuni	 	reiki	 	*kniu
A	 	waúrd	 	witōþ	 	kuni	 	reiki	 	*kniu
G	 	waúrdis	 	witōdis	 	kunjis	 	reikjis	 	*kniwis
D	 	waúrda	 	witōda	 	kunja	 	reikja	 	*kniwa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	waúrda	 	witōda	 	kunja	 	reikja	 	*kniwa
A	 	waúrda	 	witōda	 	kunja	 	reikja	 	kniwa
G	 	waúrdē	 	witōdē	 	kunjē	 	reikjē	 	kniwē
D	 	waúrdam	 	witōdam	 	kunjam	 	reikjam	 	kniwam
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The nominative and accusative singular forms of neuter nouns are always identical, as are the plural forms. The vocative is identical with these. As with f and b in hláifs, the þ of witōþ alternates with d between vowels: intervocalic [þ] becomes the voiced allophone [ð].

3.2 ō/jō/wō-Stems
The ō/jō/wō-stem nouns historically derive from ā/jā/wā-stem nouns, respectively. These nouns are exclusively feminine. The noun giba 'gift' is an ō-stem; sunja 'truth', bandi 'band, bond', and mawi 'maiden' are jō-stems; triggwa 'covenant' is a wō-stem. Their declensions are as follows.

Feminine	 	ō-Stem	 	jō-Stem	 	 	 	 	 	wō-Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	gibō-	 	sunjō-	 	bandjō-	 	máujō-	 	triggwō-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	giba	 	sunja	 	bandi	 	mawi	 	triggwa
A	 	giba	 	sunja	 	bandja	 	máuja	 	triggwa
G	 	gibōs	 	sunjōs	 	bandjōs	 	máujōs	 	triggwōs
D	 	gibái	 	sunjái	 	bandjái	 	máujái	 	triggwái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	gibōs	 	sunjōs	 	bandjōs	 	máujōs	 	triggwōs
A	 	gibōs	 	sunjōs	 	bandjōs	 	máujōs	 	triggwōs
G	 	gibō	 	sunjō	 	bandjō	 	máujō	 	triggwō
D	 	gibōm	 	sunjōm	 	bandjōm	 	maujōm	 	triggwōm
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The declension of wō-stems follows that of the ō-stems. The jō-stems fall into two types, depending on whether or not the nominative and accusative singular forms are the same.

4 Strong Verb Conjugation
Verbs in Gothic, as in the other Germanic languages, fall into two categories: strong and weak. These terms have no relation to the same names applied to nouns and adjectives.

There are two tenses in Gothic, present and preterite. As with other Indo-European languages exhibiting this type of two-tense system, the distinction between preterite and present is the distinction between past and non-past, since the present forms are used for both present and future. This is similar to Modern English 'I am going on vacation next week', where the present tense has future meaning, equivalent to 'will go'. Likewise, the preterite forms subsume the roles of several different tenses in Modern English, such as the simple past 'did', perfect 'has done', and pluperfect 'had done'. There are three moods: indicative, subjunctive, imperative. The moods are formed with either the preterite or present stems, except for the imperative, which only employs the present stem. Generally the past subjunctive forms denote potential completed actions, whereas the present subjunctive has no such implication of completion. This parallels somewhat Modern English 'might have done' vs. 'might do'. There are also two voices in Gothic: active and (medio)passive.

4.1 Strong Verb Classes
As in English, ablaut, or vowel gradation, characterizes the strong verbs of Gothic. This system employs vowel alternation within a root to signify change in meaning or function. Take, for example, the English forms: sing-sang-sung-song. Within the base s-ng, an i gives present forms, an a past forms, a u the past participle, and o a derived noun. Other verbs may follow the same ablaut pattern in full or in part, e.g. ring-rang-rung (with no o-grade form). Still other verbs follow an entirely different ablaut pattern, e.g. hold-held-held.

There are seven classes of strong verbs. Six of these are characterized solely by ablaut. The seventh is characterized by reduplication, or by reduplication coupled with ablaut. In order to distinguish, then, the different ablaut classes, specific forms are listed illustrating the gradation sequence. This can be accomplished by listing four principal parts, from which all forms of a given verb may be derived:

1st Principal Part, from which are derived all forms of the present;
2nd Principal Part, from which are derived the finite forms of the preterite singular;
3rd Principal Part, from which are derived all non-singular finite forms of the preterite;
4th Principal Part, from which is derived the preterite participle.
The forms chosen as principal parts are, respectively, (1) the infinitive, (2) the first (or third) person singular preterite, (3) the first person plural preterite, (4) the nominative singular masculine preterite participle. The different strong verb classes are listed below with verbs illustrating the vowel gradation.

Class	 	Meaning	 	(1) Infinitive	 	(2) 1st Sg. Pret.	 	(3) 1st Pl. Pret.	 	(4) Past Ptcple.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Ia	 	'ascend'	 	steigan	 	stáig	 	stigum	 	stigans
Ib	 	'tell'	 	ga-teihan	 	ga-táih	 	ga-taíhum	 	ga-taíhans

 	 	'shut'	 	ga-lūkan	 	ga-láuk	 	ga-lukum	 	ga-lukans
IIb	 	'lead'	 	tiuhan	 	táuh	 	taúhum	 	taúhans
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
IIIa	 	'bind'	 	bindan	 	band	 	bundum	 	bundans
IIIb	 	'become'	 	waírþan	 	warþ	 	waúrþum	 	waúrþans
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
IVa	 	'come'	 	qiman	 	qam	 	qēmum	 	qumans
IVb	 	'bear'	 	baíran	 	bar	 	bērum	 	baúrans
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Va	 	'say'	 	qiþan	 	qaþ	 	qēþum	 	qiþans
Vb	 	'see'	 	saíƕan	 	saƕ	 	sēƕum	 	saíƕans
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VI	 	'rebuke'	 	sakan	 	sōk	 	sōkum	 	sakans
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VIIa	 	'call'	 	háitan	 	haíháit	 	haíháitum	 	háitans
VIIb	 	'let'	 	lētan	 	laílōt	 	laílōtum	 	lētans
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
As can be seen, the singular and plural preterite forms of class VII are derived from the same stem. The seventh class functions somewhat differently from the rest, and this will be treated in more detail in a later lesson.

4.2 Active Paradigm
The class IV verb baíran 'bear, carry' illustrates the active forms of the strong verb.

Strong Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative

Past Ptc.	 	baúrans	 	 	 	 
Note how all present forms are built from the first principal part, and all the preterite forms except the singular are built from the third principal part. The second principal part supplies the singular preterite forms, and the fourth principal part the preterite participle.

4.3 Mediopassive Paradigm
The notion of voice concerns the way in which logical action is manifested in a grammatical statement. By 'logical action' is meant action in the abstract, or the underlying process being referred to. Any action may be referred to in a number of ways, and the morphology of the language dictates whether different expressions of the same action may be rendered concisely or through circumlocution. Within the arena of logical action, one may distinguish agent and patient. The agent is the logical actor, the one doing the logical action; the patient, by contrast, is the one undergoing the logical action, the logical recipient. Within the arena of the grammatical action, one distinguishes the (grammatical) subject and the (direct) object. The grammatical subject denotes the one performing the action expressed by the verb in the statement; the direct object denotes the recipient of that verbal action, when different from the grammatical subject. A statement is active when agent and subject are the same. For example, 'I ate the cookie' is active; the logical action is that of 'eating', and 'I' is the agent of this logical action. 'I' is also the subject of the verb expressed: 'ate'. Here the patient, 'the cookie', is the direct object. On the other hand, a statement is passive when patient and subject are the same. For example, 'The cookie was eaten (by me)'. Here again the logical action is 'eating', and 'I' is the agent, while 'the cookie' is still the patient. But now the patient is the subject of the verb expressed: 'was eaten'. The agent, 'I', need not even be expressed, though it is possible with the phrase 'by me'.

A third voice is distinguished, called the middle voice. The middle voice is somewhere between the active and passive voices, where the distinction between agent and patient is blurred. In many of the ancient Indo-European languages, this voice denotes action which is reflexive (e.g. 'you'll get (yourself) killed'), for the personal benefit of the subject (e.g. 'I had a house built'), or representing an internal process (e.g. 'I wondered at its beauty'). In these languages, the morphology denoting the middle voice is often the same as that denoting the passive. Such uses of the morphological passive in Gothic are not very common, and the term mediopassive, rather than simply passive, is employed based largely on historical and comparative grounds.

Gothic has a morphological mediopassive only in the present. The forms of baíran 'carry' illustrate the conjugation.

5 Word Order and Concord
Any mention of Gothic word order and syntax must begin by saying that the Gothic translation of the New Testament follows the Greek extremely closely. The case system of Gothic is as robust as that of Greek, so that one to one correspondence of constructions is possible. Nevertheless, Gothic use often departs from Greek use, perhaps most conspicuously in the occurrence of Greek genitive absolute constructions, which are rendered in Gothic by dative constructions. (Ironically, the same dative rendering occurs in Old Church Slavonic, which possesses an even richer case system.)

In matters of word order, then, the concern is not solely to what degree the extant Gothic matches its Greek source, but also to what degree the extant Gothic matches patterns expected by comparison with other Germanic languages. Because of the antiquity of the Gothic documents and the general conservatism Gothic displays in morphology, the most pertinent comparanda are the early runic inscriptions. As the Gallehus inscription, c. 400 AD, shows,

 	 	ek hlewagastiz holtijaz horna tawidō
 	 	I, Hlewagastiz, son of Holtagastiz, the horn made
the unemphatic word order of the earliest Germanic documents was predominantly

 	 	(Subject) + Object + Verb.
This word order apparently lasted well into the time period of the Gothic documents. The same word order is frequently found in the Old English poem Beowulf, as in the opening lines:

 	 	Hwæt, wē Gār-dena in gēardagum
 	 	þēodcyninga þrym gefrūnon,
 	 	hū ðā æþelingas ellen fremedon.
 	 	 
 	 	Listen! We have heard the glory of the Spear-danes,
 	 	of the people's kings, in days past,
 	 	how the heroes performed courageous deeds.
In both clauses, the verbs (gefrūnon, fremedon) occupy the last position, and the object directly precedes them. Such word order is even found in comparative constructions in Old English, e.g. stāne heardran 'than-stone harder', and in Old Norse, e.g. sólo fegra 'than-(the)-sun fairer'. It is then quite likely that typical Gothic word order -- that is, word order emphasizing no particular element of the utterance -- during the time of Wulfila's translation was also SOV. The Gothic translation of Mark 8.23,

 	 	frah ina ga-u-ƕa-seƕi
 	 	asked him if he saw anything
is, as often, a word-for-word translation of the Greek. But the second clause ga-u-ƕa-seƕi suggests that the tendency for object to precede verb was strong enough that the object could even intervene between verb and prefix.

Wulfila's translation of the New Testament, however, frequently departs from SOV word order, and does so more often than one would expect if such departure were merely for stylistic reasons. For example, simple declarative sentences often have the structure

 	 	Subject + Verb (+ Adverb) (+ Object),
as in mannē sums áihta twans sununs 'a certain one among men had two sons' (Luke 15.11). This generally agrees with the Greek word order. When the Adverb is placed first, the Verb often follows directly, and the Subject is moved to the position following the Verb:

 	 	Adverb + Verb + Subject (+ Object),
e.g. suns qimiþ Satans 'immediately Satan comes' (Mark 4.15). This also agrees with the Greek. The common conjunction jah 'and' is frequently followed by the verb of the second clause. Thus,

 	 	S + V (+ Adv) (+ O) + jah + V + S (+ O).
For example, þaruh is qaþ du imma þatei brōþar þeins qam, jah afsnáiþ atta þeins stiur þana alidan 'then he said to him (that) your brother came, and your father killed a fattened calf' (Luke 15.27). Again this construction agrees with the Greek. When Gothic breaks with Greek word order, it frequently reverts back to verb-final word order: jah gaírnida sad itan haúrnē þōei matidēdun sweina, jah manna imma ni gaf 'and he yearned to eat his fill of the husks which the swine were eating, and the man did not give him (any)' (Luke 15.16). Here the Greek has kai oudeis edídou autōi, literally 'and no one gave to him'.

As the verb-final structure of Modern German subordinate clauses and Modern English indirect questions shows, one might expect subordinate clauses in Gothic to preserve SOV word order. But even here the word order tends to follow the same Greek patterns found in main clauses:

 	 	Relative (+ Subject) + Verb (+ Adverb) (+ Object), or
 	 	Relative (+ Adverb) + Verb (+ Subject) (+ Object).
For example, und þatei usleiþiþ himins jah aírþa, jōta áins aíþþáu áins striks ni usleiþiþ af witōda 'up to the point when heaven and earth pass, not one iota or one bit shall pass from the law' (Matthew 5.18). If the subject is simply a single relative pronoun, then the dependent word order may be

 	 	Rel.Pron. + Verb (+ Adverb) (+ Object), or
 	 	Rel.Pron. + Adverb + Verb (+ Object).
For example, iþ þan sa sunus þeins, saei frēt þein swēs miþ kalkjōm, qam 'but then your son, who squandered your fortune on harlots, came' (Luke 15.30).

An adjective may either precede or follow its referent. They agree in gender, case, and number, with some exceptions. Feminine substantives are occasionally modified by masculine adjectives, or even neuter if the feminine noun denotes a thing. For example, ei kanniþ wēsi... handugei guþs 'that the wisdom of God... might be known' (Ephesians 3.10), where the neuter adjective kanniþ 'known' modifies the feminine abstract noun handugei 'wisdom'. A plural adjective or pronoun referring to two nouns of different gender is put in the neuter, e.g. ba (Zakarias jah Aileisabaiþ) framaldra wesun 'both (Zachary and Elizabeth) were very old' (Luke 1.7). A possessive pronoun generally follows the noun it governs, e.g. ahman izōs 'her spirit', and likewise for possessive adjectives: atta þeins 'your father', miþ frijōndam meináim 'with my friends'. Though there is a definite article in Gothic, or rather a demonstrative adjective which frequently assumes the role of an article, it often does not modify a noun governed by a genitive, e.g. in þiudangardjái himinē 'in the kingdom of heaven'. Either noun, however, may also appear with an article: þana attan þizōs máujōs 'the father of the(se) maidens'.

The general conservatism displayed by Gothic in terms of morphology leads scholars to expect the unemphatic word order was typically SOV in accordance with the earliest Germanic inscriptions. The Gothic New Testament however generally looks to be a mirror image of its Greek model. Given the rich morphology of the Gothic language, such word order would not have posed much difficulty for the intended audience, be it a native speaker's choice of word order or not.

Archaeological Origins of the Goths
Definite archaeological remains of the early Goths are even more elusive than clear literary references. Part of the problem concerns dating: the are many sites which offer possible remains of Gothic culture, but the relevant timeframes are difficult to establish. In general closed archaeological finds (e.g. burial finds) with Roman coins and pottery provide the best sources for dating, but the time lag between production and placement leaves a certain amount of uncertainty. It is therefore easier to establish relative chronology by looking at the development of certain specific types of objects, e.g. brooches, buckles, pots, combs. The simpler forms are considered earlier, the more complex later. Such dating, however, does not apply well to individual objects, rather only to groups of objects. The more objects in a closed area, the more secure the relative chronology.

This still leaves open a crucial issue, namely that a material culture is not the same as an ethnic culture, or even political, social, or linguistic culture. Material items, and technology in general, have the ability to move across socio-ethnic boundaries much quicker than linguistic or ethnic traits. When however archaeologists discover not only continuity of material items, but also of ritual practice, such as burial rites, then this strengthens the argument that the material in question is associated with a somewhat homogenous culture. Keeping these caveats in mind, then, we may discuss the two cultures on which archaeologists have focused in their attempts to find physical traces of the Goths.

Wielbark Culture
The Wielbark culture is named after an area in the north of present-day Poland in which many characteristic remains were discovered. This material culture formed in the middle of 1st century AD in Pomerania on both sides of the Vistula, which is roughly the area in which Tacitus, Ptolemy, and Strabo place the Goths, and at roughly the same time. An early phase of development lasted for roughly a century. Then followed a second phase which spread over a wider area, first encompassing the northernmost regions of Poland and Mazovia east of the Vistula (c. 160-210), and then extending farther south along the Vistula, San, and Bug rivers into Byelorussia, Volhynia, and northern Ukraine (c. 180-230). This area is where the Chernjakhov culture, discussed below, later developed.

The Wielbark culture is characterized by stone circles found in cemeteries. In trying to align the movement of this culture with the picture presented in the literary record, especially as pertains to the purported Scandinavian origin of the Goths, it is important to find traits common to material cultures both in Scandinavia and on the southern shore of the Baltic, and furthermore among which the Scandinavian finds are the clear antecedents. These stone circles in cemeteries are the only practice found to be earlier in Scandinavia than on the European mainland. They do not, however, appear in the earliest Wielbark cemeteries.

Another trait of the culture is that inhumation and cremation graves are found side by side in Wielbark cemeteries. Surrounding burial sites do not display this two-fold practice, but instead display only cremation burials. A rather peculiar trait is that the members of the Wielbark culture did not bury iron objects, most importantly weapons, with any male dead. By contrast, the surrounding sites, as well as earlier inhabitants of the same areas, did bury iron weapons with the dead. Thus, if this culture does in fact represent the archaeological remains of the Goths, they appear to have broken with the typical Germanic tradition of burying the dead with their weapons. In addition, women's dress, at least in burials, was characterized by a double brooch, one on each shoulder.

The period of the second phase of the Wielbark culture coincides with the Marcomannic wars, c. 150 AD, which caused dramatic changes in the material cultures of present-day Poland. This phase of the Wielbark culture spread into the area of the Przeworsk culture, the area south of Pomerania, between the Notec and Warta rivers, and to Masovia in the southeast. The period 180-300 AD finds not only the expansion of Wielbark culture, but the incorporation of Wielbark traits into other cultures, particularly the Chernjakhov.

Chernjakhov Culture
The Chernjakhov culture began in the middle of the 3rd century. It reached its fullest extent in the 4th century, covering a large area between the Danube and Don, to the north and west of the Black Sea, and to the south and east of the Carpathian mountains. The temporal overlap with the Wielbark culture is also physically accompanied by shared features of material culture, particularly handmade pottery, some types of brooch, and the style of women's dress.

More intriguing, perhaps, are the shared cultural practices. As with the Wielbark culture, the Chernjakhov culture left behind cemeteries with mixed inhumation and cremation burials. The majority of Chernjakhov inhumation graves are placed along a north-south line, with the head of the deceased to the north. Also like the Wielbark culture, the Chernjakhov culture did not bury weapons with their male dead. There are however a few cemeteries in Cozia-Iasi, Todireni, and Braniste where the dead were buried with weapons. These weapons may have originated outside the Wielbark culture, though, perhaps in Przeworsk; the other equipment is consonant with the idea of Germanic intruders from the north. They also buried some wheel-made pottery with the dead, as well as some bone combs and iron implements.

The houses of the Chernjakhov culture are of two types. The most numerous are sunken huts. These are usually rectangular, though there are some with a more oval shape. These huts are cut into the ground, some so deep that only roofing would need to be added. The earthen floors are generally between 5 and 16 square meters. The walls were wattle and daub, and each house had a hearth. The other type of houses were surface dwellings. These are often found in the same settlements as the sunken huts. The smaller ones are usually between 6 and 8 square meters, the larger between 11 and 16 square meters. They were divided in two parts, one providing quarters for people, the other for animals.

If the Chernjakhov culture is in fact the continuation of the Wielbark culture, then the shared burial practices, as well as the shared mode of women's dress and the style of other implements, show not only a carryover of material culture, but also a carryover of social customs and beliefs. The Wielbark culture did not nevertheless cease to exist when the Chernjakhov culture began. The latter is therefore unlikely to be the result of a near total migration of the former.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage, Luke 2:41-52, gives an account of an incident in Jesus's boyhood, the only boyhood incident reported in the New Testament. Luke says that Jesus was twelve years old: the Gothic translates twalibwintrus, literally 'twelve winters' (Luke 2.42). Ancient Germanic cultures often used 'winter' as an equivalent of 'year' when reckoning spans of time. Similar constructions occur in both the Old English Beowulf and the Old Saxon Heliand: xii wintra tīd 'a span of twelve winters' (B.147); gebad wintra worn 'he endured countless winters' (B.264); Huand wit habdun aldres ēr efno tuēntig uuintro an uncro uueroldi, ēr than quāmi that uuīb ti mi 'the two of us had an age of about twenty winters in our world when that woman came to me' (H.144-145). Even the Old English translation of this biblical passage has and ða he wæs twelf wintre, hy foron to Hierusalem 'and when he was twelve winters (old), they went to Jerusalem'.

This phrase is followed by an example of the Gothic dative absolute: jah biþē warþ twalibwintrus, usgaggandam þan im in Iaírusaúlwma bi biūhtja dulþáis jah ustiuhandam þans dagans, literally 'when he became twelve-years-old, (with) them then going out to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast, and (with them) fulfilling the days...' (Luke 2.42-43). These absolute constructions constitute a substantive and associated participle to give what would be in English a subordinate clause.

Luke 2.48 provides a notable instance in which Gothic employs the plural where one might expect the dual: ƕa gatawides uns swa? sai, sa atta þeins jah ik winnandona sokidedum þuk 'why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.' Here uns and sokidedum clearly refer to Mary and Joseph, and so the reader might expect the dual ugkis for uns and the dual sokidedu for sokidedum. Evidently the dual in Gothic, as in many other Indo-European languages, was a category in decline (by the time of the New Testament it had completely fallen out of the Greek language). In this particular instance, as some scholars suggest, the difference in gender (as evidenced by the neuter form of the adjective winnandona) might have triggered the use of the plural in place of the dual. But in other passages we find the plural replacing the dual with no obvious trigger.

Luke 2.49 also begins with an interesting collocation: ƕa þatei sōkidēduþ mik? The phrase ƕa þatei is a compressed phrase 'what is this?', the þata then pointing to what follows, hence the relative marker ei. This phrase has, by the time of the Gothic text, become frozen as a way of saying 'why'. A similar development happened within Latin during the Middle Ages, where quid est quod -- literally 'what is (this, the fact) that...' -- came simply to denote 'why'.

Translation
From the King James version:
2:41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. 44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. 45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. 46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. 47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? 50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
Grammar
6 Sound Rules
6.1 Rules Characterizing Germanic: Grimm's and Verner's Laws
The most conspicuous sound shift affecting the Germanic languages is Grimm's Law. According to this rule, the following sound correspondences obtain between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Germanic:

PIE	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	PGmc	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	p	 	t	 	k	 	kw	 	 	 	f	 	þ	 	x	 	xw
 	 	b	 	d	 	g	 	gw	 	 	 	p	 	t	 	k	 	kw
 	 	bh	 	dh	 	gh	 	gwh	 	 	 	b	 	d	 	g	 	gw
In addition

 	 	p, t, k remain unchanged after s, and
 	 	t remains unchanged after p, k.
Certain discrepancies in the correspondences appear upon closer inspection of the data. In particular, one frequently finds that the Germanic voiceless spirants (f, þ, x, xw) and s become voiced:

 	 	f, þ, x, xw, s > v, ð, ḡ, ḡw, z.
Many of these counterexamples are explained by Verner's Law. This states that the voiceless spirants remain when initial, or when immediately preceded by the PIE accent. For example, *t > þ in PIE *bhréH-ter > Gothic broþar, but *t > ð in PIE *pH-tér > fadar [faðar]. Note in this last example that initial *p > f, with no voicing.

Consider the following examples:

PIE	 	Comparandum	 	PGmc	 	Gothic	 	Shift	 	Law
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
p-	 	podós (Gk.)	 	f-	 	fōtáus 'of the foot'	 	p > f	 	Grimm
-p-	 	kléptēs (Gk.)	 	-f-	 	hliftus 'thief'	 	p > f	 	Grimm
-p-	 	kapálam (Skt.)	 	-v-	 	háubiþ 'head'	 	p > v	 	Verner
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
t-	 	tu (Lat.)	 	þ-	 	þu 'thou'	 	t > þ	 	Grimm
-t-	 	várte (Skt.)	 	-þ-	 	waírþa 'I become'	 	t > þ	 	Grimm
-t-	 	patér (Gk.)	 	-ð-	 	fadar 'father'	 	t > ð	 	Verner
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
k-	 	cordis (Lat.)	 	x-	 	haírtins 'of the heart'	 	k > x	 	Grimm
-k-	 	déka (Gk.)	 	-x-	 	taíhun 'ten'	 	k > x	 	Grimm
k-	 	com-mūnis (Lat.)	 	-ḡ-	 	ga-máins 'common'	 	k > ḡ	 	Verner
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
s-	 	sá (Skt.)	 	s-	 	sa 'that'	 	s > s	 	Grimm
-s-	 	geú(s)ō (Gk.)	 	-s-	 	kiusa 'I choose'	 	s > s	 	Grimm
-s-	 	bhárase (Skt.)	 	-z-	 	baíraza 'art borne'	 	s > z	 	Verner
Note in the instance of Latin commūnis and Gothic gamáins that Verner's Law applies to proclitics. The example of Sanskrit bhárase and Gothic baíraza illustrates that the accent must be on the vowel immediately preceding the consonant for Grimm's Law to apply.

6.2 Rules Characterizing Gothic
Among the ancient Germanic languages Gothic is uniquely conservative in terms of phonology. As will be seen in the section on the weak preterite, the dental suffix retains a fuller expression than in languages such as Old English or Old Norse. Gothic also preserves a situation which precedes regular umlaut due to i in a following syllable. For example, compare Gothic alþeis 'old' and alþiza 'older' to Old English eald and ieldra, respectively; similarly compare PGmc. *gastiz > Goth. gasts to Old Norse gestr.

Gothic does, however, show some important sound changes. Some of the more notable examples appear below.

6.2.1 Initial *fl-

Initial *fl- > þl- in syllables ending in h /x/. Compare Old Saxon and Old High German fliohan 'flee' to Gothic þliuhan. The same may also occur in stems ending in q /kw/: for example, Gothic þlaqus 'putting out leaves, tender' with possible relation to Old High German flah 'flat', Latin placidus ('flat, even' and hence) 'gentle, quiet'. The change *fl- > þl- does not occur in stems with other final consonants. For example, compare Gothic flōdus to Old English and Old Saxon flōd 'flood, stream'.

6.2.2 Final -s

As mentioned in Section 3.1, final -s > zero before (short vowel) + (consonantal r). For example, waír + -s > waír 'man'; similarly baúr 'son', anþar 'second', unsar 'our'. Compare dags 'day', gasts 'guest', akrs 'field', swērs 'honored', skeirs 'clear', G brōþrs 'of a brother'.

Additionally, -s > zero before stem-final s. For example, runs + -s > runs 'a running'. Compare accusative runs, showing the s is part of the stem, not the nominative ending.

6.3 Sound Changes in Gothic Strong Preterites
Several sound changes occur frequently when consonants become final in the past tense or combine with the second person singular past tense ending -t. These are collected here for reference.

Final b > f after a vowel or diphthong in the 1st and 3rd person singular, e.g. gadaban 'be fitting' yields gadōf.
Final d > þ after a vowel or diphthong in the 1st and 3rd person singular, e.g. bidjan 'entreat' yields baþ.
b > f before -t in the 2nd person singular, e.g. giban 'give' yields gaft.
d > s before -t in the 2nd person singular, e.g. anabiudan 'command' yields anabáust.
t > s before -t in the 2nd person singular, e.g. bigitan 'find' yields bigast.
þ > s before -t in the 2nd person singular, e.g. qiþan 'say' yields qast.
7 Strong Declension
7.1 i-Stems
Several nouns have stems ending in i. As mentioned above, this does not lead to regular umlaut of the root vowel as it does in other Germanic languages such as Old Norse and Old English. The nouns gards 'court', staþs 'place', and gasts 'guest' illustrate the masculine forms of the i-declension; ansts 'grace', fahēþs 'joy', and qēns 'woman' illustrate the feminine forms. Recall that ei is the Gothic spelling of [ī].

i-Stem	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	gardi-	 	stadi-	 	gasti-	 	ansti-	 	fahēdi-	 	qēni-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	gards	 	staþs	 	gasts	 	ansts	 	fahēþs	 	qēns
A, V	 	gard	 	staþ	 	gast	 	anst	 	fahēþ	 	qēn
G	 	gardis	 	stadis	 	gastis	 	anstáis	 	fahēdáis	 	qēnáis
D	 	garda	 	stada	 	gasta	 	anstái	 	fahēdái	 	qēnái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	gardeis	 	stadeis	 	gasteis	 	ansteis	 	fahēdeis	 	qēneis
A	 	gardins	 	stadins	 	gastins	 	anstins	 	fahēdins	 	qēnins
G	 	gardē	 	stadē	 	gastē	 	anstē	 	fahēdē	 	qēnē
D	 	gardim	 	stadim	 	gastim	 	anstim	 	fahēdim	 	qēnim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note that, because of the lack of umlaut, the singular forms of masculine i-stems parallel those of the a-stems. Feminine abstract nouns in -ōns and -áins, derived from verbs of the second and third weak conjugation, decline like ansts. For example, laþōns 'invitation' from laþōn 'to invite', mitōns 'a thought' from mitōn 'to think over', bauáins 'a dwelling' from bauan 'to inhabit', libáins 'life' from liban 'to live'.

Some nouns which belong to the i-declension in Gothic belong to the a-declension in sister languages. For example, compare Gothic gards to the Old Norse a-stem garðr, but Goth. gasts and ON gestr are both i-declension. By contrast, Gothic qēns appears both as i-stem in the Eddic form kvæn and as the ōn-stem kona (G pl. kvenna) in Old Norse.

The masculine noun náus 'corpse' has plural forms N. naweis and A. nawins. The feminine noun háims 'village' follows the declension of ansts in the singular, but follows the ō-stem giba in the plural (see Section 3.2). Feminine abstract nouns in -eins follow the declension of ansts, except for N pl. -ōs and G pl. -ō. The forms of the masculine náus 'corpse' and of the feminine háims 'village' and láiseins 'doctrine' are given below.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	nawi-	 	háimi-	 	láiseini-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	náus	 	háims	 	láiseins
A, V	 	 	 	háim	 	láisein
G	 	 	 	háimáis	 	láiseináis
D	 	 	 	háimái	 	láiseinái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	naweis	 	háimōs	 	láiseinōs
A	 	nawins	 	háimō	 	láiseinins
G	 	 	 	háimō	 	láiseinō
D	 	 	 	háimōm	 	láiseinim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
7.2 u-Stems
The u-stem nouns appear in all genders, though there are few remnants of neuter forms. The masculine sunus 'son', feminine handus 'hand', and neuter faíhu 'cattle' illustrate the declension.

u-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	sunu-	 	handu-	 	faíhu-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sunus	 	handus	 	faíhu
A, V	 	sunu	 	handu	 	faíhu
G	 	sunáus	 	handáus	 	*faíháus
D	 	sunáu	 	handáu	 	faíháu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	sunjus	 	handjus	 	 
A	 	sununs	 	handuns	 	 
G	 	suniwē	 	handiwē	 	 
D	 	sunum	 	handum	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Some scribes write N sg. sunáus beside sunus, D sg. sunu beside sunáu, and V sg. sunáu beside sunu. The neuter noun filu 'much' falls under this declension, with G sg. filáus used adverbially with comparatives in the sense 'very'.

8 Personal Pronouns
Because of the rich morphology of the Gothic verb, subject pronouns are generally unnecessary. They are used only for emphasis. In addition to singular and plural, the first and second person pronouns also distinguish a dual number, e.g. wit 'we two', igqara 'of you two'.

8.1 First and Second Person Pronouns
The forms of the Gothic first and second person pronouns are as follows.

 	 	1st Person	 	2nd Person
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ik	 	þu
A	 	mik	 	þuk
G	 	meina	 	þeina
D	 	mis	 	þus
 	 	 	 	 
N Du.	 	wit	 	*jut
A	 	ugkis	 	igqis
G	 	*ugkara	 	igqara
D	 	ugkis	 	igqis
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	weis	 	jus
A	 	uns, unsis	 	izwis
G	 	unsara	 	izwara
D	 	unsis, uns	 	izwis
 	 	 	 	 
Note that the first person plural A uns and D unsis often interchange with one another. The oblique forms fill the role of first and second person reflexive pronouns, so that e.g. Modern English 'I hit myself' would be more literally in Gothic 'I hit me'.

8.2 Third Person Pronouns
The third person pronoun is built from a stem i-. Unlike the first and second person pronouns, these do not serve as reflexives. Instead the forms sik, seina, sis serve as reflexives. Though the forms are singular, they serve as reflexives for all genders and numbers. Thus the reflexive of is in the accusative is sik 'himself', and likewise the reflexive of neut. N pl. ija in the accusative is sik 'themselves'. The forms of the third person pronoun and the reflexive are given below.

3rd Person	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine	 	Reflexive
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	is	 	ita	 	si	 	-
A	 	ina	 	ita	 	ija	 	sik
G	 	is	 	is	 	izōs	 	*seina
D	 	imma	 	imma	 	izái	 	sis
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	eis	 	ija	 	*ijōs	 	-
A	 	ins	 	*ija	 	ijōs	 	sik
G	 	izē	 	*izē	 	izō	 	seina
D	 	im	 	im	 	im	 	sis
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
9 Weak Verb Conjugation
Weak verbs form a category separate from strong verbs. Whereas vowel gradation (ablaut) characterizes strong verbs (cf. Modern English sing-sang-sung-song), this is not so for weak verbs. Rather the addition of a dental suffix -d- in the past tense characterizes weak verbs (cf. Modern English arrive-arrived). This dental suffix is appended to the verbal stem, before the addition of personal endings. The dental suffix is found not only in finite verbal forms, but also in the past participle (cf. Modern English 'That problem, addressed by Einstein, was the beginning of modern quantum theory').

9.1 Weak Verb Classes
Gothic has four classes of weak verbs. These classes are distinguished by the vowel which precedes the dental suffix, and the presence or absence of a nasal appended to the stem: -i-, -ō-, -ái-, -nō-. These correlate with different forms of the infinitive. The following chart lists examples of the Gothic weak verb classes.

Class	 	Preterite (1/3 Sg.)	 	Infinitive	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
i	 	nas-i-da	 	nas-jan	 	'save'
ii	 	salb-ō-da	 	salb-ōn	 	'anoint'
iii	 	hab-ái-da	 	hab-an	 	'have'
iv	 	full-nō-da	 	full-nan	 	'become full'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
9.2 Active Paradigm
The class i verb nasjan 'save' illustrates the active forms of the weak verb.

Weak Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative

Infinitive	 	nasjan	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	nasjands	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	nasiþs	 	 	 	 
All present forms derive from the infinitive, minus the -an ending. All past forms contain the dental suffix. Note that all finite preterite forms, except for the singular indicative, contain the suffix -dēd- rather than simply -d-.

9.3 Mediopassive Paradigm
As with the strong verbs, the morphological mediopassive has only present forms. The forms of nasjan 'save' illustrate the paradigm.

Weak Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive

There are no forms for the dual. Be careful to note that the -d- of the mediopassive forms is found in all verbs, strong and weak; it is not to be confused with the -d- of the weak dental preterite. The stem of these forms derives from the infinitive, as with the present active forms.

10 Particles and Conjunctions
Gothic makes use of a number of conjunctions. The simple joining of two clauses in a copulative fashion is most often accomplished with jah 'and'. This conjunction stands as the first element in its clause: warþ hūhrus abrs and gawi jáinata, jah is dugann alaþarba waírþan 'a great famine came over that people, and he started to become very poor' (Luke 15.14). jah is also found sentence-initially, continuing a previous sentence in a style parallel to Greek kaí in the New Testament. The enclitic -uh 'and' affixes to the first word of its clause: Galáiþ in praitaúria aftra Peilātus jah wōpida Iēsu qaþuh imma... 'Pilate came into the pretorium again and called Jesus and said to him...' (John 18.33). Following iþ 'but', the conjunction -uh generally attaches to the verb of the clause: iþ Iesus iddjuh miþ im 'and then Jesus went with them' (Luke 7.6). The negative copulative is nih 'and not', a combination of ni 'not' and -uh. nih generally stands at the beginning of its clause: ni maúrnáiþ sáiwalái izwarái ƕa matjáiþ jah ƕa drigkáiþ nih leika izwaramma ƕē wasjáiþ 'have no thought for your life, what you shall eat and what you shall drink; nor for your body, how you shall dress' (Matthew 6.25).

The general disjunctive particle is aíþþáu 'or'. The sequence 'either... or' is typically jabái... aíþþáu or andizuh... aíþþáu. For example, untē jabái fijáiþ áinana jah anþarana frijōþ, aíþþáu áinamma ufháuseiþ iþ anþaramma frakann 'for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other' (Matthew 6.24). In direct questions of a disjunctive nature one finds -u... þáu '(either)... or', where -u is appended to the first word of the first question: abu þus silbin þu þata qiþis, þáu anþarái þus qēþun bi mik? 'Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?' (John 18.34) Indirect disjunctive questions usually omit -u, though þáu remains to mark the second part.

There are several adversative particles: iþ, aþþan, ak, akei. These generally stand at the head of their clause: Háusidēduþ þatei qiþan ist þáim áirizam: ni maúrþrjáis; iþ saei maúrþreiþ skula waírþiþ stauái. aþþan ik qiþa izwis... 'Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you...' (Matthew 5.21-22). The particle ak generally follows a negative introduction, while akei follows a positive. For example, ni hugei hauhaba, ak ogs 'Be not highminded, but fear' (Romans 11.20); compare all binah, akei ni all daug 'All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient' (1 Cor. 10.23).

The main causal conjunctions are áuk, allis, raíhtis, untē. The particles áuk, allis, raíhtis generally occupy second position in their clause, though áuk and raíhtis may also occupy third position. For example: mahteigs áuk ist 'for [God] is able' (Romans 14.4); maht wēsi áuk 'For it might have been' (Mark 14.5). áuk may combine with raíhtis or allis: sa áuk raíhtis 'for he' (Mark 6.17); saei áuk allis 'for whoever' (Mark 9.41). By contrast, untē 'for, because, until' occupies the first position in its clause: áudagái þái hráinjahaírtans, untē þái guþ gasaiƕand 'Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God' (Matthew 5.8).

Linguistic Origins of the Goths
The linguistic remains of Gothic provide a window into the origin and history of the Gothic tribes that sometimes complements, and sometimes conflicts with, literary and archaeological records. Specifically, the words borrowed by Gothic from different languages, as well as those borrowed by other languages from Gothic, provide clues about cultural contact, and hence possible geographic location. Generally, at least in the ancient world, languages are assumed to borrow from neighboring languages. Such an assumption certainly leads to some objections, but on the whole it forms a good working hypothesis, which may lead to conclusions that can be compared with the archaeological and literary records for confirmation. If such a hypothesis fails, however, scholars must look for other means for the languages to come into contact, such as through travel along common trade routes.

The Gothic language as recorded in Wulfila's translation contains loan-words from Latin and Celtic. This could imply that either the Goths were settled close to Roman or Celtic populations, or they were in contact with them via commerce or some other means. Since the literary sources pertaining to the Goths generally speak of their origins near the Baltic Sea, scholars have primarily looked for what modes of contact the Goths may have had with these peoples from a distance. For example, if the Goths were never proximate to the Romans, the Latin loans may have come from Gothic mercenaries in Roman employ, since many of the loans have a military character: Gothic *annō from Latin annōna 'military wages'; Gothic militōn 'serve in the army' from Latin mīlēs, pl. mīlitēs 'soldier'. Such loans could could date to the period of contact between Romans and Gutones, when Drusus, son of Tiberius, convinced Catualda, chief of the Gotones, to enter the fight against the Marcomanni.

Celtic loans are likewise often of a military or political character, such as Gothic reiks: compare Gaulish -rīx, and Old Irish rī, genitive rīg. Such Celtic acculturation was possible during the Wielbark period, where the Gutones in the region belonged to the Lugian cult league. Scholars suspect the Lugians were considered Celts before the birth of Christ, but after a century had come to be considered Germanic, closely allied to the Vandals. This holdover of Celtic terms, as with Latin terms possibly borrowed during the Marcomannic wars, requires the Gutonic language to carry over into 4th century Gothic. Proximity to Celtic Lugians does not explain why these particular elements are common only to Celtic and Gothic, since other Germanic tribes were part of the Lugian league.

There are some facts (see Kortlandt, 2000) which argue against a theory of Scandinavian origin for the Goths. On the one hand, much of the source material, admittedly for Jordanes and perhaps for his predecessors Ablabius and Cassiodorus as well, is in the form of oral traditions, the interpretation of which may change within a culture as the culture itself changes. On the other hand, there are some problems with the notion of large-scale migration from the Baltic to the Black Sea. One problem is that the region between the point of origin and the destination is believed to be the homeland of the Slavs, who seem not to have moved until the advent of the Huns. This seems unlikely if there was a mass migration of Goths through the territory. (It is subject to the same argument that supposes the advent of the Huns is what caused the Goths to press into Roman territory.) In addition, the general trend of migration near the borderland of the steppes was westward from poorer lowland to richer upland, not eastward. Another typical trend of the period is that of migration toward more civilized areas rather than away from them, hence in this case toward the Roman Empire's nearest border, the Danube -- a direction in which the Slavs in fact moved, a few centuries later.

Therefore a different proposal arises (Kortlandt, 2000), namely that the Gutones moved south early, toward Italy and the Roman Empire, until they came to the Danube. There they adopted the speech of Alemannic tribes that had previously migrated to the region from the west, and whose speech would already be colored by Roman contact. They were prevented from entering Roman territory, and joined forces with other Germanic tribes in Lower Austria. This mingling of the Gutones with other Germanic tribes in the region resulted in the Gothic ethnogenesis.

One simple fact supporting such a theory is the panoply of names applied to the Goths in the course of their migrations, none of which is actually 'Goth' until a fairly late date. It seems especially likely that the Gothic tribe through the 3rd and 4th centuries was composed of several fluid factions. To add to such literary observations, there is linguistic data as well that may support a Gothic ethnogenesis in southern Germany.

In particular, some of the linguistic features deemed most conservative in Gothic, such as the reduplicated suffix in the past plural of weak verbs, may in fact be innovations. If the origin of the weak verbs is the dh-determinative, then the reduplication found in Gothic may not be an archaic holdover, but rather a form based on analogy with such forms as the preterite of *dhē in Old High German.

In reference to Latin, the fact that the Latin suffix -ārius is productive in the Gothic words such as bōkareis 'scribe', láisareis 'teacher', liuþareis 'singer', mōtareis 'toll-taker', sōkareis 'disputer', may argue for closer contact than merely mercenary jargon. Other cultural loans from Latin, lacking military character, are common, e.g. aurali 'napkin' < Lat. ōrārium; kubitus 'reclining (company) at a table' < Lat. cubitus; aurti-gards, with first element from Latin hortus; mēs < Vulgar Latin mēsa < Latin mēnsa. The word lukarn 'lamp' is an early borrowing from Latin; aket, akeit 'vinegar', a borrowing from Latin acētum, because of non-palatalized c-, may have been borrowed in 1st-3rd centuries, before migration to Russia. Also borrowed from Latin were Kreks 'Greek' and marikreitum 'pearls', showing the change of Latin g to Gmc k, interesting in light of the fact that the Alemannic dialects lack voiced obstruents. In fact, Greek words often appear in Latinized forms, e.g. aípistula 'letter', aíwaggeljō 'gospel', paúrpura 'purple', diabulus 'devil'. Greek words with accented -í- often show -j-, i.e. no accent, in Gothic: aikklesjō 'congregation', skaúrpjōnō 'of scorpions'. In general Greek o is represented by Gothic ō, as in Gothic Aírmōgaínēs corresponding to Greek Ermogénēs. However the fact that Greek o-stems are inflected as Gothic u-stems in the singular, and as i-stems in the plural, may be a result of Latin transmission: Iudaius, -áus sg.; Iudaieis, ē pl.

Thus there may have been a protracted period of close contact between the Goths and Romans well before Wulifila's translation, and the Celtic loans need not have come from Lugians in the north, but possibly from the Bastarni (if they were in fact Celts) in the Balkans. Certain words adopted from Latin into Gothic also show devoicing characteristic of Alemannic dialects, which suggests that the Goths may have been in close proximity to southern Germanic dialects for an extended period. It seems that the linguistic picture of Gothic origins is as heterogeneous as that derived from the literary and archaeological remains.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is from John 6.1-14, in which Jesus provides enough bread and fish to feed the multitude. The Gothic translation shows some noteworthy linguistic features. In 6.6, the phrase habáida táujan '(what) he would do' provides an example of a compound future tense, with a sense of necessity given by haban. The following verse, John 6.7, has the phrase twáim hundam skattē hláibōs ni ganōhái sind, literally 'loaves at (the price) two hundred of coins are not enough'. This shows the common use of the genitive with a numeral, analogous to Modern English 'a little bit of money'; likewise it illustrates the use of an instrumental dative with genōhs to denote price. John 6.8 contains the genitive Paítráus. Greek loan words in -os tend to be declined according to the Gothic u-declension.

We find in verse 6.11 some insight into the original Greek source of the Gothic translation. As with the Old English translation and Wycliffe's translation of 1389, Gothic lacks the phrase 'to the disciples, and the disciples'. This suggests that the Gothic translator worked with a manuscript different from that used to prepare the King James Version, but belonging to the same family as that of earlier English translations.

Note also the syntax of the word wáihts in John 6.12 : wáihtái ni fraqistnái 'that nothing be lost'. Here the dative of wáihts (with negative ni) is used with an impersonal verb, giving more literally '(that) it be lost for (no)thing' or 'at (no)thing', equivalent to '(that) it be lost in no way, in no respect'. The syntax of John 6.14 is similarly noteworthy: gasaíƕandans þōei gatawida táikn Iēsus, literally 'seeing the-which-(Jesus)-did miracle', where the relative clause has been pulled to the front, before its actual antecedent. This fronting of the relative clause is common to many of the Indo-European languages, including Sanskrit and even its modern daughters, such as Hindi.

Translation
From the King James version:
6:1 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. 3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? 6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, 9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many? 10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 12 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. 13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
Grammar
11 Strong Declension
Not all nominal stems end in a vowel. Several end in consonants. The type most common in Gothic, the n-stems, will be discussed in a subsequent lesson. The consonant stems in the present section are fewer in number, but generally denote important concepts, the names for which are undoubtedly survivals from a very archaic stage of the language.

11.1 r-Stems
The r-stem nouns form a small but important fraction of the Gothic vocabulary. All r-stems in Gothic are inherited directly from Proto-Indo-European. The nouns fadar 'father', brōþar 'brother', daúhtar 'daughter', and swistar 'sister' illustrate the declension. All Gothic r-stems denote familial relation, with the grammatical gender following the natural gender.

r-Stem	 	Masculine	 	 	 	Feminine	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	brōþar-	 	fadar-	 	daúhtar-	 	swistar-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	brōþar	 	 	 	daúhtar	 	swistar
A, V	 	brōþar	 	fadar (V)	 	daúhtar	 	swistar
G	 	brōþrs	 	 	 	daúhtrs	 	swistrs
D	 	brōþr	 	 	 	daúhtr	 	swistr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	brōþrjus	 	 	 	daúhtrjus	 	swistrjus
A	 	brōþruns	 	 	 	daúhtruns	 	swistruns
G	 	brōþrē	 	 	 	daúhtrē	 	swistrē
D	 	brōþrum	 	 	 	daúhtrum	 	swistrum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The word fadar occurs only once in the vocative, the word atta 'father' being used elsewhere. The declensions of the nouns are the same, being reproduced for the sake of completeness. The nominative plural ending -jus comes by analogy with sunjus, the r-stems already having accusative and dative plurals identical to the u-stems (see Section 7.2).

11.2 nd-Stems
The nd-stems derive from an original present participle formation, but were frozen as substantives. These nouns are generally masculine. The nouns frijōnds 'friend', fijands 'enemy', nasjands 'savior' illustrate the declension.

nd-Stem	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	frijōnd-	 	fijand-	 	nasjand-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	frijōnds	 	fijands	 	nasjands
A, V	 	frijōnd	 	fijand	 	nasjand
G	 	frijōndis	 	fijandis	 	nasjandis
D	 	frijōnd	 	*fijand	 	nasjand
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	frijōnds	 	fijands	 	nasjands
A	 	frijōnds	 	fijands	 	nasjands
G	 	frijōndē	 	fijandē	 	nasjandē
D	 	frijōndam	 	fijandam	 	nasjandam
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note the identical forms of the nominative singular and nominative and accusative plural. The following nouns decline similarly: allwaldands 'the Almighty'; bisitands 'neighbor'; dáupjands 'baptizer, baptist'; fráujinōnds 'ruler'; fraweitands 'avenger'; gibands 'giver'; mērjands 'proclaimer'; midumōnds 'mediator'; talzjands 'teacher'.

11.3 Other Consonant Stems
Some noun stems end in consonants different from those above. Their declensions are not prevalent enough to warrant separate discussion, so they are collected below. The nouns mēnōþs 'month', reiks 'ruler' are masculine; baúrgs 'city', mitaþs 'measure', nahts 'night' are feminine; fōn 'fire' is neuter. Their forms are given below.

Cons. Stems	 	Masculine	 	 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	mēnōþ-	 	reik-	 	baúrg-	 	mitaþ-	 	naht-	 	fōn-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	mēnōþs	 	reiks	 	baúrgs	 	mitaþs	 	nahts	 	fōn
A, V	 	*mēnōþ	 	*reik	 	baúrg	 	mitaþ	 	naht	 	fōn
G	 	*mēnōþs?	 	reikis	 	baúrgs	 	mitads	 	nahts	 	funins
D	 	mēnōþ	 	reik	 	baúrg	 	mitaþ	 	naht	 	funin
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	*mēnōþs	 	reiks	 	baúrgs	 	mitaþs	 	nahts	 	 
A	 	mēnōþs	 	reiks	 	baúrgs	 	mitaþs	 	nahts	 	 
G	 	*mēnōþē	 	reikē	 	baúrgē	 	mitaþē	 	nahtē	 	 
D	 	mēnōþum	 	reikam	 	baúrgim	 	mitaþim	 	nahtam	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note: the feminine genitive and dative plurals were formed by analogy with i-stems, except the dative plural nahtam which parallels dagam. Note also the -d- in the genitive singular of mitaþs. The only neuter noun of this type is fōn, with no plural forms attested.

12 Demonstratives and the Definite Article
In comparison to other Germanic languages, Gothic has a fairly reduced set of demonstratives. The demonstratives could generally be used as deictic adjectives, or in a substantival role as demonstrative pronouns.

The most common demonstrative is sa, þata, sō. As adjective, it may point to something relatively close ('this') or relatively distant ('that') from the perspective of the speaker. In a less marked sense, the demonstrative is used as a simple definite article 'the'. As pronouns, the same forms may translate as 'this one' or 'that one'. The forms are as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sa	 	þata	 	sō
A	 	þana	 	þata	 	sō
G	 	þis	 	þis	 	þizōs
D	 	þamma	 	þamma	 	þizái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þái	 	þō	 	þōs
A	 	þans	 	þō	 	þōs
G	 	þizē	 	þizē	 	þizō
D	 	þáim	 	þáim	 	þáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The final a of þata is often elided before ist: þat' ist. A neuter instrumental singular is preserved in certain phrases and as part of some conjunctions: ni þē haldis 'none the more'; bi-þē 'while'; jaþ-þē 'and if'; du-þē 'therefore'; þē-ei 'that'. A locative or instumental form survives as the relative particle þei 'that'.

The emphatic demonstrative sah, þatuh, þōh 'that, that in particular, that especially' is formed by adding the enclitic -uh to the forms of sa, þata, sō. This demonstrative expresses not only emphasis, but contrast as well. The attested forms are as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sah	 	þatuh	 	sōh
A	 	þanuh	 	þatuh	 	 
G	 	þizuh	 	þizuh	 	 
D	 	þammuh	 	þammuh	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þáih	 	 	 	 
A	 	þanzuh	 	þōh	 	 
G	 	 	 	 	 	 
D	 	 	 	þáimuh	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
When the simple pronoun ends in -a, the -a is elided before the following -u, except in the nominative singular masculine (that is, weakly stressed -a is lost). When the simple pronoun ends in a long vowel or diphthong, the following -u is elided. Final -s changes to -z before -uh. The instrumental occurs in the adverb bi-þēh 'after that, then afterward'.

There are remnants of a demonstrative built to the stem hi-. These are confined, for the most part, to a small number of temporal adverbial phrases: himma daga 'on this day, today'; und hina daga 'to this day'; fram himma 'henceforth'; und hita (nu) 'till now, hitherto'; also hidrē 'to here'.

The demonstrative jáins 'that, that there, yon' declines as a strong adjective (the nom. and acc. pl. neut. is always jáinata). The demonstratives silba 'self' and sama 'same' decline as weak adjectives.

13 Adjectives: Strong Declension
Adjectives employ two different sets of endings, strong and weak. These names only reflect a binary system, equivalent to Type A and Type B, respectively; the adjectives 'strong' and 'weak' have no other connotations. Whereas a given noun is either strong (inherently) or weak (inherently) but not both, a given adjective by contrast may employ either strong or weak endings as the context requires. There is thus a difference in use and connotation between strong adjectival endings and their weak counterparts. The term 'strong adjective' is generally used as a shorthand for 'adjective with strong endings'; similarly 'weak adjective' means 'adjective with weak endings'. Using this terminology, the difference in usage is the following: strong adjectives are indefinite, weak adjectives are definite.

13.1 a/ja/wa-Stems
The strong adjective endings are a mixture of the endings of strong nouns like dags, waúrd, giba (cf. Section 3) and of pronouns (cf. Sections 8.2 and 12). The adjective blinds 'blind' illustrates the declension of a-stem adjectives. Pronominal endings are italicized.

Strong a-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	blinds	 	blind, blindata	 	blinda
A	 	blindana	 	blind, blindata	 	blinda
G	 	blindis	 	blindis	 	blindáizōs
D	 	blindamma	 	blindamma	 	blindái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	blindái	 	blinda	 	blindōs
A	 	blindans	 	blinda	 	blindōs
G	 	blindáizē	 	blindáizē	 	blindáizō
D	 	blindáim	 	blindáim	 	blindáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The ja-stem adjectives divide into two groups: (1) those with short radical syllable, and those whose stems end in a vowel; (2) those with a long radical syllable. The difference between the two only appears in the singular forms. The adjective midjis 'middle' illustrates the endings of group (1).

Strong ja-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
Group (1)	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	midjis	 	*midi, midjata	 	midja
A	 	midjana	 	*midi, midjata	 	midja
G	 	midjis	 	midjis	 	midjáizōs
D	 	midjamma	 	midjamma	 	midjái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	midjái	 	midja	 	midjōs
A	 	midjans	 	midja	 	midjōs
G	 	midjáizē	 	midjáizē	 	midjáizō
D	 	midjáim	 	midjáim	 	midjáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The adjective wilþeis 'wild' serves to illustrate the endings of group (2). The forms which differ from those of Group (1) are in boldface.

Strong ja-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
Group (2)	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	wilþeis	 	wilþi, wilþjata	 	wilþi
A	 	wilþjana	 	wilþi, wilþjata	 	wilþja
G	 	*wilþeis	 	*wilþeis, -jis?	 	wilþáizōs
D	 	wilþjamma	 	wilþjamma	 	wilþjái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	wilþái	 	wilþja	 	wilþjōs
A	 	wilþjans	 	wilþja	 	wilþjōs
G	 	wilþjáizē	 	wilþjáizē	 	wilþjáizō
D	 	wilþjáim	 	wilþjáim	 	wilþjáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The wa-stem adjectives are sparsely attested. The adjective triggws 'true' serves to illustrate the attested forms.

Strong wa-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	triggws	 	triggw

D	 	*triggwáim	 	*triggwáim	 	triggwáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Only a handful of wa-stem adjectives remain in the surviving Gothic texts. The adjective lasiws 'weak' occurs only in the nominative singular maculine. Other wa-stems such as *qius 'alive', *fáus 'little', *usskáus 'vigilant' do not occur in the nominative singular masculine at all.

13.2 i-Stems
The strong forms of the i-stem adjectives differ from the ja-stem forms only in the nominative singular of all genders, the accusative singular neuter, and the genitive singular masculine and neuter. The adjective hráins 'clean' serves to illustrate the paradigm. The forms differing from the ja-stems are in boldface.

Strong i-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hráins	 	hráin	 	hráins
A	 	hráinjana	 	hráin	 	hráinja

A	 	hráinjans	 	hráinja	 	hráinjōs
G	 	hráinjáizē	 	hráinjáizē	 	hráinjáizō
D	 	hráinjáim	 	hráinjáim	 	hráinjáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The following adjectives decline similarly: analáugns 'hidden'; anasiuns 'visible'; andanēms 'pleasant'; áuþs 'desert'; brūks 'useful'; gafáurs 'well-behaved'; gamáins 'common'; sēls 'kind'; skáuns 'beautiful'; skeirs 'clear'; suts 'sweet'.

13.3 u-Stems
The u-stem adjectives also employ for the most part the endings of the ja-stem declension. Only the nominative singular of all genders and the accusative singular neuter show different forms, following the declensions of sunus 'son', feminine handus 'hand', and neuter faíhu 'cattle' (see Section 7.2). Though the genitive singular likely followed the form of u-stem nouns, no instances survive; likewise no dative singular forms are attested, nor nominative and accusative plural neuter. The adjective hardus 'hard' serves to illustrate the paradigm. Forms differing from the ja-stems are boldface.

Strong u-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hardus	 	hardu, hardjata	 	hardus
A	 	hardjana	 	hardu, hardjata	 	hardja
G	 	 	 	 	 	 
D	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	hardjái	 	 	 	hardjōs
A	 	hardjans	 	 	 	hardjōs
G	 	hardjáizē	 	hardjáizē	 	hardjáizō
D	 	hardjáim	 	hardjáim	 	hardjáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The following adjectives decline similarly: aggwus 'narrow'; aglus 'difficult'; hnasqus 'soft'; kaúrus 'heavy'; manwus 'ready'; qaírrus 'gentle'; seiþus 'late'; tulgus 'steadfast'; twalibwintrus 'twelve years old'; þaúrsus 'withered'; þlaqus 'soft'.

13.4 Possessive Adjectives
The possessive adjectives decline exclusively as strong adjectives (there are no weak forms of possessives). These forms are built from the genitive forms of the respective pronouns, with the addition of adjectival endings, e.g. ik 'I', with G sg. meina, gives adjectival *meina-s > meins 'my' (N. sg. masc.). The forms of meins 'my, mine' serve to illustrate the paradigm.

Possessive	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	meins	 	mein, meinata	 	meina
A	 	meinana	 	mein, meinata	 	meina
G	 	meinis	 	meinis	 	meináizōs
D	 	meinamma	 	meinamma	 	meinái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	meinái	 	meina	 	meinōs
A	 	meinans	 	meina	 	meinōs
G	 	meináizē	 	meináizē	 	meináizō
D	 	meináim	 	meináim	 	meináim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The second person builds a possessive adjective þeins, and the reflexive pronoun has possessive *seins (as it points back to the subject of the clause, only oblique forms occur). The dual and plural forms of the personal pronouns also build possessives:

Person	 	Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	meina-	 	meins	 	mein, meinata	 	meina
2	 	þeina-	 	þeins	 	þein, þeinata	 	þeina
refl. (Acc.)	 	seina-	 	seinana	 	sein, seinata	 	seina
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Du.	 	*ugkara-	 	ugkar	 	ugkar	 	ugkara
2	 	igqara-	 	igqar	 	igqar	 	igqara
-	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	unsara-	 	unsar	 	unsar	 	unsara
2	 	izwara-	 	izwar	 	izwar	 	izwara
-	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The reflexive possessive adjective *seins serves as a reflexive for any number, just like the pronoun itself. The dual possessive *unqar 'of us two' does not occur. Note that final -s (-z) drops after a short vowel followed by consonantal -r (cf. Section 6.2.2), hence the nominative forms of the dual and plural possessives lack final -s. The neuter nominative and accusative singular of the dual and plural possessives do not show the ending -ata. In all other forms, *ugkara- 'of us two', igqara- 'of you two', unsara- 'of us (all), our, ours' and izwara- 'of you (all), your, yours' follow the paradigm of meins.

The third person pronouns have no corresponding possessive adjectives, using simply the genitive forms of the personal pronoun (singular is, is, izōs; plural izē, *izē, izō) or of the demonstrative pronoun (singular þis, þis, þizōs; plural þizē, þizē, þizō).

14 Past Participle
Like Modern English, Gothic has a past participle whose formation depends on whether the verb is strong or weak. Unlike, e.g., classical Greek or Sanskrit, which have morphologically distinct past active and past passive participles, Gothic makes no morphological distinction between active and passive participles. One and the same formation generally has different interpretations based on the transitivity of the root: the past participle of transitive verbs is construed as passive (e.g. 'having been eaten'), while the past participle of intransitive verbs is construed as active (e.g. 'having gone').

14.1 Formation
The formation of past participles in Gothic parallels that of Modern English, as well as the other Germanic languages. There are two types of past participle, reflecting the distinction between strong and weak verbs. Note there is no correlation between the terms 'strong' and 'weak' as applied to verbs, and the same terms as applied to adjective endings. A strong verb forms a past participle, which may be declined as either a strong or a weak adjective; likewise a weak verb's past participle may take either weak or strong adjectival endings. The weak adjective endings are treated in Section 17.1.

Strong verbs form the past participle by adding the suffix -an to the verbal stem, which in general displays ablaut. Compare Modern English eat-en. Strong a-stem or weak adjective endings are then added to the -an suffix. Because of the relative unpredictability of ablaut, the past participle is typically given as one of the principal parts. For example, the strong class IVa verb qiman 'come' has principal parts qiman, qam, qēmun, qumans. The past participle stem is thus quman-. The nominative singular forms for strong and weak declension of quman- are as follows.

Strong Vb. PPl.	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	qumans	 	quman, qumanata	 	qumana
Weak	 	qumana	 	qumanō	 	qumanō
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Weak verbs form the past participle by means of a dental suffix -þ, as one finds in e.g. Modern English ask-ed. This is added to the stem, sometimes with an intervening vowel, and adjective endings are added to this. The intervening vowel depends on weak verb class. Consider the following exemplars.

Class	 	Past Ptcpl. (Str. N Sg. Masc.)	 	Infinitive	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
i	 	nas-i-þs	 	nas-jan	 	'save'
ii	 	salb-ō-þs	 	salb-ōn	 	'anoint'
iii	 	hab-ái-þs	 	hab-an	 	'have'
iv	 	 	 	full-nan	 	'become full'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
No verbs of the weak class iv leave any past participle forms in the records. Though it is often remarked in grammars that this class contains only intransitive verbs, this does not explain a priori the absence of such participles, as the example qumans shows above (see also þaúrsjan 'thirst' below). A small number of verbs of the weak class i add the dental suffix with no intervening vowel. The most common are listed below.

Infinitive	 	Meaning	 	Preterite (1/3 Sg.)	 	Past Ptcpl. (Str. N Sg. Masc.)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
briggan	 	'bring'	 	brāhta	 	*brāhts
brūkjan	 	'use'	 	brūhta	 	*brūhts
bugjan	 	'buy'	 	baúhta	 	baúhts
þagkjan	 	'think'	 	þāhta	 	þāhts
þugkjan	 	'seem'	 	þūhta	 	þūhts
waúrkjan	 	'work'	 	waúrhta	 	waúrhts
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
As with the participles of strong verbs, those of weak verbs decline as either strong a-stem or weak adjectives as the context demands. The nominative singular forms for strong and weak declension of quman- are as follows.

Weak Vb. PPl.	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	nasiþs	 	nasiþ, nasidata	 	nasida
Weak	 	nasida	 	nasidō	 	nasidō
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note the the change of -þ- to -d- between vowels.

14.2 Past Participle Usage
As mentioned above, the past participle of transitive verbs is construed as passive in sense; the past participle of intransitive verbs is construed as active. For example, qiman 'to come' (intransitive) vs. qumans 'come' (active -- cf. Shakespearean 'I am come' = 'I have arrived'), but baíran 'to bear' (transitive) vs. baúrans 'borne' (passive); likewise nasjan 'to save' (transitive) vs. nasiþs 'saved' (passive), but þaúrsjan 'thirst' (intransitive) vs. af-þaúrsiþs '(having) thirsted, thirsty' (active). Even this distinction, though, is not absolute. For example, the transitive verb drigkan 'to drink' has a past participle with active sense, drunkans 'having drunk', hence simply 'drunk': drunkans ist in Col. 11.21 translates Greek methúei 'is intoxicated'.

The past participle frequently appears in the dative in an absolute contruction, much as Old Church Slavonic dative, Latin ablative, Greek genitive, and Sanskrit locative. Such constructions convey an event grammatically separate (hence 'absolute') from the main clause. For example, jah usleiþandin Iēsua in skipa, gaqēmun sik manageins filu du imma 'and Jesus having passed over in the ship, there came together to him a great multitude'; dalaþ þan atgaggandin imma af faírgunja, láistidēdun afar imma iumjōns managōs 'then having come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed after him'. The nominative is found on rare occasions in such absolute constructions: waúrþans dags gatils '(and) a fitting day being come'.

The past participle is sometimes used with the suppletive verb wisan 'to be' or with waírþan 'to become' to form a periphrastic passive. For example, miþþanei wrohiþs was 'when he was accused' (Matthew 27.12); afar þatei atgibans warþ Iohannes 'after that John was put...' (Mark 1.14); skal sunus mans uskusans waírþan 'the son of man shall be rejected' (Mark 8.31).

15 Prepositions
Each Gothic preposition governs objects in one or more of the oblique cases. The case governed is a property of the preposition: each preposition governs only a specific case or cases. If a preposition governs more than one case, its meaning may or may not change depending on the case employed. Generally the genitive is used after a preposition to denote source, cause, or instrument. The dative commonly denotes position in space or time without motion, or it may denote source, cause, or instrument. The accusative is used after a preposition to denote motion to or through space or time, or to denote a point of time within a certain period, opposition, or correspondence. A few adverbs have prepositional force when combined with a noun in the genitive. The following chart lists the primary Gothic prepositions, together with the cases they govern and the associated meanings.

Lesson 4
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
The Earliest Raids of the Goths
The Goths began their famous foray into the history books in the third century AD, when they launched the first attack of what would become in the eyes of contemporaries a barbarian ravaging and pillaging machine. Their first entry into the literary records comes with their attacks on the Roman empire. At the time, the most exposed province was Transylvanian Dacia; but this region was protected by the Carpathian mountains, hence attacks generally came from south of the range across the lower reaches of the Danube or through a stretch of land connecting the so-called Dacian Salient to the Roman-occupied regions of the Balkans. The first known attack was the sack of Histria at the mouth of the Danube in 238. This was followed some 10 years later by other land attacks: Marcianople, a city inland from the westernmost extent of the Black Sea, was sacked in 249 by a Gothic group led by Argaith and Guntheric; in 250 Cniva crossed the Danube at Oescus and captured Philippopolis, wintered his army, and then in 251 defeated Roman forces and killed the emperor Decius at Abrittus.

The Goths then changed tactics and led sea-borne attacks via the Black Sea, the first series coming sometime around 255-257. The first attack fell on Pityus, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, but was unsuccessful. In the next attack a year later, the 'Boranoi' -- a group possibly including the Goths -- ravaged Pityus, Trapezus, and a large part of the Pontus, the region of Asia Minor bordering the Black Sea in the southeasternmost reaches. A year later the Goths explicitly attacked the cities Apamea, Chalcedon, Nicaea, Nicomedia, Prusa, as well as the surrounding areas of Bithynia and Propontis, lying near the southwesternmost reaches of the Black Sea.

The next attacks came another 10 years later. In 268 the Goths and other tribes formed a large fleet which headed across the Black Sea to the south, unsuccessfully attacking Tomi and Marcianople, and subsequently (also unsuccessfully) Cyzicus and Byzantium. They pushed through the Dardanelles into the Aegean and dispersed in three forces: (1) composed of Heruli attacking the northern Balkans near Thessalonica -- subsequently defeated by Emperor Gallienus in 268; (2) composed of Goths and Heruli, attacking Attica -- after pushing north over land they were defeated by Claudius at Naissus in 270; (3) probably led by the Gothic chieftains Respa, Thuruar, and Veduc, and attacking Asia Minor, then Rhodes and Cyprus, then Side and Ilium and Ephesus, destroying the temple of Diana. This third group was pushed back to the Black Sea in 269. After this foray into the Mediterranean, there were no other attacks through the Dardanelles.

The Goths returned to land battles in an attack across the Danube in 270 against Anchialus and Nicopolis. This was followed by a Roman attack across Danube in 271, defeating the Gothic king Cannabaudes. The Goths attacked the Pontus again in 276-277, pushing farther inland to Galatia and Cilicia.

The impact of these waves of Gothic attacks is clearly felt in the Canonical Letter of Gregory Thaumaturgus, bishop of Neocaesarea (modern Niksar) in the Pontus region of Asia Minor. His episcopate fell during the emperor Decius's persecution of Christians, which started c. 250 AD. He may have lived until the reign of Aurelian (270-275 AD). The letter is a response to a neighboring bishop's questions concerning the conduct of Roman soldiers during and after the most recent period of Gothic raids in the Pontus (translated in Heather and Matthews, 1991):

Canon 5	 	Others delude themselves by keeping the property of others which they have found, in place of their own which they have lost, in order that, since the Boranoi and Goths worked on them deeds of war, so they may become Boranoi and Goths to others. I have therefore sent my brother... [that he may] advise you whose accusations you should accept....
Canon 6	 	Concerning those who forcibly detain captives (who have escaped) from barbarians.... Send men out into the countryside, lest divine thunderbolts descend upon those who perpetrate such wickedness!
Canon 7	 	... As for those who have been enrolled among the barbarians and followed after them as prisoners, forgetting that they were men of Pontus, and Christians, and have become so thoroughly barbarised as even to put to death men of their own race by the gibbet or noose, and to point out roads and houses to the barbarians, who were ignorant of them; you must debar them even from the ranks of Hearers, until a common decision is reached about them by the assembly of saints, with the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
Canon 8	 	... As for those who brought themselves to attack the houses of others, if they are convicted after accusation, let them not be fit even to be Hearers. If however they confess their own guilt and make restitution, they are to prostrate themselves among the ranks of the penitent.
It thus seems clear that the raiding parties, though in origin homogeneous groups of Goths or other individual tribes, were soon augmented by other enterprizing -- or coerced -- individuals within the lands they attacked. The attacks themselves thus only left a transitory material calamity. More long-term problems were felt when the raids had ceased, and there arose the issues of readmitting offenders and presumed offenders into the societies to which they formerly belonged.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is Luke 4.1-13, in which Jesus is tempted by Satan. In the first verse, we find the collocation gawandida sik 'returned', encountered in several places in other readings. This phrase is more literally 'brought himself back'. Though Gothic has a functioning morphological mediopassive which might, on Indo-European historical grounds, serve to connote exactly the meaning reached here, Gothic is already very close to other Germanic languages in the frequent use of such periphrastic reflexive collocations to render transitive verbs intransitive.

In Luke 4.3 we find a nominative form sunáus instead of the proper nominative sunus 'son'; a similar form diabuláus replaces the proper nominative diabulus in Luke 4.5. It is likely that, shortly after the time of Wulfila (if not before), the diphthong áu was monophthongized and subsequently indistinguishable from u, leading to occasional scribal confusion. Similar phonetically derived scribal confusion occurs in Luke 4.4: we find the forms hláib and libáid, which do not show the expected devoicing of final -b and -d to -f and -þ, respectively.

Note also the construction in Luke 4.3: qiþ þamma stáina ei waírþái hláibs 'command this stone that it be made bread'. This is an example of the particle ei used to introduce an indirect command. The particle ei was originally a general relative marker, setting off an entire phrase as dependent on surrounding material. Only later did this particle become attached to demonstrative pronouns to form relative pronouns, such as saei. Some of these subsequently became subordinate conjunctions, e.g. þatei. Gothic may also use prepositional constructions for subordinate clauses, such as Luke 4.10: du gafastan '(in order) to support' shows the frequent use in Gothic of the preposition du with the infinitive in purpose constructions.

The phrase in Luke 4.7, in andwaírþja meinamma 'in my presence', translates the Greek enōpion emou, which is not explicit in the King James Version. The English phrase 'Get thee behind me, Satan' in Luke 4.8 does not appear in the Gothic, an indication that the Gothic translation was made from a different manuscript than the King James Version.

Translation
From the King James version:
4:1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. 3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: 11 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.
Grammar
16 Weak Nominal Declension
The weak declension of nouns is nothing more than n-stem nominal formation. In principle it is no different from the formation of r-stems or nd-stems: the affix -Vn- intercedes between nominal root and endings, where V is some vowel. Just as brōþar 'brother' is inherently an r-stem noun (employing no other formations), likewise weak nouns are inherently weak, i.e. only n-stem. While adjectives may employ strong or weak declension (see Sections 13 and 17) according to contextual demands, a given noun by contrast employs only one declension at all times: a weak noun always declines weak, a strong noun always strong.

16.1 an/jan/wan-Stems
The an/jan/wan-stem nouns are generally masculine or neuter. Nouns with the j- or w-augment take the same endings as those without. The nouns atta 'father', arbja 'heir', and gawaúrstwa 'fellow-worker' -- respectively an-, jan-, and wan-stems -- serve to illustrate the masculine forms. The nouns haírtō 'heart', áugō 'eye', and sigljō 'seal' -- respectively an-, an-, and jan-stems -- serve to illustrate the neuter forms.

Weak an-Stem	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	Neuter	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	attan-	 	arbjan-	 	gawaúrstwan-	 	haírtan-	 	áugan-	 	sigljan-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	atta	 	arbja	 	gawaúrstwa	 	haírtō	 	áugō	 	sigljō
A	 	attan	 	arbjan	 	gawaúrstwan	 	haírtō	 	áugō	 	sigljō
G	 	attins	 	arbjins	 	gawaúrstwins	 	haírtins	 	áugins	 	*sigljins
D	 	attin	 	arbjin	 	gawaúrstwin	 	haírtin	 	áugin	 	*sigljin
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	attans	 	arbjans	 	gawaúrstwans	 	haírtōna	 	áugōna	 	*sigljōna
A	 	attans	 	arbjans	 	gawaúrstwans	 	haírtōna	 	áugōna	 	*sigljōna
G	 	attanē	 	arbjanē	 	gawaúrstwanē	 	haírtanē	 	áuganē	 	*sigljanē
D	 	attam	 	arbjam	 	gawaúrstwam	 	haírtam	 	áugam	 	*sigljam
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note that the dative plural is built by analogy to a-stem nouns, without the intervening Vn-affix. The nouns aba (masc.) 'man, husband'; aúhsa (masc.) 'ox'; namō (neut.) 'name'; and watō (neut.) 'water' have different forms in the plural. These are boldfaced in the chart below. The masculine noun manna 'man' generalized the zero-grade of the n-stem formation (-n- rather than -Vn-), yielding a peculiar declension.

Weak an-Stem	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	Neuter	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	ab(a)n-	 	aúhs(a)n-	 	man(a)n-	 	nam(a)n-	 	wat(a)n-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	aba	 	aúhsa	 	manna	 	namō	 	watō
A	 	aban	 	aúhsan	 	mannan	 	namō	 	watō
G	 	abins	 	aúhsins	 	mans	 	namins	 	watins
D	 	abin	 	aúhsin	 	mann	 	namin	 	watin
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	abans	 	aúhsans	 	mans, mannans	 	namna	 	watōna
A	 	abans	 	aúhsans	 	mans, mannans	 	namna	 	watōna
G	 	abnē	 	aúhsnē	 	mannē	 	namnē	 	watanē
D	 	abnam	 	aúhsam	 	mannam	 	namnam	 	watnam
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
For the zero-grade forms of manna, compare Latin declension: nom. sg. carō 'flesh' with acc. carnem, as opposed to nom. sg. homō 'man' with acc. hominem.

16.2 ōn/jōn/wōn-Stems
The ōn/jōn/wōn-stem nouns are generally feminine. Nouns with the j- or w-augment take the same endings as those without. The nouns tuggō 'tongue', arbjō 'heiress', and ūhtwō 'early morning' -- respectively ōn-, jōn-, and wōn-stems -- serve to illustrate the forms.

Weak ōn-Stem	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	tuggōn-	 	arbjōn-	 	ūhtwōn-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	tuggō	 	arbjō	 	ūhtwō
A	 	tuggōn	 	arbjōn	 	ūhtwōn
G	 	tuggōns	 	arbjōns	 	ūhtwōns
D	 	tuggōn	 	arbjōn	 	ūhtwōn
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	tuggōns	 	arbjōns	 	ūhtwōns
A	 	tuggōns	 	arbjōns	 	ūhtwōns
G	 	tuggōnō	 	arbjōnō	 	ūhtwōnō
D	 	tuggōm	 	arbjōm	 	ūhtwōm
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The vowel ō has generalized throughout the declension, so that the dative, though characteristically lacking any sign of the n-stem, still maintains the vowel.

16.3 īn-Stems
The īn-stem nouns (recall [ī] is spelled ei in Gothic) are generally feminine. These nouns derive for the most part from adjectives, forming the associated abstract noun. The nouns managei 'multitude', áiþei 'mother', and frōdei 'understanding' serve to illustrate the forms.

Weak īn-Stem	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	managein-	 	áiþein-	 	frōdein-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	managei	 	áiþei	 	frōdei
A	 	managein	 	áiþein	 	frōdein
G	 	manageins	 	áiþeins	 	frōdeins
D	 	managein	 	áiþein	 	frōdein
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	manageins	 	áiþeins	 	frōdeins
A	 	manageins	 	áiþeins	 	frōdeins
G	 	manageinō	 	áiþeinō	 	frōdeinō
D	 	manageim	 	áiþeim	 	frōdeim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The formation is similar to the declension of ōn-stems. The vowel ī has generalized throughout the declension, so that the dative maintains the vowel while losing the n.

17 Adjectives: Weak Declension
Adjectives decline according to weak or strong paradigms based on the requirements of context (cf. Section 13 on strong adjective declension). The choice is one of specificity: Gothic employs weak adjective forms to modify a definite noun, and strong forms to modify an indefinite noun. For example, ahma sa weiha 'the holy ghost' and þái ana aírþái þizái gōdōn saianans 'they that are sown on the good ground' (Mark 4.20). For comparison, weihs ahma would be 'a holy spirit', ana gōdái aírþái 'on (some) good ground', saianái 'sown'. Weak endings are generally used for nominalized adjectives: unkarjans 'careless (ones)'. Compare weihs 'holy' (strong) to weiha 'priest' (weak), literally '(the) holy one'. From a morphological point of view, weak adjective endings are simply n-stem endings. In this way, their use for definite reference parallels proper names in Latin, e.g. catus 'sly' vs. Catō (G. Catōnis) 'the Sly One', and in Greek, e.g. platús 'broad' vs. Plátōn 'the Broad (Shouldered) One'.

17.1 Weak Adjective Formation
As mentioned above, the weak declension of adjectives is actually simply n-stem declension. The weak masculine endings of a-stem adjectives exactly parallel those of the an-stem noun atta, and the neuter a-stem weak endings those of the an-stem haírtō (Section 16.1); the feminine weak endings of a-stem adjectives parallel those of the ōn-stem noun tuggō (Section 16.2). Again the adjective blinds 'blind' illustrates the declension.

Weak a-Stem	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	blinda	 	blindō	 	blindō
A	 	blindan	 	blindō	 	blindōn
G	 	blindins	 	blindins	 	blindōns
D	 	blindin	 	blindin	 	blindōn
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	blindans	 	blindōna	 	blindōns
A	 	blindans	 	blindōna	 	blindōns
G	 	blindanē	 	blindanē	 	blindōnō
D	 	blindam	 	blindam	 	blindōm
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The ja-stem adjectives decline analogously, the masculine forms following the jan-stem noun arbja, the neuter following sigljō, the feminine following arbjō. The distinctions of Group (1) and Group (2) ja-stems do not play a role in weak declension. Likewise, i-stem and u-stem adjectives follow the same weak declension as ja-stems, exhibiting the same j-augment in all forms. The adjectives niujis 'new' and wilþeis 'wild' illustrate the weak declension of ja-stems; hráins 'clean' illustrates the i-stems; hardus 'hard' illustrates the u-stems. The forms are as follows.

Masculine	 	ja-Stem (1)	 	ja-Stem (2)	 	i-Stem	 	u-Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	niuja	 	wilþja	 	hráinja	 	hardja

D	 	niujōm	 	wilþjōm	 	hráinjōm	 	hardjōm
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The wa-stem adjectives maintain the w-augment. Few weak forms are extant. The adjective triggws 'true' exhibits only the weak N sg. triggwa and D sg. triggwin. The wa-stem adjectives lasiws 'weak', *qius 'alive', *fáus 'little', *usskáus 'vigilant' show no weak forms.

17.2 Comparative, Superlative, and Intensive Adjectives
The comparative of adjectives is formed by addition of the suffix -iz- or -ōz-. The superlative is derived by addition of the suffix -st- or -ōst-. Consider the following examples.

Meaning	 	Positive	 	Comparative	 	Superlative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
'much, many'	 	manags	 	managiza	 	managists
'wise'	 	frōþs	 	frōdōza	 	 
'poor'	 	arms	 	 	 	armōsts
'strong'	 	swinþs	 	swinþōza	 	 
'old'	 	alþeis	 	alþiza	 	 
'sweet'	 	suts	 	sutiza	 	sutists
'hard'	 	hardus	 	hardiza	 	 
'high'	 	*háuhs	 	 	 	háuhists
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
As with the positive degree, the superlative degree declines either strong or weak according to the requirements of context. The superlative, however, does not take the alternate pronominal ending -ata in the neuter singular nominative or accusative. The comparative, by contrast, only assumes weak adjectival endings, regardless of context. The only difference between comparative endings and general weak adjectival endings occurs in the feminine: the feminine declines like the īn-stem managei, rather than tuggō. The adjective jūhiza 'younger', from juggs 'young', serves to illustrate comparative declension.

Comparative	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	jūhiza	 	jūhizō	 	jūhizei
A	 	jūhizan	 	jūhizō	 	jūhizein
G	 	jūhizins	 	jūhizins	 	jūhizeins
D	 	jūhizin	 	jūhizin	 	jūhizein
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	jūhizans	 	jūhizōna	 	jūhizeins
A	 	jūhizans	 	jūhizōna	 	jūhizeins
G	 	jūhizanē	 	jūhizanē	 	jūhizeinō
D	 	jūhizam	 	jūhizam	 	jūhizeim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Several adjectives are members of suppletive systems, whereby the positive forms derive from a base different than that of the comparative and superlative. A few of the most common such adjectives appear below.

Meaning	 	Positive	 	Comparative	 	Superlative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
'good'	 	gōþs	 	batiza	 	batists
'little'	 	leitils	 	minniza	 	minnists
'great'	 	mikils	 	máiza	 	máists
'old'	 	sineigs	 	 	 	sinista
'evil'	 	ubils	 	waírsiza	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The superlative sinista generally translates Greek presbúteros 'elder': þái sinistans 'the elders'.

Intensive adjectives are formed by addition of the ending -(t)uma. These formations inflect like comparatives, but they generally do not mark any specific comparison. These have a superlative formed by adding -(t)umist-. Consider the following examples.

Intensitve	 	Meaning	 	Superlative	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
aftuma	 	'latter, following'	 	aftumists	 	'last'
aúhuma	 	'high'	 	aúh(u)mists	 	'highest'
fruma	 	'former, prior'	 	frumists	 	'first'
 	 	 	 	hindumists	 	'hindmost, uttermost'
hleiduma	 	'the left'	 	 	 	 
iftuma	 	'next, following'	 	 	 	 
innuma	 	'inner'	 	 	 	 
miduma	 	'middle'	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	spēdumists	 	'last, latest'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Compare af-tuma to Lat. op-timus, as well as in-timus and Sanskrit án-tamas. Likewise compare the formation of ordinals such as Lat. septimus, Sanskrit saptamás.

The dative case is used in conjunction with a comparative to denote the standard of reference or comparison, as denoted by the Modern English 'than'. For example, swinþō mis 'mightier than me'.

18 Relatives, Interrogatives, and Indefinites
18.1 Relatives
As with the other Germanic languages, Gothic has no independent pronoun which functions specifically as a relative. The most prominent relative marker is the particle ei, which functions analogously to Old Norse es (later er) or sem (or even the conjunction at 'that') and to Old English þe. These particles are self-standing markers introducing subordinate clauses and as such have no inherent meaning of their own. In Gothic the relative use of the particle ei is restricted to a few phrases involving temporal or modal expressions. For example, sijáis þahands jah ni magands rodjan und þana dag ei waírþái þata 'thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that this should happen' (Luke 1.20); fram þamma daga ei anabáuþ mis 'from the time that it befell me' (Nehemiah 5.14); fram þamma daga ei háusidēdum 'since the day we heard it' (Colossians 1.9); aþþan þamma háidáu ei Jannis jah Mambrēs andstōþun Mōsēza 'Now in the manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses' (2 Timothy 3.8).

The particle ei occurs most frequently in a relativizing role conjoined to the demonstrative pronoun sa, þata, sō 'this, that, the'. This yields a relative pronoun for the third person. The declension is as follows.

Relative Pron.	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	saei (izei)	 	þatei	 	sōei (sei)
A	 	þanei	 	þatei	 	þōei
G	 	þizei	 	þizei	 	þizōzei
D	 	þammei	 	þammei	 	þizáiei
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þáiei (izei)	 	þōei	 	þōzei
A	 	þanzei	 	þōei	 	þōzei
G	 	þizēei	 	þizēei	 	*þizōei
D	 	þáimei	 	þáimei	 	þáimei
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
When the particle ei is suffixed, a preceding weakly stressed a is lost, and s becomes z. The nominative singular masculine is of the third person pronoun also forms a relative in this manner: izei. This is occasionally found instead of the corresponding relative saei. It also occurs in the role of the nominative masculine plural instead of þáiei. The nominative singular feminine si of the third person pronoun similarly forms a relative si + ei > sei.

The first and second person pronouns form relatives in the same fashion. The particle ei is suffixed to the appropriate form of the pronoun: ikei 'I who'; þuei 'thou who'; þukei 'thee whom'; þuzei 'to thee whom'; juzei 'ye who'; izwizei 'to you whom'.

Like Modern English, but unlike Old English and Old Norse, the relative pronoun saei, þatei, sōei derives its case from its function in the relative clause. In the Modern English sentence 'and a man came whose name was Jairus', the relative whose derives its case (genitive) from its function in the clause 'whose name was Jairus', not from the clause in which its antecedent man appears (otherwise it would be the nominative who, agreeing with man). By contrast, Old Norse favors a construction in which the demonstrative agrees with the antecedent in the main clause: hann sendi hingat til lands prest þann es hét Þangbrandr 'he sent there to the land a priest who was called Thangbrand'. The phrase þann es exactly parallels the formation of the relative pronoun in Gothic, being the union of the demonstrative pronoun followed by the relative particle (es in ON, ei in Gothic). But in the Old Norse phrase, þann is accusative, modifying the direct object of the main clause, even though the antecedent of þann subsequently becomes the subject of the relative clause. The same generally occurs in Old English with the particle |e. Gothic uses the relative saei, þatei, sōei in the fashion of Modern English. For example, jah sái qam waír þizei namō Iaeirus 'And a man came whose name (was) Jairus' (Luke 8.41). The relative þizei takes its genitive case from its function in the relative clause, not from the main clause.

18.2 Interrogatives
The interrogative pronoun ƕas, ƕa, ƕō 'who?, what?' occurs only in the singular. The forms are as follows.

Interrogative	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ƕas	 	ƕa	 	ƕō
A	 	ƕana	 	ƕa	 	ƕō
G	 	ƕis	 	ƕis	 	*ƕizōs
D	 	ƕamma	 	ƕamma	 	ƕizái
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The neuter instrumental form ƕē occurs with the meaning 'with what, wherewith, how'. The plural is preserved in the form ƕanzuh: insandida ins twans ƕanzuh 'he sent them forth two and two'.

The interrogative adjective ƕaþar 'which (of two)' occurs only in the nominative singular masculine and neuter. This contrasts with ƕarjis 'which (of more than two)', which declines like midjis (cf. Section 13.1), though the neuter nominative singular always ends in -ata. The interrogative adjectives ƕileiks 'what sort of' and *ƕēláuþs (fem. ƕēláuda) 'how great' follow the declension of blinds (cf. Section 13.1), as do their respective correlatives swaleiks 'such' and swaláuþs (fem. swaláuda) 'so great'.

The enclitic particle -u is often appended to the first word of an interrogative statement. For example, niu 'not?'; skuldu ist 'is it lawful?'; abu þus silbin 'of thyself?'

18.3 Indefinites
Simple indefinites, formed by suffixing the particle -hun to forms of ƕas 'who', manna 'man', and áins 'one', occur only in negated constructions. See Section 21.2 on Negatives.

A general indefinite, akin to Modern English 'whosoever, whoever', is formed by the combinations ƕazuh saei, saƕazuh saei, and saƕazuh izei. These occur only in the nominative singular masculine. The neuter counterpart, þataƕah þei 'whatsoever', occurs only in the accusative singular. Indefinites of similar meaning are formed by prefixing þis (genitive of þata) to forms of ƕazuh. These are followed by the relative saei, or by þei. The attested forms are as follows.

þisƕazuh saei 'whosoever'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	þisƕazuh saei	 	þisƕah þei (þatei)	 	 
A	 	þisƕanōh saei	 	þisƕah þei (þatei)	 	 
G	 	 	 	þisƕizuh þei	 	 
D	 	þisƕammēh saei	 	þisƕammēh þei	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The form þatei occasionally replaces þei in the neuter. No feminine forms occur.

áin- 'one, anyone, a certain one' always declines according to the strong declension of blinds (Section 13.1), e.g. masc. N sg. áins, pl. áinái; neut. N sg. áin(ata), pl. áina; fem. N sg. áina, pl. áinōs. The plural forms are used in the sense 'only, alone'. Note correlated structures: áins... jah áins 'the one... and the other'.

all- 'all, every, whole' always declines according to the strong declension of blinds, e.g. masc. N sg. alls, pl. allái; neut. N sg. all(ata), pl. alla; fem. N sg. alla, pl. allōs.

anþar- 'second, other' always declines according to the strong declension of blinds, though the neuter N sg. never takes the pronominal ending -ata. For example, masc. N sg. anþar (cf. Section 6.2.2), pl. anþarái; neut. N sg. anþar, pl. anþara; fem. N sg. anþara, pl. anþarō.

sum- 'some one, a certain one' always declines according to the strong declension of blinds, e.g. masc. N sg. sums, pl. sumái; neut. N sg. sum(ata), pl. suma; fem. N sg. suma, pl. sumōs. Forms of this pronoun are often repeated in correlated structures: sums... sums 'the one... the other'. The particle -uh is frequently suffixed to the second member of such constructions, and occasionally to both members: sumái(h)... sumáih 'some... and others' (masc. nom. pl.).

19 Present Participle
The present participle adds the suffix -nd- to the present stem (yielding a stem which resembles the 3rd person plural, present indicative active). Adjectival endings are then added to the resulting stem. The present participle declines exclusively as a weak adjective, with the sole exception of the masculine nominative singular, which has an alternate strong ending. The feminine forms follow the declension of īn-stem nouns like managei, rather than ōn-stems. The verb niman 'take' has present participle stem nimand-. The declension is as follows.

Present Ptcple	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	nimanda, nimands	 	nimandō	 	nimandei
A	 	nimandan	 	nimandō	 	nimandein
G	 	nimandins	 	nimandins	 	nimandeins
D	 	nimandin	 	nimandin	 	nimandein
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	nimandans	 	nimandōna	 	nimandeins
A	 	nimandans	 	nimandōna	 	nimandeins
G	 	nimandanē	 	nimandanē	 	nimandeinō
D	 	nimandam	 	nimandam	 	nimandeim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The present participle denotes an action ongoing at the time of the main verb. The present participle generally takes its object in the same case as the finite forms of the participle, though frequently the object is omitted. For example, þái waúrd háusjandans 'those hearing the word' (Mark 4.18); Sa saijands waúrd saijiþ 'The one sowing sows the word', equivalent to 'The sower sows the word' (Mark 4.14).

Some nouns, such as the nd-stem fijands 'enemy', were originally participles but have subsequently become frozen in a substantive role. These infrequently take objects in the accusative, instead generally employing the genitive. Compare the following contructions: þans fijands galgins Xristáus 'the enemies of the cross of Christ' (Philippians 3.18) vs. þáim fijandam izwis 'to those hating you' (Luke 6.27). Also note the following passage: aþþan ik qiþa izwis: frijōþ fijands izwarans, þiuþjáiþ þans wrikandans izwis, wáila táujáiþ þáim hatjandam izwis, jah bidjáiþ bi þans usþriutandans izwis 'But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those abusing you' (Matthew 5.44).

20 Adjective Use
Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in gender, case, and number. But the adjective at times agrees with the natural gender of the referent, rather than with the gender of the noun representing it. Consider the following example, where the feminine noun handugei 'wisdom' is modified by a neuter adjective agreeing with the genderless concept represented by handugei: ei kanniþ wēsi handugei guþs 'that the wisdom of God be known'. Note also the following, where neuter áinhun (leikē) 'any (of bodies)' is modified by a masculine singular adjective taking its gender from the person or man whom the circumlocution represents: ni waírþiþ garaíhts áinhun leikē 'no man becomes just'.

When a singular noun denotes a collection of individual members, the adjective may take its number and gender according to the individuals. For example, the feminine singular managei 'multitude, people' is generally modified by adjectives in the masculine plural: jah was managei beidandans Zakariins 'and the people were waiting for Zacharias'. This likewise occurs with the noun hiuhma 'crowd': jah alls hiuhma was manageins beidandans 'and the whole crowd of people was waiting'.

Unlike many of the Indo-European languages, but like e.g. Old Norse, an adjective modifying both masculine and feminine beings takes a neuter plural form. For example, wēsunuh þan garaíhta ba andwaírþja guþs 'they were both righteous before God', where the referents are Zacharias and Elizabeth.

Adjectives take either strong or weak endings. Strong adjective forms modify indefinite nouns. Consider the following examples: stibnái mikilái 'in a loud voice'; gaguds ragineis 'a good counselor'; wastjái ƕeitái 'in a white cloth'. Predicate adjectives regularly take strong endings: goþ þus ist hamfamma in libáin galeiþan 'it is better for thee to enter into life maimed'. All cardinal numerals only decline strong, as well as the ordinal anþar 'second'; likewise the possessive adjectives like meins 'my'; pronominal adjectives like sums 'some', alls 'all', jáins 'that', swaleiks 'such'; and other adjectives like fulls 'full', ganōhs 'enough', halbs 'half', midjis 'middle'.

Weak adjective forms modify definite nouns, and therefore generally accompany the definite article. For example, stiur þana alidan 'the fattened calf'; (áina) anabusnē þizō minnistōnō '(one) of the smallest commandments'; wastja þō frumistōn 'the best garment'; ni mag bagms þiuþeigs akrana ubila gatáujan 'a good tree cannot bear evil fruits'. A weak adjective generally accompanies a noun in the vocative: atta weiha 'holy father!'; o unfrodans Galateis 'O foolish Galatians'. All ordinal numerals beside anþar exhibit only weak declension. The same is true for comparatives, as well as intensives ending in -ma, e.g. aftuma 'latter'. The present participle takes weak endings, except for the alternate strong ending in the masculine nominative singular. The adjectives sama 'same' and silba 'self' always take weak endings.

Translation
From the King James version:
6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
9 After this manner therefore pray ye:
 	 	Our Father which art in heaven,
 	 	Hallowed be thy name.
 	 	10 Thy kingdom come.
 	 	Thy will be done
 	 	in earth, as it is in heaven.
 	 	11 Give us this day our daily bread.
 	 	12 And forgive us our debts,
 	 	as we forgive our debtors.
 	 	13 And lead us not into temptation,
 	 	but deliver us from evil:
 	 	For thine is the kingdom, and the power,
 	 	and the glory, for ever. Amen.
14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
Grammar
21 Distributive and Negative Pronouns and Adjectives
21.1 Distributives
The interrogative ƕaþar forms a distributive by addition of the particle -uh: ƕaþaruh 'each (of two)'. Only the dative masculine occurs, both alone (ƕaþarammēh) and in composition (áinƕaþarammēh 'to each one (of two)').

The pronoun ƕas, ƕa, ƕō also forms a distributive by suffixing -uh: ƕazuh, ƕah, ƕōh 'each, every'. The declension is as follows.

ƕazuh 'each'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ƕazuh	 	ƕah	 	ƕōh
A	 	ƕanōh	 	ƕah	 	ƕōh
G	 	ƕizuh	 	ƕizuh	 	*ƕizōzuh
D	 	ƕammēh	 	ƕammēh	 	*ƕizáih
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	 	 	 	 	 
A	 	ƕanzuh	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The only plural form is the masculine accusative plural ƕanzuh. Before -uh, an s changes to z. The u of the suffix -uh drops after a long vowel or stressed a.

The adjective ƕarjis likewise forms a distributive by affixing -uh: ƕarjizuh 'each, every'. The declension is as follows.

ƕarjizuh 'each'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ƕarjizuh	 	ƕarjatōh	 	*ƕarjōh
A	 	ƕarjanōh	 	*ƕarjatōh	 	ƕarjōh
G	 	ƕarjizuh	 	*ƕarjizuh	 	*ƕarjizōzuh
D	 	ƕarjammēh	 	ƕarjammēh	 	*ƕarjáih
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
This adjective occurs with the uninflected prefix áin- to form the compound áinƕarjizuh 'every one'. The attested forms are as follows.

áinƕarjizuh 'every one'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	áinƕarjizuh	 	áinƕarjatōh	 	 
A	 	áinƕarjanōh	 	 	 	áinƕarjōh
G	 	áinƕarjizuh	 	 	 	 
D	 	áinƕarjammēh	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The stem ba- 'both' only survives in a few forms, naturally plural. The attested forms are as follows.

ba- 'both'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	bái, bajōþs	 	ba	 	 
A	 	bans	 	ba	 	 
G	 	 	 	 	 	 
D	 	báim, bajōþum	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
21.2 Negatives
The particle -hun is suffixed to forms of ƕas 'who', manna 'man', and áins 'one' to form indefinite pronouns, ƕashun, mannahun, áinshun. These always occur with the negative particle ni in the meaning 'no one, nothing, no, none'. The compound form of ƕas occurs only in the nominative singular masculine: ni ƕashun 'no one'. The compound forms of manna occur only in the masculine singular. The compound forms of áins occur at least in part for all genders. The attested forms of these pronouns are as follows.

-hun Compounds	 	Masculine	 	Masculine	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ƕashun	 	mannahun	 	áinshun	 	áinhun	 	áinōhun
A	 	 	 	mannanhun	 	áinnōhun, áinōhun	 	áinhun	 	áinōhun
G	 	 	 	manshun	 	áinishun	 	*áinishun	 	*áináizōshun
D	 	 	 	mannhun	 	áinummēhun	 	*áinummēhun	 	*áináihun
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note that the first element of each compound declines, while only the -hun remains invariant. The base áins- declines according to the strong declension of blinds (Section 13.1), except that is has -ē- or -ō- where blinds has a final -a. Note also the forms áin-(n)ō-hun (masc. acc.; compare blind-ana) and áin-ummē-hun (masc. dat.; compare blind-amma). For the particle -hun, compare Sanskrit -ca-ná (where -na is a negative particle) in kás caná 'any one'. Note also -que in Latin quisque 'whoever'.

The feminine noun waíhts 'thing, matter' occurs with the negative ni 'no, not', as does a neuter form waíht, to express 'nothing' (Greek oudén or mēdén).

40	 	fidwōr tigjus	 	 
50	 	fimf tigjus	 	 
60	 	saíhs tigjus	 	 
70	 	sibuntēhund	 	 
80	 	ahtáutēhund	 	 
90	 	niuntēhund (gen. niuntēhundis)	 	 
100	 	taíhuntēhund, taíhuntaíhund	 	 
200	 	twa hunda	 	 
300	 	þrija hunda	 	 
400	 	 	 	 
500	 	fimf hunda	 	 
600	 	 	 	 
700	 	 	 	 
800	 	 	 	 
900	 	niun hunda	 	 
1,000	 	þūsundi	 	 
2,000	 	twōs þūsundjōs	 	 
3,000	 	g (= þreis) þūsundjōs	 	 
4,000	 	fidwōr þūsundjōs	 	 
5,000	 	fimf þūsundjōs	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
10,000	 	dat. taíhun þūsundjōm	 	 
20,000	 	dat. twáim tigum þūsundjō	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
The form tigjus which appears in the cardinal decades 20-60 is the nominative plural of a u-stem noun meaning 'group of ten, decade' (cf. Section 7.2). These numerals govern the genitive case. The hundreds 200, 300, 500, 900 combine the individual units and the neuter noun hund 'hundred', which declines like the neuter a-stem waúrd (Section 3.1). These numerals govern the genitive case. The feminine noun þūsundi 'thousand' declines like the jō-stem noun bandi (Section 3.2). The numerals denoting thousands govern the genitive case.

22.2 Numeral Declension
The cardinal numbers 1 through 3 are decline as adjectives, agreeing with the noun they modify in gender, number, and case. The numeral áins 'one' occurs in both singular and plural; in the plural it means 'only, alone'. It follows the strong a-stem adjective declension of blinds. The cardinals 2 and 3 naturally occur only in the plural. No forms of 3 occur in the nominative, though the expected masculine and feminine form is *þreis, and neuter *þrija mimicking the accusative. The declensions are given below.

áins 'one'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	áins	 	áin, áinata	 	áina

N Pl.	 	twái	 	twa	 	twōs
A	 	twans	 	twa	 	twōs

D	 	twáim	 	twáim	 	twáim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*þreis 'three'	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	*þreis	 	*þrija	 	*þreis
A	 	þrins	 	þrija	 	þrins
G	 	þrijē	 	 	 	 
D	 	þrim	 	þrim	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The cardinal numbers 4-15 generally remain uninflected, though some inflected forms occur. The attested forms are genitive and dative plurals exhibiting i-stem declension. For example, dative forms are fidwōrim, taíhunim, áinlibim, twalibim, fimf taíhunim; genitives are niunē, twalibē.

The attested ordinals decline as adjectives. The ordinal fruma 'first' (cf. Section 17.2) declines as a weak adjective, with the feminine following the īn-stem declension of managei. The forms are as follows.

fruma 'first'	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	fruma	 	frumō	 	frumei
A	 	fruman	 	frumō	 	frumein
G	 	frumins	 	frumins	 	frumeins
D	 	frumin	 	frumin	 	frumein
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	frumans	 	frumōna	 	frumeins
A	 	frumans	 	frumōna	 	frumeins
G	 	frumanē	 	frumanē	 	frumeinō
D	 	frumam	 	frumam	 	frumeim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The form frumists may be declined strong (following blinds) or weak, though when weak it does not take the pronominal ending -ata in the neuter singular nominative and accusative. The ordinal anþar 'second' only declines strong like blinds, and likewise does not take the ending -ata: N sg. masc. anþar, neut. anþar, fem. anþara. The other ordinals -- þridja 'third', fimfta 'fifth', saíhsta 'sixth', ahtuda 'eighth', niunda 'ninth', taíhunda 'tenth', fimftataíhunda 'fifteenth' -- all decline weak according to the pattern of blinda.

22.3 Distributive and Multiplicative Numerals
The distributive ba- signifies 'both', occurring in only a few forms. See Section 21.1 above.

The only distributive numeral is tweihnái 'two each'. Only the feminine accusative tweihnōs and dative tweihnáim are attested. Otherwise, distributive numerals are expressed by phrases involving a preposition or a distributive pronoun such as ƕazuh 'each, every' or ƕarjizuh 'each, every'. For example, bi twans aíþþáu máist þrins 'by twos or at most (by) threes'; ana ƕarjanōh fimftiguns 'by fifties in each' (more literally 'according to each fifty(es)'); insandida ins twans ƕanzuh 'he sent them forth two each', i.e. 'two and two' or 'by twos'.

The adjective -falþ, corresponding to Modern English '-fold' in e.g. 'manifold', is appended to cardinals to form multiplicative numerals. The following are attested: áinfalþs 'onefold, simple'; fidurfalþs 'fourfold'; taíhuntaíhundfalþs 'hundredfold'; managfalþs 'manifold'.

22.4 Numeral Adverbs
Numeral adverbs denoting frequency or the number of times of occurrence are composed of a numeral in conjunction with the dative singular or plural of the noun *sinþs 'a going, time'. These are áinamma sinþa 'once'; anþaramma sinþa 'a second time'; twáim sinþam 'twice'; þrim sinþam 'thrice'; fimf sinþam 'five times'; sibun sinþam 'seven times'.

23 The First Strong Conjugation
Strong verbs are characterized by vocalic alternation accompanying morphological change. This so-called ablaut pattern differs among verbs, but similarities are frequent enough that strong verbs fall into a small number of ablaut classes, the members of a given class sharing the same sequence of vocalic alternation. The particular sequence characterizing a given strong verb class is the result of a number of sound changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc), and from the latter to the respective daughter languages. The morpheme structure of the root in PIE uniquely characterizes the ablaut class to which a verb belongs; subsequent evolution into Germanic and the resulting daughter languages, however, has restructured this characterization. The following chart shows an example of the evolution of a verb from PIE to the PGmc class I strong conjugation, and then gives examples of class I strong verbs from Gothic.

Class I	 	Root Shape	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PIE	 	(K)Vi(C)	 	e	 	o	 	zero	 	zero	 	 
 	 	 	 	*ghréibō	 	*ghróiba	 	*ghribmé	 	*ghribón	 	'seize'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PGmc	 	(K)V(C)	 	ī	 	ai	 	i (EG i/e)	 	o (EG i/e)	 	 
 	 	 	 	*grīpu (EG -a)	 	*graip	 	*gripum	 	*gripan	 	'seize'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Goth.	 	 	 	ei [ī]	 	ái	 	i / aí [e]	 	i / aí [e]	 	 
 	 	 	 	greipa	 	gráip	 	gripum	 	gripans	 	'seize'
 	 	 	 	-teiha	 	-táih	 	-taíhum	 	-taíhans	 	'tell'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
EG stands for East Germanic, the branch of Germanic to which Gothic belongs. K stands for any consonant sequence, C for any single consonant, V for any vowel. Items in parentheses may or may not be present. The resulting ablaut pattern characterizing the first strong conjugation in Gothic thus becomes the following.

Class	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.
Ia	 	ei [ī]	 	ái	 	i	 	i
Ib	 	ei [ī]	 	ái	 	aí [e]	 	aí [e]
The difference between Classes Ia and Ib lies solely in the vowel of the past plural and participle stems. The change is conditioned by the consonant following the vowel. Generally the vowel i occurs, but this is replaced by aí when followed by h. Take for example the past participles stigans vs. þaíhans.

The verb greipa 'seize', with prinicpal parts greipa -- gráip -- gripum -- gripans, serves to illustrate the forms of the first conjugation. The forms are as follows.

Class I	 	Active	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive

Past Ptc.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	gripans	 	 
24 The Second Strong Conjugation
The second strong conjugation comprises verbs whose present system often shows the diphthong iu. The historical evolution of these verbs is shown in the chart below.

Class II	 	Root Shape	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PIE	 	(K)Vu(C)	 	e	 	o	 	zero	 	zero	 	 
 	 	 	 	*néudō	 	*nóuda	 	*nudmé	 	*nudón	 	'enjoy'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PGmc	 	(K)V(C)	 	eu (EG iu)	 	au	 	u (EG u/o)	 	o (EG u/o)	 	 
 	 	 	 	*néutu (EG *níuta)	 	*naut	 	*nutum	 	*notan (EG *nutan)	 	'enjoy'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Goth.	 	 	 	iu	 	áu	 	u / aú [o]	 	u / aú [o]	 	 
 	 	 	 	niuta	 	náut	 	nutum	 	nutans	 	'enjoy'
 	 	 	 	tiuha	 	táuh	 	taúhum	 	taúhans	 	'lead'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note that the root shape, though distinct from Class I in the PIE period, is no longer distinct in the PGmc period. At this stage, only the choice of V distinguishes the classes: V = ī in the Class I present, V = eu or V = iu in the Class II present. The resulting ablaut pattern characterizing the second strong conjugation in Gothic thus becomes the following.

Class	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.
IIa	 	iu	 	áu	 	u	 	u
IIb	 	iu	 	áu	 	aú [o]	 	aú [o]
As in the first strong conjugation, the difference between Classes IIa and IIb lies solely in the vowel of the past plural and participle stems. This change is also conditioned by the consonant following the vowel. Generally the vowel u occurs, but this is replaced by aú when followed by h. Take for example the past plural forms drusum vs. taúhum.

The verb niuta 'enjoy', with prinicpal parts niuta -- náut -- nutum -- nutans, serves to illustrate the forms of the second conjugation. The forms are as follows.

Class II	 	Active	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive

25 Adverbs
25.1 General
Gothic employs various mechanisms for deriving adverbs. A few of these methods are described below.

Genitive case. Nouns may stand in the genitive and adverbially qualify a clause as a whole, rather than qualify a specific noun. Examples are allis 'in general, wholly'; and-waírþis 'over against'; nahts 'at night'; raíhtis 'however, indeed'.

Suffix -ba. This suffix generally derives adverbs of manner from associated adjectives. For example, agluba 'with difficulty'; ana-láugniba 'secretly'; baírtaba 'brightly'; báitraba 'bitterly'; balþaba 'boldly'; ga-tēmiba 'fitly'; glaggwaba, glaggwuba 'diligently, precisely'; hardaba, harduba 'grievously'; háuhaba 'highly'; ƕassaba 'sharply'; manwuba 'in readiness'; mikilaba 'greatly'; raíhtaba 'rightly'; sunjaba 'truly'; ubilaba 'evilly'.

Suffix -ō. This suffix frequently derives adverbs from adjectives. For example, and-áugjō 'openly'; ana-leikō 'in like manner'; ga-leikō 'like'; glaggwō 'diligently'; sinteinō 'continually'; sniumundō 'quickly'; spráutō 'quickly'; þiubjō 'secretly'; þridjō 'for the third time'; ūhteigō 'in season'. This suffix is found with other adverbs, e.g. aftarō 'behind'; aúftō 'perhaps, surely'; missō 'one another'; sundrō 'asunder'; ufarō 'above'; undarō 'beneath'.

Suffix -ē. This suffix occurs less frequently than the others. Examples are simlē 'once'; swarē 'in vain'.

25.2 Negation, Affirmation, and Interrogation
The adverb corresponding to Modern English 'Yes.' is ja or jái; that corresponding to Modern English 'No.' is nē. The adverb ni 'no' is the general negative adverb within statements.

The adverb -u is a postpositive particle marking questions, much the same as Latin -ne. For example, skuldu ist? 'is it lawful?' This adverb may also intervene between prefix and base, as in ga-u-láubjats 'do ye two believe?' Other interrogative particles are the following: an 'then'; ibái, requiring a negative answer; ja-u 'whether'; ni-u 'not'; nuh 'then'; þáu 'or', in the second of two alternative questions.

25.3 Temporal Adverbs
Adverbs denoting time are generally simple adverbs or are nouns or noun phrases in an oblique case. Examples of simple adverbs are the following: áir 'early'; aftra 'again'; ƕan 'when'; ju 'already'; naúh 'still'; nu 'now'; þan 'then'; ufta 'often'. Examples involving oblique nominal forms are the following: dagis ƕizuh 'day by day'; du maúrgina 'tomorrow'; fram himma nu 'henceforth'; gistra-dagis 'tomorrow'; himma daga 'today'.

25.4 Local Adverbs
There are a few common, simple adverbs referring to location or motion. These are faúr 'before'; inn 'in, within'; iup 'upwards'; nēƕ 'near, close by'; ūt 'out, forth'.

A number of suffixes are used to form adverbs expressing location or differing types or directions of motion. These are listed below.

Suffix -a. Used to denote stationary location. For example, afta 'behind'; dalaþa 'below'; faúra 'before'; inna 'within'; iupa 'above'; ūta 'without'.

Suffix -drē. Used to denote motion toward a place. For example, hidrē 'hither'; ƕadrē 'whither'; jaindrē 'thither'.

Suffix -na. Used to denote motion from a place. For example, aftana 'from behind'; hindana 'from behind'; innana 'from within'; iupana 'from above'; ūtana 'from without'.

Suffix -ō. Used to denote stationary location. See the discussion in Section 25.1 above.

Suffix -r. Used to denote stationary location. For example, hēr 'here'; ƕar 'where'; jáinar 'yonder'; þar 'there'.

Suffix -þ -(d). Used to denote motion toward a place. For example, aljaþ 'in another direction'; dalaþ 'down'; ƕaþ 'whither'; jaind 'thither'; samaþ 'to the same place'.

Suffix -þrō. Used to denote motion from a place. For example, aljaþrō 'from elsewhere'; allaþrō 'from all directions'; dalaþrō 'from below'; faírraþrō 'from afar'; ƕaþrō 'whence'; innaþrō 'from within'; iupaþrō 'from above'; jáinþrō 'thence'; þaþrō 'thence'.

25.5 Comparison of Adverbs
The comparative degree of adverbs generally ends in -(i)s or -ōs. Examples are áiris 'earlier'; faúrþis 'beforehand'; framis 'further'; haldis 'rather'; háuhis 'higher'; máis 'more'; nēƕis 'nearer'; mins 'less'; waírs 'worse'; aljaleikōs 'otherwise'; sniumundōs 'with more haste'.

The superlative degree ends in -ist. Few superlative adverbs are attested: frumist 'first of all'; máist 'at most'.

Lesson 6
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Gothic Social Organization
Determining the social structure of the Goths during the first centuries in which they come into history is particularly difficult because few sources have any direct knowledge of the Goths -- and those that do, unfortunately, do not treat the topic directly or in any depth. The majority of sources in the fourth century discuss the Tervingi, Goths located in the area of the Danube, to the west of the Greuthungi. An important source, albeit an indirect one, is the translation of Wulfila: the Bible offers a wealth of social and political institutions of Jewish society of a few centuries earlier, and their interaction with Roman political institutions. Comparing our understanding of these institutions with how Wulfila chose to translate the Greek text offers a window into the societal structure of the audience of Wulfila's translation.

Etymology offers a picture of the long-term survival and development of cultural institutions as preserved in a language; but this picture is generally coarse-grained because of the timespan over which regular and specifiable linguistic changes occur. In addition, the vagaries of cultural change and idiomatic language habits imply that at any given moment a term may be applied to a thing or circumstance which is not predictable as the accumulation of the linguistic history of the word up to that point: for example, English broadcast, though a sensible compound for the intended purpose, is not predictable in its current use for 'radio or television program' as a result of the combination of meanings 'wide' and 'throw (a net)'. This unpredictability may occur for no other reason than that the required apparati, the radio and television, did not exist in any prior period: references to new technology may make novel use of old vocabulary.

Specifying through solely etymological methods precisely how a word was used at any specific point in its history generally requires knowing both its history before and after the period in question, so that a sort of triangulation method may be applied to refine possiblities for the meaning of the word in any given intermediate period. Such methods are limited when attempting to discover how the Gothic language, as found in Wulfila's translation, is applied by its speakers to their current social institutions for the simple reason that Wulfila's translation is the terminus of our information about the Gothic language.

To complement the results of etymological investigation, scholars may thus turn to methods of textual comparison. Specifically, they may focus on how Wulfila translated elements of Biblical culture, and estimate how these would be understood by Wulfila himself, and how these are mapped onto Gothic social structure. Combining this with the history of the terms involved provides another method of triangulation in order to pinpoint Gothic social institutions concurrent with Wulfila's translation. This may be further compared with other socio-cultural depictions found in contemporary literature.

The following are estimates of the meaning of various Gothic terms at the time of the Biblical translation, based on the above method of textual comparison, coupled with crossreferencing from contemporary sources. These are necessarily imperfect and tentative. To limit their inaccuracies further, it must be said that this only necessarily applies to the Tervingi, and extension to the social structures of other Goths such as the Greuthungi, for whom there is scant cultural information, is precarious at best.

Collective units, in rough order of importance, are as follows:

Gutþiuda: in origin 'the Gothic people', this came to signify those people living within Tervingian territory, whether enthnically Goths or not. This probably included the Taifali, a perhaps Celtic or Vandalic group of nomadic horsemen who were evidently averse to permanent settlement, but who formed a tribal confederation with the Tervingi.
gafaúrds: the chief 'tribal council', composed of representatives of each kuni, most importantly the reiks, but also the sinistans and máistans.
kuni: in origin 'race' or 'generation', this had come to signify a social subdivision, ruled by an individual reiks. There were several such kunja within the confederation, though one kuni would be distinguished as 'royal' and exercise more influence than the others. This was the most active political unit, and a member of the kuni was called an inkunja. Each kuni would typically have its own shrines and priests.
harjis: an 'army'. At the time of Wulfila, this signified a military unit whose size was on the order of a Roman legion, and so roughly three thousand men. Such an army could be raised by individual kunja, or by the Gutþiuda as a whole.
hansa: 'troop', a military unit. The size of a hansa is undefined, ranging in size from the equivalent of a Roman maniple to a Roman cohort.
háims: the organized village. This is the basic center of agriculture and commerce.
weihs: essentially equivalent to the háims as the organized village and basic center of commerce.
Individual offices and titles, in rough order of importance, were as follows:

þiudans: designating a 'king', particularly a monarchic king. This institution had evidently fallen into disuse by the time of Gothic texts. The office probably not only included military and political authority, but a sort of judgeship as well.
reiks: a 'ruler', in particular the head of a kuni. The title conferred political authority, but lacked the power residing in the judgeship. Such a personage would own a house, and be fráuja 'master' of this house and the dependents, as well as over his armed retainers, the andbahtōs and sipōnjōs.
*draúhtins: not extant in Gothic texts, but able to be inferred from words such as draúhti-witōþ 'military service' and draúhtinōn 'perform military service'. This signified a military leader probably on par with the reiks, the two terms likely being alternates for one another emphasizing different characteristics of the same office.
kindins: in origin the 'ruler' of a community related by descent, the term came to have the sense of 'governor' over a barbarian confederation, in particular a magistrate appointed by another official.
ragineis: a 'counselor'. Probably equal in status to kindins, if the two are in fact distinguishable.
sinista: in origin 'oldest', hence an 'elder'. These were members of the gafaúrds.
máists: in origin 'greatest', hence 'chief' or 'noble, magnate'. These were members of the gafaúrds.
inkunja: an individual member of a kuni.
fráuja: a 'lord'. Such an individual was a landed noble, owning a gards 'house(hold)', and responsible for the persons and activities in it.
baúrgja: an individual member of a baúrgs.
ingardja: an individual member of a gards.
andbahts: in origin 'servant', though likely in particular an armed retainer.
sipōneis: an armed retainer.
skalks: a slave.
*þius: a slave belonging to the family.
asneis: a day laborer generally employed at harvest time.
Structures and their environs, in rough order of importance, were as follows:

baúrgs: at the time of Wulfila, a walled fortification. A reiks would have set himself apart from other nobles by living in such a fortified structure.
gards: in origin 'fenced property', in the time of Wulfila this is an unfortified house, equivalent to a Roman manor. Nobles of less stature than the reiks would have lived in such structures. The head of such a household is the fráuja. The term stood for the structure, as well as those in it, such as the wife, children, relatives, and dependents.
gawi: in origin 'meadow', this denotes the lands surrounding the baúrgs.
Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is Mark 4:1-12, the parable of the Sower and the Seed. Looking at Mark 4.1, we find swaswē ina galeiþandan in skip gasitan in marein 'so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea'. The construction is actually an infinitival result clause, at its most basic swaswē... ina... gasitan 'so as... (for) him... to sit'. The participle galeiþandan is a masculine accusative modifying ina, '(for) him going'.

The verse Mark 4.5 is interesting for its peculiar uses of the genitive. In the first instance, there is the phrase in þizei 'on account of which, on account of this that'. The occurence of the genitive itself in a phrase with this meaning is not surprising: the genitive is often used to denote cause in Germanic languages, a feature of its adoption of the role of the ablative case found in other Indo-European languages. What is striking is its use with a strictly locative (hence dative in Germanic) or accusative preposition in, which rarely if ever occurs in other Germanic languages. Mark 4.5 also contains the phrase ni habáida diupáizōs aírþōs, literally 'it did not have of deep earth'. As encountered in a previous reading, the genitive often serves to replace a predicate nominative or accusative in negated clauses. Gothic shares this feature with Old Church Slavonic.

Mark 4.9 provides examples of the Gothic use of the subjunctive: saei habái áusōna háusjandōna, gaháusjái, literally 'he who has hearing ears, let him hear'. The latter verb, gaháusjái, shows the subjunctive in a hortatory function. But note also the use of the present subjunctive habái in a clause giving a general characteristic, rather than the indicative of Modern English.

Note also Mark 4.11: izwis atgiban ist kunnan rūna þiudangardjōs gudis, literally 'it is for you to know the rune of the kingdom of God'. Here we find an instance of the Gothic reflex of the word for 'rune'. The word rūna, along with its cognates, is eventually charged with deep significance in Germanic languages, and seemingly appropriate for the power of the Biblical statement made here. The meaning of its cognates in Germanic ranges anywhere from 'counsel, advice' to 'secret counsel' to 'secret' to 'mystery', or from 'secret counsel' to 'secret writings' to 'sacred writings' to 'writings' to 'runes'. Compare the Old Norse phrase rúnuom inom reginkunnom 'runes of divine origin' in verse 80 of the Hávamál. This sentiment is also present in the runic inscription in the Noleby Stone, c. 450 AD: runo fahi raginakudo tojeka 'I prepare the suitable divine rune...'.

Of course runes as a writing system seem to have been in origin solely utilitarian, likely lacking any particularly divine overtones. But over time in the North and West Germanic traditions, as the above references illustrate, they came to develop a sort of mystique, if for no other reason than that they were associated with the inspirational step that led to the initiation of writing in general. It is difficult to say to what degree such mystique should be read into the Gothic term, since Wulfila's translation actually predates both the Hávamál and the Noleby Stone by quite a span of time. If we must then have recourse to a translation of rūna devoid of mystical import, it is nevertheless a powerful term if understood as the 'privy counsel' due a noble from his advisors.

Translation
From the King James version:
4:1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. 9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: 12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
Grammar
26 The Third Strong Conjugation
The third strong conjugation comprises verbs whose present system generally shows the vowel i followed by a resonant (l,r,m,n) and one other consonant. The historical evolution of these verbs is shown in the chart below.

Class III	 	Root Shape	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PIE	 	(K)VRC	 	e	 	o	 	zero	 	zero	 	 
 	 	 	 	*bhéndhō	 	*bhóndha	 	*bhndhmé	 	*bhndhón	 	'tie'
 	 	 	 	*wérbō	 	*wórba	 	*wrbmé	 	*wrbón	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PGmc	 	(K)VNC	 	i	 	a	 	u	 	u	 	 
 	 	 	 	*bindu (EG *binda)	 	*band	 	*bundum	 	*bundan	 	'tie'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	(K)VLC	 	e/i	 	a	 	u (EG u/o)	 	o (EG u/o)	 	 
 	 	 	 	*werpu (EG *werpa)	 	*warp	 	*wurpum (EG *worpum)	 	*worpan	 	'throw'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Goth.	 	 	 	i	 	a	 	u	 	u	 	 
 	 	 	 	binda	 	band	 	bundum	 	bundans	 	'bind'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	aí [e]	 	a	 	aú [o]	 	aú [o]	 	 
 	 	 	 	waírpa	 	warp	 	waúrpum	 	waúrpans	 	'throw'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In the above, R stands for any resonant l,r,m,n. N stands only for the nasals of this set m,n, while L stands for the non-nasals l,r. The resulting ablaut pattern characterizing the third strong conjugation in Gothic thus falls into two groups.

Class	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.
IIIa	 	i	 	a	 	u	 	u
IIIb	 	aí [e]	 	a	 	aú [o]	 	aú [o]
The difference in ablaut patterns is conditioned by the consonant following the vowel. In the present, the e generally changes to i, except when followed by a non-nasal resonant. Likewise in the past plural and past participle, u generally appears, except when replaced by aú [o] before a non-nasal resonant.

The verb binda 'bind', with prinicpal parts binda -- band -- bundum -- bundans, serves to illustrate the forms of the third conjugation. The forms are as follows.

27 The Fourth Strong Conjugation
The fourth strong conjugation comprises verbs whose root ends in a single resonant l,r,m,n. The historical evolution of these verbs is shown in the chart below.

Class IV	 	Root Shape	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning

 	 	 	 	*bhérō	 	*bhóra	 	*bhērmé	 	*bhrón	 	'carry'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PGmc	 	(K)VR	 	e/i	 	a	 	ē	 	o (EG o/u)	 	 
 	 	 	 	*beru (EG *bera)	 	*bar	 	*bērum	 	*boran	 	'carry'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Goth.	 	 	 	i / aí [e]	 	a	 	ē	 	u / aú [o]	 	 
 	 	 	 	qima	 	qam	 	qēmum	 	qumans	 	'come'
 	 	 	 	baíra	 	bar	 	bērum	 	baúrans	 	'bear'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In the above, R stands for any resonant l,r,m,n. The resulting ablaut pattern characterizing the third strong conjugation in Gothic thus becomes the following.

Class	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.
IVa	 	i	 	a	 	ē	 	u
IVb	 	aí [e]	 	a	 	ē	 	aú [o]
The difference between Classes IVa and IVb lies in the vowels of the present system and of the past participle stems.

The verbs brikan 'break' and trudan 'tread' follow the ablaut pattern of the fourth class though their roots do not end in a resonant.

The verb baíran 'bear, carry', with prinicpal parts baíra -- bar -- bērum -- baúrans, serves to illustrate the forms of the fourth conjugation. The forms are as follows.

28 The Nominative Case
The nominative case is the case of the subject of a finite verb. If the verb is such that its meaning equates predicate to subject -- e.g. be, become, seem, appear -- then the predicate also takes the nominative case. For example, ik im sō usstass jah libáins 'I am the resurrection and the life' (John 11.25); jah was drus is mikils 'and the fall of it was great' (Matthew 8.27); ni ei weis gakusanái þugkáima 'not that we should appear approved' (II Corinthians 13.7). Similarly, if a passive verb is such that it equates predicate to subject -- e.g. be named, be called, be considered, be deemed, be made -- then the predicate takes the nominative case. For example, ni þatei... ju garaíhts gadōmiþs sijáu 'not as though... I were already deemed right' (Philippians 3.12); gasatiþs im ik mērjans 'I am ordained a preacher' (I Timothy 2.7).

With verbs meaning name or call, Gothic often employs the nominative where one might otherwise expect the accusative or another oblique case. For example, jah gasatida Seimōna namō Paítrus 'And Simon he surnamed Peter' (Mark 3.16), where the Greek employs the accusative; fram þizái namnidōn bimáit in leika handuwaúrht 'by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands' (Ephesians 2.11), where þizái namnidōn is a dative expression modifying the nominative bimáit... handuwaúrht, though in the Greek noun and modifiers are all in the same case. The verbs wisan 'be' and waírþan 'become' often employ the preposition du with the dative in place of a predicate nominative.

The nominative case is used in one, possibly two, instances for an absolute construction. In these constructions, a noun is paired with a past participle and forms a unit grammatically distinct (absolute) from the remaining constructions of the sentence. Such absolute constructions are generally in the dative, and sometimes in the accusative, case in Gothic. However in some instances such pairings occur in the nominative, though the noun so modified is not the apparent subject of the finite verb of the main clause. The clearest example is jah waúrþans dags gatils, þan Herodis mela gabaúrþáis seináizōs nahtamat waúrhta 'And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper...', more literally 'and a convenient day having come,...' (Mark 6.21). Another possible instance is urrann sa dáuþa gabundans handuns jah fotuns faskjam jah wlits is auralja bibundans 'And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin', literally 'and his face bound about...' (John 11.44). This last phrase, however, translates a Greek finite verb form peridédeto, and may therefore be an instance of an omitted copula.

29 The Accusative Case
The direct object of a transitive verb, finite or non-finite, is placed in the accusative case. For example, aþþan ik in watin izwis dáupja 'I indeed baptize you with water' (Matthew 3.11); jabái áuk frijōþ þans frijōndans izwis áinans, ƕō mizdōnō habáiþ? 'For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?', more literally 'For if ye love those loving you alone, what of rewards have ye?' (Matthew 5.46). Note in the last example that þans frijōndans is the accusative object of the finite form frijōþ, while izwis áinans is the accusative object of the participle frijōndans.

Certain impersonal verbal constructions take the accusative. The verbs grēdōn 'be greedy, hungry', huggrjan 'hunger', þaúrsjan 'thirst' take the accusative of the person affected. For example, jabái grēdō fijand þeinana, mat gif imma 'if thine enemy hunger, give him food', literally 'if it hunger thine enemy' (Romans 12.20); þana gaggandan du mis ni huggreiþ, jah þana galáubjandan du mis ni þaúrseiþ ƕanhun 'he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst', more literally 'it shall never hunger one coming to me; and it shall never thirst one believing in me' (John 6.35). The phrase kar' ist or kara 'it concerns' takes the accusative of the person and genitive of the thing. For example, jah ni kar' ist ina þizē lambē 'and careth not for the sheep', literally 'it concerns him not of the sheep' (John 10.13). The phrase skula wisan 'be guilty, be debtor' takes an accusative of the thing owed: aflēt uns þatei skulans sijáima 'forgive us our debts', literally 'forgive us that which we owe' (Matthew 6.12).

Occasionally either transitive or intransitive verbs may take an internal or cognate accusative. An internal accusative is any direct object reiterating or specifying the basic meaning of the verb; a cognate accusative futher stipulates that the noun in the accusative be cognate with the verb itself. Consider the following examples: ei waúrkjáima waúrstwa guþs 'that we might work the works of God' (John 6.28); háifst þō gōdōn háifstida 'I have fought a good fight' (II Timothy 4.7); jah ōhtēdun sis agis mikil 'and they feared exceedingly', literally 'and they feared a great fear' (Mark 4.41); náiteinōs, swa managōs swaswē wajamērjand 'and blasphemes wherewith soever they shall blaspheme', literally 'and blasphemes, as many as they shall blaspheme' (Mark 3.28).

Some verbs in Gothic take a double accusative. The following are some situations in which this occurs:

(1) Personal Object + Predicate: Examples are sō sunja frijans izwis briggiþ 'the truth shall make you free' (John 8.32); þanzei jah apaústuluns namnida 'whom also he named apostles' (Luke 6.13); motarjōs garaíhtana domidēdun guþ 'the publicans justified God', literally 'the publicans deemed God right' (Luke 7.29).

(2) Personal Object + Internal Accusative: Examples are ƕa áuk bōteiþ mannan 'for what shall it profit a man' (Mark 8.36); láisida ins in gajukōm manag 'he taught them many things by parables' (Mark 4.2). There are other examples that may be considered as belonging to the category discussed next.

(3) Personal + Material Object: Some examples overlap with the category above. Examples are sa izwis láiseiþ allata 'he shall teach you all (things)' (John 14.26); wileima ei þatei þuk bidjōs táujáis uggkis 'we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire', literally '...whatsoever we shall ask thee' (Mark 10.35).

Viewed more generally, the accusative denotes extent in time or space, usually leading to some eventual endpoint or terminus. A few examples are alla naht þaírharbáidjandans 'having toiled all night' (Luke 5.5); jah qinō wisandei in runa blōþis jēra twalif 'And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years' (Luke 8.43); manag áuk mēl frawalw ina 'for many a time it had caught him' (Luke 8.29); qēmun dagis wig 'they went a day's journey' (Luke 2.44); jah jabái ƕaw þuk ananáuþjái rasta áina, gaggáis miþ imma twōs 'and if anyone compel thee (to go) one mile, go with him two' (Matthew 5.41).

Related to the above notion of extent is the so-called accusative of specification, or in the terminology of the classical languages, the accusative or respect. The accusative may be used to limit the scope of the surrounding semantic environment. Consider the following examples: jah urrann sa dáuþa gabundans handuns jah fotuns faskjam 'and the dead man came forth, bound hands and feet with bandages' (John 11.44); standáiþ nu uf gaúrdanái hupins izwarans sunjái 'stand therefore, girt (about) your loins with truth' (Ephesians 6.14).

The accusative, like the more typical dative and very rarely the nominative, is used in absolute constructions. In this, a noun or pronoun together with a particple form a phrase grammatically distinct from the main clause, but are together taken as nearly equivalent in sense to a clause with a finite verb. Consider the following: iþ þuk táujandan armaiōn ni witi hleidumei þeina, ƕa táujiþtaíhswo þeina 'But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth', more literally 'you doing alms, let not...' (Matthew 6.3). This accusative construction translates a genitive absolute in the Greek text, as does the accusative construction in the next example: jah atgaggandein inn daúhtar Herodiadins jah plinsjandein jah galeikandein Heroda jah þáim miþanakumbjandam, qaþ þiudans du þizái máujái 'And when the daughter of the (said) Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel', literally 'the daughter... coming in, and dancing, and pleasing..., the king said...' (Mark 6.22).

30 The Infinitive
30.1 Uses of the Infinitive
The infinitive may appear as subject of a clause. In such circumstances the infinitive may stand alone, be accompanied by the preposition du, or be modified by the article þata. Consider the following examples: ƕáiwa aglu ist þáim hugjandam afar faíháu in þiudangardja guþs galeiþan 'how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God' (Mark 10.24); iþ þata du sitan af taíhswō meinái aíþþáu af hleidumein nist mein du giban 'But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give' (Mark 10.40); ƕa ist þata us dáuþáim usstandan 'what the rising from the dead is' (Mark 9.10).

The infinitive may appear as object of another verb. The infinitive is often complementary to the governing verb, taking the same subject. For example, jah sōkidēdun ina undgreipan 'And they sought to lay hold on him' (Mark 12.12); untē ni magt áin tagl ƕeit aíþþáu swart gatáujan 'because thou canst not make one hair white or black' (Matthew 5.36); jah gahaíháitun imma faíhu giban 'and promised to give him money' (Mark 14.11).

A complementary infinitive may also occur with adjectives or nouns. For example, manwus im qiman at izwis 'I am ready to come to you' (II Corinthians 12.14); lustu habands andlētnan jah miþ Xristáu wisan 'having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ' (Philippians 1.23).

The infinitive may be used to express purpose. This often occurs in conjunction with verbs of motion. The infinitive may stand alone, or it may follow the preposition du. Consider the following examples: jah gagga káusjan þans 'and I go to prove them' (Luke 14.19); ni qam gataíran ak usfulljan 'I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil' (Matthew 5.17); sái urrann sa saiands du saian fráiwa seinamma 'Behold, there went out a sower to sow his seed' (Mark 4.3).

The infinitive may be used with the conjunctions swaswē and swaei to express result. The subject of such an infinitive generally takes the accusative case. For example, jah sái wēgs mikils warþ in marein, swaswē þata skip gahuliþ waírþan fram wēgim 'And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves', literally '... so as for the ship to become covered...' (Matthew 8.24); jah galēsun sik du imma manageins filu, swaswē ina galeiþandan in skip gasitan in marein 'and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea', literally '... so as for him entering ... to sit...' (Mark 4.1); ganah þamma swaleikamma andabeit þata fram managizam, swaei þata andaneiþō izwis máis fragiban jah gaþláihan 'Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him', literally '... so as for you... to forgive... and to comfort...' (II Corinthians 2.6-7).

30.2 Use of Cases with the Infinitive
The subject of an infinitive generally takes the accusative case. The accusative with infinitive is often equivalent to a clause with finite verb in Modern English. Such a construction may stand as object of a verb, as in the following examples: in þizei háusidēduþ ina siukan 'because that ye had heard that he had been sick', literally '... had heard him to be sick' (Philippians 2.26); ƕana qiþand mik mans wisan 'Whom do men say that I am', literally 'Whom do men say me to be' (Mark 8.27). An accusative and infinitive construction may also stand as the subject of a verb: jah warþ afsláuþnan allans 'and it happened that they were all amazed', literally 'and (for) them to be amazed happened' (Luke 4.36); iþ azētizō ist himin jah aírþa hindarleiþan þáu witōdis áinana writ gadriusan 'And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail' (Luke 16.17).

The subject of an infinitive may also take the dative case. This generally occurs when the infinitive is itself the subject of the clause. For example, gōþ þus ist hamfamma in libáin galeiþan, þáu twos handuns habandin galeiþan 'it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell' (Mark 9.43); jah warþ þaírhgaggan imma sabbatō daga þaírh atisk 'And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day', literally 'and it happened for him to go...' (Mark 2.23). Note also ƕáiwa aglu ist þáim hugjandam afar faíháu in þiudangardja guþs galeiþan 'how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God' (Mark 10.24), quoted in the previous section.

Lesson 7
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Christianity among the Goths
Our major document in the Gothic language is a translation of the Christian Bible. But this translation gives no information as to how Christianity was received by the Goths. Ultimately it is clear that Christianity took hold among the Gothic tribes, but to see its development in the early stages after the mission of Wulfila (Ulfila), we must have recourse to other historical documents.

The Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen
Sozomen was a church historian of the 5th century. His work the Ecclesiastical History was likely dependent on the works of several predecessors, in particular the historians Socrates, Eunapius, and Philostorgius. According to Sozomen, the attacks of the Huns led the Goths to send an embassy to the Roman emperor, asking permission to resettle in Roman territory in return for fighting alongside the Romans when the need arose: the leader of this embassy, Sozomen records, was Wulfila. Subsequent events resulted in a division among the Goths, the two major groups led by Athanaric and Fritigern, respectively. As the two fought each other, Fritigern asked the Roman emperor Valens for assistance. In Thrace the combined forces of Fritigern's Goths and Valens' Roman legions defeated Athanric. Out of gratitude for his aid, Fritigern offered to adopt the emperor's religion, and ordered those under his rule to adopt Christianity as well.

It seems however that Gothic adoption of Christianity was not unanimously supported. The passage below describes the trials which befell the Christians during the time period shortly after Fritigern's conversion (translated in Heather and Matthews, 1991):

 	 	At that time, there were many among the subjects of Fritigern who bore witness through Christ and suffered death. Athanaric was annoyed that those under his power also had been persuaded by Ulphilas to become Christians, and subjected many of them to many forms of punishment because the ancestral religion was threatened by innovation...
It seems that Athanaric was determined to undermine the authority of Fritigern after suffering a defeat at his hands. But in a more general perspective, a reiks such as Athanaric was charged to uphold older traditions, so that the Christians were felt to be a challenge to the authority of the reiks. Sozomen continues:

 	 	It is said that a wooden image was placed on a wagon, and that those instructed by Athanaric to undertake this task wheeled it round to the tent of any of those who were denounced as Christians and ordered them to do homage and sacrifice to it; and the tents of those who refused to do so were burned, with the people inside.
 	 	 
 	 	And I have heard that an even more dreadful suffering than this occurred, when a large number of Christians who refused to yield to attempts to compel them to sacrifice by force, took refuge in the tent which formed their church in that place, and all -- men and women also, some of whom led their little children by the hand, others with new-born babies feeding at the breast -- were destroyed when the pagans set fire to it.
The Passion of St. Saba the Goth
Another text crucial to our understanding of the Gothic reception of Christianity is the Passion of St. Saba the Goth. The text survives in 10th century manuscripts, but the story itself dates the martyrdom of St. Saba to April 12, 372 AD. The story tells us that Saba was a Goth living in Gothic territory, and had been a Christian since childhood. He had no possessions except for the bare necessities.

As the story goes, Christians were compelled to eat flesh sacrificed according to Gothic tribal customs, and therefore unclean to Christians. At the level of the village, it seems that Christianity could be tolerated, as long as it was not practiced overtly (translated sections are quoted from Heather and Matthews, 1991):

 	 	[W]hen the chief men in Gothia began to be moved against the Christians, compelling them to eat sacrificial meat, it occurred to some of the pagans in the village in which Saba lived to make the Christians who belonged to them eat publicly before the persecutors meat that had not been sacrificed in place of that which had, hoping thereby to preserve the innocence of their own people and at the same time to deceive the persecutors. Learning this, the blessed Saba not only himself refused to touch the forbidden meat but advanced into the midst of the gathering and bore witness, saying to everyone, 'If anyone eats of that meat, this man cannot be a Christian', and he prevented them all from falling into the Devil's snare. For this, the men who had devised the deception threw him out of the village, but after some time allowed him to return.
Saba was banished for his vehement espousal of Christianity, since being so outspoken over such matters threatened to upset the traditional social order of the village.

Saba eventually returned. Later, when a reiks visited from elsewhere, village nobles attempted to conceal the fact that any Christians lived in the village, since such village members would be an affront to the authority of the reiks. Saba would not conceal his beliefs and spoke out, whereupon the village elders protected other Christians by saying that Saba was the only one in the village. The reiks mocked Saba for his poverty, and again Saba was cast out.

Later Saba, along with a prebyter Sansalas, was taken captive by a gang under the leadership of Atharid. They tortured Saba late into the night and then left him. He was freed by a slave woman, but he refused to flee. He was bound again and cursed Atharid, who subsequently ordered him to be put to death. The story continues:

 	 	Those appointed to perform this lawless act left the presbyter Sansalas in bonds, and took hold of Saba and led him away to drown him in the river called the Mousaios.... When they came to the banks of the river, his guards said to one another, 'Come now, let us set free this fool. How will Atharidus ever find out?' But the blessed Saba said to them, 'Why do you waste time talking nonsense and not do what you were told to?...' Then they took him down to the water, still thanking and glorifying God..., threw him in and, pressing a beam against his neck, pushed him to the bottom and held him there.
So died Saba, though subverting at every moment the attempts of others to help him. It thus appears that none at the village level were involved in the decision-making process for the kuni, under the direction of the reiks. At this lower level, Christianity was tolerated, and converted relatives and friends were concealed and assisted by their fellow villagers and family members. It was apparently at the level of the kuni and the reiks that Christianity threatened the socio-political order, and it was from this level that persecution was enacted.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is Mark 9:2-13, the Transfiguration. We find in Mark 9.4 an example of a periphrastic construction showing progressive aspect: wēsun rōdjandans 'they were talking'. Though this parallels the Greek ēsan sullalountes, it seems that it was a natural construction within Germanic, as the Modern English translation illustrates. Though Old English texts are only attested much later than the Gothic Bible, such a construction is nevertheless as old as Beowulf itself: Swa se secg hwata secggende wæs laðra spella 'So was the valiant warrior speaking of terrible tales' (B.3028).

In Mark 9.5 we find the word hlijans 'tabernacles'. This word only appears here, in the accusative plural. The Proto-Germanic antecedent *hle-wa- gives Old Norse hlé, Old English hlēo, Old Frisian hlī, Old Saxon hleo, all meaning 'protection'. This even finds its way into Modern English nautical jargon: lee(ward).

Mark 9.9 gives an illustration of what, in grammars of the classical languages Greek and Latin, is typically termed the sequence of tenses: anabáuþ im ei mannhun ni spillōdēdeina 'he charged them that they should tell no man'. The direct command would have employed a present subjunctive or imperative. However when the indirect command is introduced by a past tense verb, the present subjunctive or imperative is rendered by a past subjunctive. A similar situation occurs in Modern English: the future tense in 'He will go home' is restructured as a past subjunctive (or really a past tense of the present 'will') when subordinate to a past tense main verb, as in 'He said that he would go home.'

Translation
From the King James version:
9:2 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. 3 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. 4 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. 7 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 8 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
9 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. 10 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean. 11 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? 12 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. 13 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.
Grammar
31 The Fifth Strong Conjugation
The fifth strong conjugation comprises verbs whose roots end in a single non-resonant consonant (i.e. not l,r,m,n). The historical evolution of these verbs is shown in the chart below.

Class V	 	Root Shape	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PIE	 	(K)VT	 	e	 	o	 	ē	 	e	 	 
 	 	 	 	*ghébhō	 	*ghóbha	 	*ghēbhmé	 	*ghebhón	 	'give'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PGmc	 	(K)VT	 	e/i	 	a	 	ē	 	e (EG i/e)	 	 
 	 	 	 	*ḡevu (EG *ḡiva)	 	*ḡav	 	*ḡēvum	 	*ḡevan (EG *ḡivan)	 	'give'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Goth.	 	 	 	i / aí [e]	 	a	 	ē	 	i / aí [e]	 	 
 	 	 	 	giba	 	gaf	 	gēbum	 	gibans	 	'give'
 	 	 	 	saíƕa	 	saƕ	 	sēƕum	 	saíƕans	 	'see'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In the above, T stands for any non-resonant, that is any consonant other than l,r,m,n. The resulting ablaut pattern characterizing the fifth strong conjugation in Gothic thus becomes the following.

Class	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.
Va	 	i	 	a	 	ē	 	i
Vb	 	aí [e]	 	a	 	ē	 	aí [e]
The difference between classes Va and Vb lies in the vowel of the present stem and the past participle. The change is conditioned by the consonant following the vowel. Generally the vowel i occurs, but this is replaced by aí [e] when followed by h or ƕ. Hence giba, but saíƕa.

The verb sniwan 'hasten' belongs to the class Va, with final root consonant w. When this becomes word-final, the w shifts to u (i.e. aw becomes áu). The verb bidjan 'pray' conjugates according to the pattern of class Va, but the j-augment remains only in the forms built from the present stem. The verb fraíhnan 'inquire' conjugates according to the pattern of class Vb, but the n-suffix remains only in the forms built from the present stem. The principal parts of these verbs are as follows.

Class	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Va	 	sniwa	 	snáu	 	snēwum	 	-	 	'hasten'
 	 	bidja	 	baþ	 	bēdum	 	bidans	 	'pray'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Vb	 	fraíhna	 	frah	 	frēhum	 	fraíhans	 	'inquire'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The verb giba 'give', with prinicpal parts giba -- gaf -- gēbum -- gibans, serves to illustrate the forms of the fifth conjugation. The forms are as follows.

Class V	 	Active	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive

Note the second person singular, present imperative active form bidei: the word final j-augment becomes vocalic, giving ei [ī]. The present forms of bidjan parallel those of verbs of the first weak conjugation. The (present) mediopassive forms are constructed analogously. In the finite past forms, the j-augment and the n-suffix do not appear, the conjugations following giba in all respects. The w of sniwan, when word-final, combines with the preceding a to yield the diphthong áu.

32 The Sixth Strong Conjugation
The sixth strong conjugation comprises verbs whose roots end in at most a single consonant. The historical evolution of these verbs is shown in the chart below.

Class VI	 	Root Shape	 	Present	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning

 	 	 	 	fara	 	fōr	 	fōrum	 	farans	 	'travel'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In the above, K stands for any sequence of consonants, C for a single consonant. The resulting ablaut pattern characterizing the sixth strong conjugation in Gothic thus becomes the following.

Some verbs of class VI, such as the verb fraþjan 'understand', have a j-augment which remains only in forms built from the present stem. The class VI verb standan 'stand' has an n-infix which remains only in forms built from the present stem, cf. English stand vs. stood. The principal parts of these verbs are as follows.

Note the second person singular, present imperative active form fraþei: the word final j-augment becomes vocalic, giving ei [ī]. The present forms of fraþjan parallel those of verbs of the first weak conjugation. The (present) mediopassive forms are constructed in a similar fashion. In the finite past forms, the j-augment and the n-infix do not appear, the conjugations following saka in all respects.

33 The Genitive Case
The genitive case eludes concise description. In its most general sense, it is a case denoting relation of one sort or another. The typical nature of such relation is possession, as in Modern English 'Lincoln's hat'. But certain relations defy such characterization, such as 'Lincoln's presidency'. The genitive may denote the logical subject of the action which the head noun represents: 'Lincoln's death'. On the other hand, the genitive may express the logical object of the action which the head noun represents: 'Lincoln's assassination'. This broad range encompassed by the genitive in English is paralleled in Gothic.

The partitive genitive, as its name denotes, identifies the whole of which a part is specified. Take for example þái þiudō 'those of the publicans, the publicans' (Matthew 5.46); in þōei baúrgē 'in whichever of cities, in whichever city' (Luke 10.8); ƕas izwara 'which of you' (Matthew 6.27); manageins filu 'much of a multitude, a great multitude' (Mark 9.14); halbata áiginis meinis 'half of my goods' (Luke 19.8). As illustrated in some of the preceding examples, this is particularly common with expressions denoting definite or indefinite number: sumái þizē bōkarjē 'some of the scribes' (Matthew 9.3); qinōnō suma 'a certain one of women, a certain woman' (Mark 5.25); áina anabusnē þizō ministōnō 'one of these least commandments' (Matthew 5.19); twans sipōnjē seináizē 'two of his disciples' (Matthew 8.21). This construction is occasionally replaced by the preposition us followed by the dative: sumans us im 'some from (among) them, some of them' (Romans 11.14); us þáim reikam managái 'many from (among) the rulers, many of the rulers' (John 12.42). The preposition in with dative is also found: sumái in izwis 'some among you, some of you' (I Corinthians 15.12).

The genitive may denote characteristic or measure. For example some uses of the genitive denoting measure are the following: dagis wig 'a day's journey' (Luke 2.44); was áuk jērē twalibē 'she was of (the age of) twelve years' (Mark 5.42). Such uses may specify composition, marking what the head noun consists of or is made from. For example, stikla watins 'a cup of water' (Mark 9.41); hiuhma siponjē is 'a company of his disciples' (Luke 6.17). Constructions denoting characteristic often employ adjectives rather than a noun in the genitive: in spildom stáineináim 'in tables of stone, in stone tables' (II Corinthians 3.3); ni sind þatáinei kasa gulþeina jah silubreina, ak jah triweina jah digana 'there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth', literally 'golden vessels...', etc. (II Timothy 2.20).

The genitive frequently complements adjectives. Certain adjectives have their meaning completed or further specified by a noun or pronoun in the genitive. For example, weihs fráujins 'holy to the Lord', literally 'holy of the Lord' (Luke 2.23); waírþaba fráujins 'worthy of the Lord' (Colossians 1.10); skula waírþiþ leikis jah blōþis fráujins 'shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord' (I Corinthians 11.27); inwitōþs Xristáus 'under the law to Christ', literally 'in-law of Christ' (I Corinthians 9.21). Possessive adjectives regularly substitute for their corresponding personal pronouns in the genitive: meina waírþs 'worthy of me', but literally 'my worthy', or more historically 'mine worthy' (Matthew 10.37).

The genitive occasionally adopts the roles of either instrumental or ablative. For example, frija ist þis witōdis 'she is free from the law', literally 'free of the law' (Romans 7.3); framaþjái libáináis guþs 'alienated from the life of God' (Ephesians 4.18); fullōs gabrukō 'full of fragments' (Mark 8.19).

The genitive may be used independently of any head noun to specify time or place. Such uses of the genitive often have adverbial force in English. For example, jah was fraquman dagis ƕizuh stiur .a. 'Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox' (Nehemiah 5.18); witandans wahtwōm nahts 'keeping watch by night' (Luke 2.8); framwigis gif unsis þana hláif 'evermore give us this bread' (John 6.34). Uses of the genitive in reference to place often denote the goal of an action: manna sums gaggida landis 'A certain (noble)man went into a (far) country' (Luke 19.12); usleiþam jáinis stadis 'Let us pass over unto the other side' (Mark 4.35).

Some adjectives have forms frozen in the genitive as common adverbs, e.g. filáus 'much'; allis 'at all, wholly, indeed'; raíhtis 'indeed'.

The genitive regularly accompanies certain verbs. The genitive is often used as predicate after wisan 'to be' or waírþan 'to become' to show possession, partition, or membership. For example, Xristáus sijuþ 'ye belong to Christ', literally 'ye are of Christ' (Mark 9.41); ƕarjis þizē waírþiþ qēns 'she is the wife of which of them?' (Luke 20.33); jah þu þizē is 'you also art (one) of them' (Matthew 26.73). When a verb does not act over its object entirely, the object may be in the genitive: ei... nēmi akranis 'that he might receive... of the fruit' (Mark 12.2); allái áinis hláibis jah áinis stiklis brūkjam 'we all partake of one bread and of one cup' (I Corinthians 10.17); jah swa þis hláibis matjái jaþ þis stikils drigkái 'and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup' (I Corinthians 11.28). Some verbs referring to memory, perception, requesting, or desiring govern a genitive. For example, baþ þis leikis Iēsuis 'begged the body of Jesus' (Matthew 27.58); du lustōn izōs 'to lust after her' (Matthew 5.28); þáu anþarizuh beidáima 'or shall we expect another?' (Matthew 11.3); ƕas mag þis háusjōn 'who can hear (of) it?' (John 6.60); jah gamunda Paítrus waúrdis Iēsuis 'and Peter remembered the word of Jesus' (Matthew 26.75); ni faírweitjandam þizē gasaíƕananē ak þizē ungasaíƕananē 'While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen' (II Corinthians 4.18). Verbs meaning 'fill' are often accompanied by the genitive: jah swinþnōda ahmins fullnands jah handugeins 'waxed strong, becoming filled with spirit and wisdom', where the Greek has a dative ekrataiouto pneúmati 'waxed strong with spirit' for the first Gothic genitive (Luke 2.40); grēdagans gasōþida þiuþē 'he hath filled the hungry with good things' (Luke 1.53). Verbs meaning 'heal' or 'cleanse' may employ a genitive in an ablatival function: háiljan sik saúhtē seináizō 'to heal themselves of their diseases' (Luke 6.17); aþþáu jabái ƕas gahráinjái sik þizē 'if a man therefore purge himself from these' (II Timothy 2.21).

The genitive occasionally accompanies negation, a feature Gothic shares with Old Church Slavonic. That is, when a positive statement contains either an intransitive verb with nominative subject or a transitive verb with accusative object, the corresponding negative statement often changes the nominative or accusative to a genitive. Consider the following: ni was im barnē 'they had no child', literally 'not was to them of children' (Luke 1.7); ni was im rūmis 'there was no room for them' (Luke 2.7); in þizei ni habáida diupáizōs aírþōs 'because it had no depth of earth', literally '... it had not of deep earth' (Mark 4.5); jabái ƕis brōþar... barnē ni bileiþái 'and if someone's brother... should not leave children' (Mark 12.19); ni habandein wammē aíþþáu máilē aíþþáu ƕa swaleikáizē 'not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing' (Ephesians 5.27). As the phrase ƕa swaleikáizē 'any of such things' in the last example suggests, such genitives accompanying negation are generally explained as partitive genitives. That is, e.g., ni was im barnē is to be understood as 'there was not to them (any bit) of children'; similarly ni habáida diupáizōs aírþōs 'it did not have (a bit) of deep earth'. Such constructions would then parallel the use of ni waíhts 'no thing, no creature', but with waíhts omitted. For example, compare ni waíht bōtōs mis táujáu 'I do myself nothing of advantage' (I Corinthians 13.3). In English terms, this is akin to phrasing 'I don't want any of those' as 'I don't want... of those'.

34 The Dative Case
The dative case denotes the indirect object of an action, as in the Modern English 'he is giving a book to me'. More generally, the dative denotes the somewhat vaguely defined referent of an action or state, as in Modern English 'that does not bode well for me' or 'what's it to you?' The dative case in Gothic also subsumes many of the functions represented by the Ablative, Locative, and Instrumental cases in other Indo-European languages. These cases correspond approximately to the Modern English use of the prepositions 'from', 'in' or 'on', and 'with', respectively.

The following examples exhibit the use of the dative to denote reference in Gothic: liuhaþ du andhuleinái þiudōm 'a light for enlightenment to the gentiles' (Luke 2.32); saúrga meina alláim aíkklēsjōm 'my care for all (the) churches' (II Corinthians 11.28). This reference sometimes mixes with senses of possession or relation. This is particularly common after the verbs wisan 'to be' or waírþan 'to become'. Consider the following examples: jah ƕaþrō imma sunus ist? 'and whence is he his son?', literally 'and whence is he son to him?' (Mark 12.37); jah ni was im barnē 'and they had no children', literally 'and not was to them (of) children' (Luke 1.7); jah waírþiþ þus fahēds jah swēgniþa 'and thou shalt have joy and gladness', literally 'and there will be joy and gladness to you' (Luke 1.14); ei uns waírþái þata arbi 'that the inheritance may be ours', literally 'that the inheritance may be to us' (Luke 20.14). Note in the following example the alternation between genitive and dative: swaei frauja ist sa sunus mans jah þamma sabbatō 'Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath', literally 'therefore the son of man is lord also to the sabbath' (Mark 2.28). Greek, by contrast, employs the genitive in both phrases.

The following uses of the dative stem from its function as instrumental case:

dative of means or instrument: usually equivalent to 'with' or 'by (means of)' in English. For example, sumáiþ þan lōfam slōhun (ina) 'and others smote (him) with the palms of their hands' (Matthew 26.67); bláuþjandans waúrd guþs þizái anabusnái izwarái 'making void the word of God through your command' (Mark 7.13); ufgaúrdanái hupins izwarans sunjái jah gapáidōdái brunjōn garaíhteins 'girt about your loins with truth, and clothed with the breastplate of righteousness' (Ephesians 6.14).
dative of amount or price: for example, niu twái sparwans assarjáu bugjanda 'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?' (Matthew 10.29); waírþa galáubamma usbaúhtái sijuþ 'ye are bought with a costly price' (I Corinthians 7.23).
dative of accompaniment (sociative dative): such datives generally occur unaccompanied by a preposition only with the verbs wisan 'to be' and waírþan 'to become', and thus is often similar to the dative of reference or relation discussed above. Often, however, this is preceded by miþ, or used in conjunction with a verb prefixed with miþ- or ga-: ak jah gatewiþs fram aiklesjōm miþgasinþa uns miþ anstái þizái 'but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace', literally '...a traveling companion to us with this grace' (II Corinthians 8.19); jah galáistans waúrþun imma Seimōn jah þái miþ imma 'and Simon and those with him were followers to him' (Mark 1.36); miþskalkinōda mis 'he hath served with me' (Philippians 2.22); þatei miþ ni qam sipōnjam seináim Iēsus in þata skip 'that Jesus came not with his disciples into the ship' (John 6.22); ju gahōrinōda izái 'hath committed adultery with her already' (Matthew 5.28).
The following uses of the dative stem from its ablative or instrumental functions:

dative of separation: for example, afstandand sumái galáubeinái 'some shall depart from faith' (I Timothy 4.1); þammei ik háubiþ afmaímáit 'from whom I cut off the head' (Mark 6.16).
dative of cause: often overlaps with the dative of means. For example, ungaláubeinái usbruknōdēdun 'because of unbelief they were broken off' (Romans 11.20); aþþan anstái guþs im saei im 'But by the grace of God I am what I am'; iþ ik huhráu fraqistna 'and I perish with hunger' (Luke 15.17).
dative of manner: for example, swē in daga garēdaba gaggáima, ni gabaúram jah drugkaneim, ni ligram jah agláitjam, ni háifstái jah aljana 'Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying' (Romans 13.13); niu þamma samin ahmin iddjēdum, niu þáim samam láistim 'walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?' (II Corinthians 12.18).
dative of degree of difference: for example, ni waírhtái bōtida 'by nothing bettered' (Mark 5.26); man áuk ni waíhtái mik minizō gatáujan 'for I suppose myself to accomplish (things by) no whit less' (II Corinthians 11.5).
dative of comparison: used to denote the standard to which comparison is made. For example, swinþōza mis ist 'is mightier than me' (Matthew 3.11); managizō þáim 'more than these' (Matthew 5.37); handugōzei mannam 'wiser than men' (I Corinthians 1.25).
The following uses of the dative stem from its locative function:

location in space: occasionally used independently, but more often accompanied by a locative preposition or a verb compounded with such a preposition. For example, untē mis atist ubil 'for evil is present with me' (Romans 7.21); iþ áins sums þizē atstandandanē imma 'and one of them standing by him' (Mark 14.47); jah ufswōgjands ahmin seinamma 'and sighing deeply in his spirit' (Mark 8.12); du ganasjan þans gamalwidans haírtin 'to heal those broken in heart' (Luke 4.18).
location in time: for example, urreisiþ naht jah daga 'and rise night and day' (Mark 4.27); wratōdēdun þái birusjōs is jēra ƕammēh in Iaírusalēm 'Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover' (Luke 2.41); Hláif unsarana þana sinteinan gif uns himma daga 'Give us this day our daily bread' (Matthew 6.11); ni waírþái sa þlaúhs izwar wintráu '(that) your flight be not in the winter' (Mark 13.18).
As in other Germanic languages, certain verbs in Gothic use the dative to mark the direct object, leaving out the accusative altogether. Some such verbs may be grouped into general types:

physical perception: (at)tēkan 'to touch'; kukjan 'to kiss'; (ga)baírgan 'to hide, keep, preserve'; gáumjan 'to perceive, observe'; witan 'to watch'. For example, sei tēkiþ imma 'that touches him' (Luke 7.39); þammei kukjáu 'whomsoever I shall kiss' (Mark 14.44); ƕa gáumeis gramsta 'why beholdest thou the mote?' (Luke 6.41); witandans Iēsua 'watching Jesus' (Matthew 27.54).
disposition: (ga)tráuan 'to trust'; galáubjan 'to believe'; neiwan 'to be angry'; aljanōn 'to be jealous'. For example, jah galáubjam imma 'and we believe (in) him' (Matthew 27.42); iþ sō Herōdia náiw imma 'therefore this Herodias was angry with him' (Mark 6.19); iþ saei ufbrikiþ mis, ufbrikiþ þamma sandjandin mik 'and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me' (Luke 10.16).
injury: balwjan 'to plague'; qistjan 'to destroy'. For example, balwjan unsis 'to torment us' (Matthew 8.29); ni qam sáiwalōm qistjan ak nasjan 'is not come to destroy lives, but to save (them)' (Luke 9.56).
separation: these likely take the dative in its ablative function, e.g. ufarmunnōn 'to forget'; idweitjan 'to reproach'; sakan 'to rebuke'. For example, swēþáuh þáim afta ufarmunnōnds 'indeed forgetting those (things which are) behind' (Philippians 3.13).
A common construction in Gothic is the dative absolute. Such constructions employ a noun or pronoun combined with a participle to function as a self-contained clause. The noun and participle are placed in the dative (though occasionally the accusative, or even the nominative, is employed), and remain grammatically distinct (absolute) from the other elements of the sentence. For example, usleiþandin Iēsua in skipa aftra hinfar marein, gaqēmun sik manageins filu du imma 'and Jesus having passed over on a ship to the other side of the sea, there came to him a great multitude' (Mark 5.21). In other Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, such absolute constructions can refer only to entities completely grammatically absent from the remainder of the statement. The constructions in Gothic, however, are rarely so absolute. They frequently refer to someone or something which appears later in the statement, generally in the dative. For example, qimandin þan in garda duatiddjēdun imma þái blindans 'And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him' (Matthew 9.28). The Gothic dative absolute is often preceded by the preposition at: at andanahtja þan waúrþanamma atbērun du imma dáimōnarjans managans 'When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils' (Matthew 8.16); jah at Iēsu ufdáupidamma jah bidjandin, usluknōda himins 'Jesus also being baptized and praying, the heaven was opened' (Luke 3.21); at libandin abin 'while (her) husband liveth' (Romans 7.3).

35 The Conjunctions ei, þei, and þatei
The particle ei is a general relative particle, akin to Old Norse er. It has no definite meaning of its own, but serves to mark a pronoun or clause as relative. It combines as an enclitic with demonstrative pronouns to produce the associated relative, e.g. þata 'that (thing)' vs. þatei 'which (thing), (the thing) which'. When ei serves as a freestanding relative marker, it may introduce various types of temporal or substantive clauses. The following are some of the most common:

temporal clauses: For example, fram þamma daga ei háusidēdun 'since the day we heard it' (Colossians 1.9). The following example, however, denotes manner rather than time: aþþan þamma háidáu ei Jannis jah Mambrēs andstōþun Mōsēza 'For in the manner (in which = ei) Jannis and (J)ambres withstood Moses' (2 Timothy 3.8).
purpose clauses: In this function ei is generally followed by the subjunctive. For example, ƕaþrō bugjam hláibans, ei matjáina þái 'Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?' (John 6.5); frawardjand áuk andwaírþja seina, ei gasaíƕáindáu mannam fastandans 'for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast' (Matthew 6.16).
indirect commands or wishes: These likewise take the subjunctive. For example, wenja áuk ei þaírh bidōs izwarōs fragibáidáu izwis 'for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you' (Philemon 1.22); bidja du guda ei ni waíht ubilis táujáiþ 'Now I pray to God that ye do no evil' (II Corinthians 13.7); faúrbáud imma ei mann ni qēþi 'he charged him to tell no man', literally 'he charged that he not tell anyone' (Luke 5.14).
statements of belief: After verbs denoting 'believe' or 'trust', ei may introduce a substantive clause with a verb in the indicative, or occasionally in the subjunctive. For example, aþþan gatráuam in fráujin in izwis ei, þatei anabudum izwis, jah táujiþ jah táujan habáiþ 'And we have confidence in the Lord within you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you' (II Thessalonians 3.4); silbans tráuáidēdun sis ei wēseina garaíhtái '(certain which) trusted in themselves that they were righteous' (Luke 18.9).
indirect statement: In this function ei is generally followed by the indicative. For example, þu qiþis ei þiudans im ik 'you say that I am king' (John 18.37); swaswē qaþ du Iudaium ei þadei ik gagga jus ni maguþ qiman 'as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come' (John 13.33).
The particle þei functions as a relative marker similar to ei. Compare the Old English relative þe. There is one example of its use without nominal antecedent, in which it marks a temporal clause: ibái magun sunjus brūþfadis qáinōn und þata ƕeilōs þei miþ im ist brūþfaþs 'Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?' (Matthew 9.15). Frequently þei immediately follows an indefinite pronoun or adverb. For example, þataƕah þei wileiþ, bidjiþ 'ye shall ask what ye will' (John 15.7); þisƕaruh þei merjada sō aíwaggēljō 'Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached' (Mark 14.9); þisƕaduh þei gaggáiþ in gard 'In what place soever ye enter into an house' (Mark 6.10).

The particle þei, like ei, introduces purpose clauses, in which it is followed by the subjunctive. For example, þata rōdida izwis þei in mis gawaírþi áigeiþ 'These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace' (John 16.33). Compare the use of ei in the following: þata rōdida izwis, ei ni afmarzjáindáu 'These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended' (John 16.1). þei may likewise introduce indirect statement: qiþa þus þei hana ni hrukeiþ 'I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow' (John 13.38); qiþa izwis þei grētiþ 'I say unto you, That ye shall weep' (John 16.20).

The word þatei may occasionally function like ei, introducing substantive clauses denoting belief. As with ei, such clauses may have a verb in the indicative or subjunctive. For example, gatráujands in alláim izwis þatei meina fahēþs alláizē izwara ist 'having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all' (II Corinthians 2.3); gatráua áuk þatei ni dáuþus... magi uns afskáidan 'For I trust that neither death... may separate us' (Romans 8.39); ga-u-láubjats þatei magjáu þata táujan 'Believe ye that I am able to do this?' (John 9.18). Uses of þatei to introduce indirect commands or wishes are uncommon: fragibands im þatei sunjus þiudangardjōs waírþáina 'granting them that they become sons of the kingdom' (Skeireins 3.20). þatei may likewise introduce indirect statement: jah jabái qēþjáu þatei ni kunnjáu ina 'and if I should say, I know him not' (John 8.55).

Lesson 8
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Wulfila
Ulfila, also written Ulphilas in Greek texts, is the name of the bishop who devised an alphabet for the Gothic language and translated the Bible into Gothic in the mid-4th century AD. Based on the form in which it is written in Romance languages, as Vulphilas, Vulfila, or Gulphilas -- with an initial gu- signifying w- -- the name is probably more properly written Wulfila. The name itself is composed of the noun wulfs 'wolf' and the diminutive suffix -ila, the same kind of construction which forms the name of the most famous of the Huns, Attila < atta 'father' + ila (diminutive). It is not clear that the name 'little wolf' has any particular connotation in the case of the Biblical translator.

Most of what we know about Wulfila comes from two sources. One is a letter by Auxentius, a former student of Wulfila. The other is the Church History of Philostorgius, written sometime in the 5th century. Unfortunately this latter only survives in epitomized form, in the work of a 9th century scholar and patriarch of Constantinople by the name of Photius. This is brief enough that it is worth quoting in full (from Heather and Matthews, 1991):

 	 	(Philostorgius) says that at this time Ulphilas led a large body of the Scythians from those living across the Ister (the people whom in olden times they called Getae, but now call Goths) to the land of the Romans, driven through piety from their own homes. Now this people became Christian in the following way.
 	 	In the reigns of Valerian and Galleinus, a large number of Scythians from beyond the Ister crossed into Roman territory and overran much of Europe. Crossing into Asia, they reached as far as Galatia and Cappadocia. They took many prisoners, including some who were members of the clergy, and went home with a great quantity of booty.
 	 	Now the pious hand of prisoners, living as they did among the barbarians, converted many of them to the way of piety and persuaded them to adopt the Christian faith instead of the pagan. Among these prisoners were the ancestors of Ulphilas; they were Cappadocians by nationality, from a village near the city of Parnassus called Sadagolthina.
 	 	It was this Ulphilas who led the exodus of the pious ones, being the first bishop appointed among them. He was appointed in the following circumstances: sent with others by the ruler of the race of the Goths on an embassy in the time of Constantine (for the barbarian peoples in those parts owed allegiance to the emperor), Ulphilas was elected by Eusebius and the bishops of his party as bishop of the Christians in the Getic land.
 	 	Among the matters which he attended to among them, he was the inventor for them of their own letters, and translated all the Scriptures into their languages -- with the exception, that is, of Kings. This was because these books contain the history of wars, while the Gothic people, being lovers of war, were in need of something to restrain their passion for fighting rather than to incite them to it -- which those books have the power to do, for all that they are held in the highest honour, and are well fitted to lead believers to the worship of God.
 	 	The emperor established this mass of refugees in the territories of Moesia, where each man chose to live; and he held Ulphilas in the highest esteem, so as often to refer to him as the 'Moses of our time'. Philostorgius admires this man to excess, and records that with those in his charge he was attached to the same heretical opinions as himself.
Wulfila must have been consecrated bishop before 341, since in this year Eusebius of Nicomedia died. Wulfila subsequently went on a 7-year mission in Gothia, eventually leaving as a result of persecution. Assuming he was in fact consecrated in 341, and then left shortly thereafter on his mission, he would have left the Gothic lands in 347-348. This agrees with the timeline found in Auxentius. The historian Sozomen does in fact record something of Wulfila's impact on the Goths in his Ecclesiastical History (translated in Heather and Matthews, 1991):

 	 	In my opinion, however, this is not the only reason why the entire nation of the Goths is still to this day associated with the followers of Arius: there is also the influence of Ulphilas, who held the priestly office among them at that time.
 	 	At first, Ulphilas was in no respect at variance with the Catholic church, but in the reign of Constantius, in my opinion without considering the consequences, he joined the party of Eudoxius and Acacius at the council of Constantinople, while remaining in communion with the clergy of the party who had met at Nicaea.
 	 	But when he arrived at Constantinople, it is said theat there entered into discussion with him on questions of doctrine the leaders of the Arian heresy, who promised that they would lend their support to his embassy to the emperor if he adopted the same opinions as themselves; and that, compelled by his need -- or even genuinely believing it better to think of God in this way -- he entered communion with the supporters of Arius and, together with the entire people, split away from the Catholic church.
Auxentius was a student of Wulfila and later bishop of Durostorum (Silistra) on the Danube. His letter concerning his teacher is preserved in a scholia on the council of Aquileia in 381, written by the 5th century Arian theologian Maximinus. In the council itself, the Illyrian Arians, led by bishops Palladius of Ratiaria and Secundianus of Singidunum, were defeated by Ambrose of Milan, and Arian beliefs were thereby condemned.

To situate Wulfila in the proper theological setting of which he was a part, it is instructive to know something of the Arian debate which seized the church during this period. Arius was a Libyan theologian who lived c. 256-336 A.D. He denied that the Son was consubstantial with the Father, and thereby raised questions of the nature of the Trinity. The First Council of Nicea met in 325 to resolve this heresy, which seriously threatened the early church. As time passed and the debate continued, several revised opinions emerged. There were essentially four broad viewpoints:

homo-ousía, literally 'same-substance'. The homoousians (or homousians) maintained that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were of the same being or substance (ous/ia), none prior to the others. This was early espoused by Athanasius of Alexandria, then later by Basil of Caesarea and others.
homoi-ousía, literally 'similar-substance'. The homoiousians (or homoeusians) maintained that the members of the Trinity were cast from similar, but not, identical substance. The softening of tone allowed certain questions raised by homoousian doctrine to be passed over, specifically the question of what were in fact the differences in the members of the Trinity. The leader of this movement was Basil of Ancyra.
hómoios, literally 'similar'. The homoians (or homoeans) felt (1) that terms including ousía held no explanatory power, and (2) that the doctrine of the homoousians confused the members of the Trinity. This school was initiated by Eusebius of Nicomedia, then later taken up by the bishops Acacius of Caesarea and Eudoxius of Constantinople, and eventually supported by the Emperor Constantius.
an-(h)ómoios, literally 'dis-similar'. The anomoians (or anomoeans) were more assertive than the Arians, proposing that the Father and Son were in fact unlike one another, creating a true division within the Trinity. This movement gained ground sometime in the 350s, under the leadership of Aetius and Eunomius.
Wulfila for his part espoused the Arian doctrine, asserting a difference between the members of the Trinity, and further maintaining a disdain for the introduction of the term ousía into traditional creeds.

According to Auxentius, Wulfila also rejected the homoiousians, 'because he defended not comparable things but different dispositions'. It appears that Wulfila's primary concern with the members of the Trinity was not their actual substance, but rather the functions they fulfilled. There was an established order, in which the 'unbegotten' Supreme God (Father) produced the 'only-begotten' God (the Lord, or Christ, the Son), who was then in turn the creator of the physical and spiritual universe in the stead of the Father. This Second God had also produced the Holy Spirit as an intermediary between the mortal and divine world. Auxentius explains:

 	 	Now since there exists only one unbegotten God and there stands under him only one only-begotten God, the Holy Spirit our advocate can be called neither God nor Lord, but received its being from God through the Lord:... minister of Christ and distributor of acts of grace....
 	 	Steadfast in these and simlar doctrines, flourishing gloriously for forty years in the bishopric, [Ulfila] preached unceasingly with apostolic grace in the Greek, Latin and Gothic languages, in the one and only church of Christ....
In his letter Auxentius goes on to talk of the persecution that drove Wulfila from Gothia:

 	 	Then, through the envy and machinations of the Enemy a tyrannical and fearsome persecution of Christians in the barbarian land was aroused by the impious and sacrilegious 'iudex' of the Goths....
 	 	And then, after the glorious martyrdom of many servants and maidservants of Christ, with threats of persecution growing ever more intense, after completing just seven years in his episcopate the holy and blessed Ulfila, of whom we speak, was driven from the barbarian land with a great number of confessors and, still in the reign of Constantius of blessed memory, was received with honour on Roman soil.
 	 	And as God through Moses liberated his people from the power and violence of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, brought them across the seas and provided that they enter his service, so, through him whom we describe, God liberated from barbarian lands the confessors of his holy son the only-begotten, brought them across the Danube and had them serve him in the mountains, in imitation of the saints.
Wulfila was then not merely an obscure patriarch who chose a mission into the barbarian hinterland. Had the council at Aquileia in 381 not stamped out Arian beliefs, Wulfila may have gone on to be heralded as one of the great fathers of the church during this era. As events unfolded, however, his side did not carry the day; the steps taken later by the church, to erase documents espousing Arian attitudes, were so successful that we are in fact lucky to have any material on Wulfila at all.

Reading and Textual Analysis
It is uncertain whether the Gothic commentary on the Gospel of John, known as Skeireins (cf. ga-skeirjan 'make clear, interpret', related to skeinan 'shine' -- compare OE scīr and OHG schīr 'pure, sheer', as well as OE scīnan 'shine'), represents an original Gothic composition or merely a translation of a Greek or Latin original. Accepting Gothic as the original language of the text still leaves many questions of style and syntax unanswered. The text does not syntactically depart from the biblical translation in any significant way. This is perhaps only a chance occurrence due to the brevity of the surviving text. Given the genre, however, it is probably safe to suppose that the text was influenced by both Greek and Latin texts of similar character.

The Skeireins was probably composed sometime in the 5th century A.D. It was once argued that Wulfila was the author of this text as well as of the Bible translation, but this is now thought unlikely. The surviving portions of the work are recorded as a palimpsest on eight separate leaves of parchment, originally part of a single manuscript. The numbering convention used here, following Bennett's edition in The Gothic Commentary on the Gospel of John, designates each of the leaves with a Roman numeral (I-VIII) and the columns of text on each leaf with letters of the alphabet (a, b for recto and c, d for verso). The passage below, Skeireins IV c16 - d24, is of interest for providing us with a demonstration of the theological beliefs of the early Goths.

Translation
Translation from William Holmes Bennett (The Gothic Commentary on the Gospel of John, Modern Language Association of America: New York, 1960) --
But "He Who has come from heaven," even if He seemed to be in the flesh, nevertheless "is above all, and what He has seen and heard, that He testifies, and no man receives His testimony." And even though He came from heaven to earth for the plan concerning men, yet He was by no means earthly or speaking from the earth but born of heaven, transmitting the hidden things that He had seen and had heard from the Father. Now these matters were declared by John, not merely that he might proclaim the Lord's greatness, but to censure and rebuke that impious contention of Sabellius and Marcellus, who dared to say that the Father and the Son are one.
Grammar
36 The Seventh Strong Conjugation
The seventh strong conjugation marks a departure from the preterite formation of the other strong classes. Verbs of class VII form the past tense by means of reduplication, which may or may not be accompanied by ablaut in the root syllable. Reduplication denotes the prefixation to the root of the root's own initial consonant, followed by the vowel aí [e]. When the root lacks an initial consonant, only the vowel aí [e] appears. When the root begins with a consonant cluster, only the first consonant reduplicates -- unless the root begins with sk- or st-, whereby the entire cluster reduplicates. The historical evolution of these verbs is shown in the chart below.

The roots of class seven strong verbs do not possess a unique shape distinguishing them from verbs of other strong classes. The primary characteristic subdividing class VII itself is the presence or absence of root ablaut accompanying reduplication, as shown in the following chart.

Class VIIa verbs may contain any root vowel. The reduplicating vowel however is always e. In class VIIb, the root vowel is always [ē], written ai when it directly precedes another vowel.

The verb lēta 'let', with prinicpal parts lēta -- laílōt -- laílōtum -- lētans, serves to illustrate the forms of the seventh conjugation. The forms are as follows.

37 Weak Verbs and the First Weak Conjugation
37.1 Basic Formation of Weak Verbs
The weak verbs stand in contradistinction to strong verbs. Whereas strong verbs employ ablaut to mark the past tense, weak verbs employ a dental suffix -d/þ- (sometimes -t-) to mark the past forms. This formation distinguishes the Germanic family from other branches of Indo-European, as the dental preterite is found nowhere else.

Early investigations into its origin supposed that the dental suffix represents the second element of an original periphrastic formation involving the root *dhē 'put', akin to suggestions that the Latin imperfect represents a periphrastic construction employing the root *bhū 'become'. As with the Latin situation, the hypothesis suffers from a lack of conclusive evidence as to the precise nature of the original construction, e.g. as to what was the form of the first element of the periphrastic construction. Gothic, however, is unique in displaying in the plural a fuller form of the second element than one finds in other Germanic languages. Specifically, while the singular suffixes with their endings are the monosyllabic -da, -dēs, -da, the dual and plural forms are disyllabic: -dēd-u, -dēd-uts; -dēd-um, -dēd-uþ, -dēd-un. These forms are quite suggestive, in that they parallel the attested strong preterite forms of the root *dhē in other Germanic languages: Old High German tāt-um, tāt-ut, tāt-un; Old Saxon dād-un.

Another common thread of investigations into the origin of the dental preterite in Germanic has been its possible relation to the -t- of past participles in Germanic (e.g. Goth. nas-i-þ-s) and in other branches of Indo-European: Greek do-tó-s 'given'; Latin da-tu-s 'given'. A preterite form with this -t- suffix, such as PIE *kousitōm 'I heard' > PGmc *hauziðōm (EG *hausiðōm), might eventually be conflated in the Proto-Germanic period with PIE *dhōmi 'I put' > PGmc. *ðōm and reanalyzed as a compound form. Then by extension in Gothic the preterite plural forms of PIE *dhē, e.g. PGmc *ðēðum, would have been suffixed to fill out the rest of the paradigm.

Another possibility presents itself, one which does not suffer from the ambiguities of stem formation and analogy which are integral to the preceding theories. Benveniste early studied the use of the dh-determinatve in PIE, especially in the Greek and Indo-Iranian branches. Lehmann (1942, 1943) subsequently illustrated the connotations of this suffix within the Germanic family, and he proposed that this determinative is in fact the origin of the dental preterite. The dh-determinative, sometime in the period leading up to the split of Germanic from PIE, and then subsequently within PGmc, assumed a similar function in three basic situations:

with nouns derived from transitive roots: to denote past passive modification. For example, consider PIE *bher- 'cut' > Gothic fotu-baúrd 'foot-board', Old English bord; compare Greek perthō 'destroy', Latin ferīre 'strike', Old High German borōn 'bore'; PIE *mel- 'grind' > Gothic unmidljái (nom. pl. masc.) 'unkind', Old Icelandic mildr 'kind', Old English milde 'kind': the semantic development is evidently 'something that has been ground up' > 'something soft' > 'gentle, mild'. Compare Gothic malan 'grind', Latin molēre 'grind'. Also PIE *wer- 'speak' > Gothic waúrd 'word', Old Icelandic orð 'word', Old English word. Compare Latin verbum 'word', Greek eírō 'speak'. The dh-suffix denotes 'something that has been spoken'.
with nouns derived from intransitive roots: to denote modification caused by previous action. For example, consider PIE *gher- 'like', cf. Sanskrit háryati 'likes', Greek khaírō 'rejoice'. The dh-formant survives in Sanskrit grdhyati 'desires', Gothic gredáu (dat. sg. masc.) 'desire', Gothic gredags 'hungry', Old Icelandic gráðr 'hunger'. The semantics pass from 'liking' to the 'result of having liked continuing into the present', and hence 'desiring'. Consider also PIE *men- 'think'. This has a dh-extension PIE *mendh- 'turn one's attention to' > Gothic mundrōn 'turn one's attention to'; compare also Old High German muntar 'alert', Gothic mundrein (dat. sg. fem.) 'desire', resulting from the semantic association 'having turned one's attention towards' > 'alert'.
with verbs: to denote modification or change resulting from previous action. For example, consider PIE *(s)keu- 'cover' > Sanskrit skáuti 'covers'. The dh-extension yields Old English hȳdan 'hide, conceal', Greek keúthō 'conceal', as well as the nouns Gothic skauda-raip 'shoe-string', Old Icelandic skjóða 'sack', Middle High German schōte 'covering', Old Persian tigra-xauda 'with pointed cap'. These dh-forms show a semantic development 'to have covered' > 'hidden'. Consider also PIE *ar- 'fit' > Greek ararískō 'arrange', Latin rērī 'think'. The dh-extension gives Gothic undrēdan 'take care of', as well as Old Icelandic ráða, Old English rædan, Old Saxon rādan, all meaning 'give advice'. These show a semantic development 'fitting together, thinking' > 'having thought' > 'giving advice'. Note in addition PIE *wal- 'be strong' > Latin valēre 'be strong'. The dh-extension gives Gothic waldan, Old Icelandic valda, Old English wealdan, Old Saxon waldan, Old High German waltan, Lithuanian veldéti, all 'rule, possess'. The dh-determinative changes 'be strong' to 'have been strong' > 'rule, possess'.
The semantics of the dh-determinative are thus consonant with the eventual dental preterite. Specifically, while the PIE verbal system of aspect was still transparent, the dh-determinative signified a state reached by previous event. As this aspectual system gave way to a tense system, this dh-determinative would have become associated with past action much as the stative developed into the perfect in other branches of IE, such as Greek and Indo-Iranian. Another distinctive feature commending this theory is the simple fact that it takes the elusive nature of the ending of the first periphrastic element at face value: there was none. The original formation is not V1+V2, but rather the typical PIE formation of R+S+E, that is root-suffix-ending.

By the period of the documented Germanic languages the weak verbs are a self-standing pillar of the verbal system. Across the rest of the Germanic languages, these verbs fall into three classes, stemming from the respective suffixation of PIE *-j- > PGmc *-j/ij-, PIE *-ā- > PGmc *-ō-, or PIE *-oi- > PGmc *-ai- to the verbal root. Gothic possesses a fourth class characterized by the suffix PIE *-nō- > PGmc *-nā-. Verbs formed in this manner are found in other Germanic languages, e.g. Old Norse vakna and Old English wæcnian 'awake', but they are not numerous enough to form a class by themselves. In terms of preterite morphology, these verbs conjugate according to the PIE *-ā- > PGmc *-ō- class. Gothic thus possesses the following weak verb classes, usually distinguished in grammars by the form of the infinitive.

Weak Class	 	Infinitive	 	Past 1/3 Sg.	 	Past 1 Pl.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
i	 	nas-jan	 	nasida	 	nasidēdum	 	nasiþs	 	'save'
ii	 	salb-ōn	 	salbōda	 	salbōdēdum	 	salbōþs	 	'anoint'
iii	 	hab-an	 	habáida	 	habáidēdum	 	habáiþs	 	'have'
iv	 	full-nan	 	fullnōda	 	fullnōdēdum	 	-	 	'become full'
Four forms are given above merely for the sake of comparison with strong verbs. Such a list of forms is not however necessary, as it is for the strong verbs, since the forms of weak verbs are predictable once the infinitive is given.

37.2 The First Weak Conjugation
The first weak conjugation is characterized by the suffix PIE *-j- > PGmc *-i/ij- added to the verbal root. These verbs are typically either causative or denominative. Consider the following examples:

 	 	Strong Infin.	 	Past 3 Sg	 	Meaning	 	Strong Class	 	Weak i Infin.	 	Meaning
Causative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	drigkan	 	dragk	 	'drink'	 	III	 	dragkjan	 	'give to drink'
 	 	ligan	 	lag	 	'lie, recline'	 	V	 	lagjan	 	'make recline, lay'
 	 	ga-nisan	 	ga-nas	 	'be saved'	 	V	 	ga-nasjan	 	'save'
 	 	ur-reisan	 	ur-ráis	 	'arise'	 	I	 	ur-ráisjan	 	'raise'
 	 	sitan	 	sat	 	'sit'	 	V	 	satjan	 	'set'
 	 	sliupan	 	sláup	 	'slip'	 	II	 	af-sláupjan	 	'put off'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Nominative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Denominative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	diups	 	 	 	'deep'	 	 	 	ga-diupjan	 	'make deep'
 	 	dulþs	 	 	 	'feast'	 	 	 	dulþjan	 	'feast, keep a feast'
 	 	mikils	 	 	 	'great'	 	 	 	mikiljan	 	'magnify, praise'
 	 	riqis	 	 	 	'darkness'	 	 	 	riqizjan	 	'become dark'
 	 	sigljō	 	 	 	'seal'	 	 	 	sigljan	 	'seal, shut'
 	 	stáins	 	 	 	'stone'	 	 	 	stáinjan	 	'stone, cast stones at'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In Gothic, as in the other Germanic languages, the reflex of the PGmc *-i/ij- suffix in certain morphological forms depends on the shape of the root to which it was affixed. There are two possibilities: Gothic -ji- or -ei- [ī]. First weak conjugation roots thus fall into two groups, based on the reflex of the suffix. The reflex of the suffix only differs between the groups in the 2nd and 3rd person singular present indicative active, in the 2nd person plural present indicative active, and in the 2nd person plural imperative. Elsewhere the form of the suffix does not depend on root shape, but appears as -j- in all other present forms. The suffix appears as -i- in all past forms. For the sake of clarity, paradigms for the two types of class i weak verbs will be listed separately.

In order to make a clear statement of the distinction between the types of class i weak verbs, we must refine our terminology of syllable length. Recall that, according to the definition given in Section 2.3, syllables ending in a short vowel are termed short, all others are long. Thus long syllables end in a consonant or contain a long vowel, or both. For the purposes of describing the first weak conjugation, a further distinction must be made. We will restrict the term long syllable and define the term overlong syllable as follows.

long syllable: a syllable containing a short vowel followed by a consonant, or containing a long vowel with no following consonant;
overlong syllable: a syllable containing a long vowel followed by a consonant.
Note that traditional terminology in Germanic linguistics often includes the former category under the heading 'short' and terms the latter 'long'. This system has its advantages; the system above is employed here in order to keep terminology as close as possible to that used in grammars of other early Indo-European languages, e.g. Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit.

37.2.1 Class ia Verbs

Given the above definitions of syllable length, we may succinctly characterize the first type of class i weak verbs:

Class ia	 	Description	 	Explanation
 	 	 	 	 
Syllable	 	verbs with long stem syllable	 	For example, the stem syllable may contain a short vowel followed by a consonant, as nasjan 'to save'; or the stem syllable may contain a long vowel with no following consonant, as stōjan 'to judge'.
 	 	 	 	 
Reflex	 	-ji-	 	in the 2/3 sg. and 2 pl. present indicative active, and in the 2 pl. imperative.
[Note that this class, according to traditional terminology, contains roots whose stem syllable is 'short' (nasjan) or 'long' and open (stōjan).]

The verb nasjan 'to save' serves to illustrate the forms of verbs whose stem contains a short vowel followed by a consonant. The forms are as follows.

Class ia verbs are thus characterized by the fact that -j- is retained in all present forms, where it is followed by a vowel. Note that the imperative 2 sg. ending is -ei, so the -j- becomes [ī] when final. When -j- comes between two consonants, as in the past forms, it is voiced as -i-. Before a vowel, ō is written au.

37.2.2 Class ib Verbs

Again according to the above definitions of syllable length, we may succinctly characterize the second type of class i weak verbs:

Class ib	 	Description	 	Explanation
 	 	 	 	 
Syllable	 	verbs with overlong stem syllable, or polysyllabic stems	 	For example, a monosyllabic stem contains a long vowel followed by a consonant, as sōkjan 'to seek'; or the stem may contain more than one syllable, as glitmunjan 'to shine'.
 	 	 	 	 
Reflex	 	-ei-	 	in the 2/3 sg. and 2 pl. present indicative active, and in the 2 pl. imperative.
[Note that this class, according to traditional terminology, contains roots whose stem syllable is 'long' and closed (sōkjan).]

The verb sōkjan 'to seek' serves to illustrate the forms of verbs whose stem contains a long vowel followed by a consonant. The forms are as follows.

Class ib	 	Active	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive	 	 
Overlong

Class ib verbs are thus characterized by the fact that -j- is retained before the back vowel -a-, but assimilates with a following -i- to give ī (written ei). As in class ia the imperative 2 sg. ending is -ei, so the -j- becomes [ī] when final. Likewise, as in class ia, when -j- comes between two consonants, it is voiced as -i-.

37.2.3 Irregular and t-Suffix Weak Verbs

The verb gaggan 'to go' was originally a reduplicated verb of the strong class VII. It nevertheless once shows a weak preterite gaggida in Gothic; generally the suppletive forms iddja, iddjēs, etc. supply the past tense of gaggan. Some weak verbs already lacked in Proto-Germanic the medial -i- between root and dental suffix. The ensuing phonetic environment led to -t- as the reflex of the dental suffix in the past forms. The verb káupatjan 'to buffet' falls into this category, though the past participle shows -i-. The following is a list of the verbs in Gothic showing these peculiar features.

Infinitive	 	Past 1/3 Sg.	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
briggan	 	brāhta	 	brāhts	 	'bring'

38 The Second Weak Conjugation
The second weak conjugation is characterized by the suffix PIE *-ā- > PGmc *-ō- added to the verbal root. These verbs are typically denominative. Consider the following examples:

 	 	Nominative	 	Stem	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Weak ii Infin.	 	Meaning
Denominative

 	 	fráuja	 	fráujin-	 	'lord'	 	 	 	fráujinōn	 	'rule over'
 	 	grēdus	 	grēdu-	 	'hunger'	 	 	 	grēdōn	 	'hunger, be hungry'
 	 	gudja	 	gudjin-	 	'priest'	 	 	 	gudjinōn	 	'be a priest'
 	 	hatis	 	hatiz-	 	'hatred'	 	 	 	hatizōn	 	'be angry'
 	 	kara	 	karō-	 	'care'	 	 	 	karōn	 	'be concerned'
 	 	páida	 	páidō-	 	'shirt'	 	 	 	ga-páidōn	 	'clothe'
 	 	reiki	 	reiki-	 	'realm'	 	 	 	reikinōn	 	'rule'
 	 	sidus	 	sidu-	 	'custom'	 	 	 	sidōn	 	'practice'
 	 	skalks	 	skalka-	 	'servant'	 	 	 	skalkinōn	 	'serve'
 	 	sunja	 	sunjō-	 	'truth'	 	 	 	sunjōn	 	'defend oneself'
 	 	þiudans	 	þiudana-	 	'king'	 	 	 	þiudanōn	 	'be king, rule'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Unlike in the first weak conjugation, the form of the class ii suffix does not depend on root shape, but appears as -ō- in all other present forms. The suffix likewise appears as -ō- in all past forms.

The verb salbōn 'to anoint' serves to illustrate the forms of class ii weak verbs. The forms are as follows.

Note the suffix -ō- appears in all forms built to the present stem, replacing even the distinctive suffix of the subjunctive. The -ō- also precedes the dental suffix in past forms, indicative and subjunctive.

39 The Subjunctive
The subjunctive in Gothic describes an event which is viewed by the speaker as not actual. For example, the speaker may feel that the event is potential ('were I your brother...'), supposed ('assuming this be true...'), reported ('I've heard he would walk at night...'), or desired ('Thy kingdom come...'). The non-factual or unconfirmed status of these events in the view of the speaker is conveyed by the use of the subjunctive. The corresponding statements, when the speaker views the events as factual or confirmed, employ the indicative. The statements are actual ('I am your brother'), known ('It is true that...'), witnessed ('I saw that he walked...'), or realized ('as we forgive those who trespass...').

Gothic, like other Germanic languages, has two subjunctive formations, one built from the present stem of the verb, the other built from the past stem. The distinction, however, is not one of tense -- it cannot be, since the subjunctive denotes an event which is unreal, and therefore cannot be located in time. The distinction between Past and Present Subjunctive, then, is essentially one of the event viewed as a complete whole (Past Subjunctive) or as incomplete (Present Subjunctive), or rather, as viewed without specific reference to its completion (though it may in fact be completed). The formation and use of the subjunctive in Gothic is described in the following sections.

Proto-Indo-European possessed two different verb formations to denote events viewed as unreal: the subjunctive and the optative. Succinctly, the subjunctive denotes events which are simply viewed as unreal, e.g. 'if I were you...'; the optative generally denotes wishes, e.g. 'would I were you...'. Inasmuch as most subjunctive forms in Gothic actually continue the forms of the PIE optative, many grammars use the term optative instead of subjunctive. By the time of the Gothic texts, however, the point is pragmatically moot, since the functions of PIE subjunctive and optative both have merged into the single irrealis mood called subjunctive in these lessons.

39.1 Present Subjunctive
Both strong and weak verbs form the present subjunctive from the same stem as the present indicative of the verb. The verbs baíran 'to bear', nasjan 'to save', and salbōn 'to anoint', serve to illustrate the paradigm. The verb wisan 'to be' forms the subjunctive from the stem found in the present indicative plural, e.g. 1 pl. sijum.

3	 	baíráina	 	nasjáina	 	salbōna	 	sijáina
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The verb wisan 'to be' has no extant dual forms in the present subjunctive. The -ō- of verbs of the second weak conjugation stands in place of the -ái- found in the subjunctive of other verbs.

The present subjunctive is often used to express wishes capable of fulfillment: wiljáu ei mis gibáis ana mesa háubiþ Iōhannis 'I desire that thou give me the head of John on a platter' (Mark 6.25); weihnái namō þein; qimái þiudanassus þeins; waírþái wilja þeins... jah ni briggáis uns in fráistubnjái 'hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done... and lead us not into temptation' (Matthew 6.9-13); guþ gibái izwis 'God grant you' (Romans 15.5). The present subjunctive is also used to refer to the following circumstances:

exhortation: gawaúrkjáima hleiþrōs þrins 'let us make three tents' (Luke 9.33; but compare Mark 9.5 gawaúrkjam); ni filuwaúrdjáiþ 'do not use many words' (Matthew 6.7); þaírhgaggáima ju und Bēþlahaím jah saíƕáima 'let us now go unto Bethlehem and see' (Luke 2.15); swa nu bidjáiþ jus 'so therefore pray ye' (Matthew 6.9).
indirect discourse: The present subjunctive may be introduced by either a present or past tense verb. For example, jus qiþiþ þatei wajamērjáu 'do you say that I blaspheme?' (John 10.36); Farisaieis frēhun ina skuldu sijái mann qēn afsatjan 'the Pharisees asked him if it be lawful for a man to put away (his) wife' (Mark 10.2).
possibility: faírgunja miþsatjáu 'I could remove mountains' (I Corinthians 13.2); jah þan in sis silbin ƕōftulja habái 'and then shall he have rejoicing in himself' (Galatians 6.4).
purpose: The present subjunctive may follow either a primary or secondary tense. For example, swa liuhtjái liuhaþ izwar... ei gasaíƕáina izwara gōda waúrstwa jah háuhjáina attan izwarana 'let your light shine... that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father' (Matthew 5.16); galisiþ þōs aflifnandeins draúhsnōs, þei waítái ni fraqistnái 'gather up the remaining fragments, that nothing may be lost' (John 6.12); Mōsēs gamēlida unsis... ei nimái brōþar is þō qēn is jah ussatjái barna brōþr seinamma 'Moses wrote unto us... that his brother should (and shall) take his wife and raise up children unto his brother' (Mark 12.19).
supposition: jabái ƕas mein waúrd fastái 'if anyone keep my word' (John 8.52); táujiþ jah láisjái 'shall do and (may indeed) teach' (Matthew 5.19).
uncertainty: ƕas þannu sa sijái 'who, then, can this be?' (Matthew 4.41).
The present subjunctive is also used to refer to present or future time after the conjunction faúrþizei 'before': faúrþizei jus bidjáiþ ina 'before ye ask him' (Matthew 6.8).

39.2 Past Subjunctive
The past subjunctive is formed from the same stem found in the past plural indicative of the verb. This holds true for both strong and weak verbs, so that the strong past subjunctive shows the ablaut of the strong plural (and reduplication in verbs of class VII), and the weak past subjunctive shows the dental suffix found in the weak plural. The verbs baíran 'to bear', nasjan 'to save', salbōn 'to anoint', and wisan 'to be' serve to illustrate the paradigm.

Forms for the first person dual are lacking in the weak verbs.

The past subjunctive is often used to express wishes unfulfilled or unable to be fulfilled: iþ wissēdeis... 'hadst thou but known...' (Luke 19.42); jah wáinei þiudanōdēdeiþ 'and would that ye did reign!' (I Corinthians 4.8). The past subjunctive also expresses unreal conditions, present or past: wáinei þiudanōdēdeiþ 'would that ye reigned!' (I Corinthians 4.8); wēseis hēr 'if thou hadst been here' (John 11.21). The past subjunctive is also used to refer to the following circumstances:

exhortation: anabáuþ im ei mann ni qēþeina 'he commanded them that they should not tell any man' (Mark 7.36).
indirect discourse: The past subjunctive is always introduced by a past tense verb. For example, þadei háusidēdun ei is wēsi 'where they heard he was' (Mark 6.55); jah sōkidēdun ƕáiwa ina innatbēreina jah galagidēdeina in andwaírþja is 'and they sought how they might bring him in and lay him before him' (Luke 5.18).
possibility: ƕa wēsi þata 'what that might be' (Luke 15.26).
purpose: The past subjunctive rarely follows a primary tense, generally following a secondary tense. For example, atgibana ist mis hnuþō leika meinamma, aggilus satanins, ei mik káupastēdi 'there is given to me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me' (II Corinthians 12.7); jah allans þans ubil habandans gaháilida, ei usfullnōdēdi 'and healed all those that were sick, that it might be fulfilled' (Matthew 8.16-17); rūna nēmun allái þái gudjans... bi Iēsu, ei afdáuþidēdeina ina 'all the chief priests... took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death' (Matthew 27.1).
supposition: hugidēdun þatei is bi slēp qēþi 'they supposed that he was speaking of sleep' (John 11.13).
uncertainty: ni kunnandans ƕaþar skuldēdi máiza 'not knowing which should be greater' (Skeireins 3.4).
The past subjunctive is also used to refer to past time after the conjunction faúrþizei 'before': faúrþizei Abraham waúrþi, im ik 'before Abraham was, I am' (John 8.58).

40 Tense and Aspect
Tense places an event on a timeline, relative to the perspective of the one uttering a clause. The speaker's perspective is defined as now, and this partitions the timeline into past (before now), present (concurrent with now), and future (after now). Aspect, by contrast, focuses on the speaker's conception of the event represented by a verb. Sometimes the conception of an event is part and parcel of the meaning of the word itself, whereby one refers to lexical aspect (the terms Aktionsart and manner/type of action are also found). In other instances, however, certain changes in morphology may denote different conceptions of the same basic event. Scholars generally refer to this morphological aspect with the unqualified term 'aspect'.

Events may be durative, i.e. extending over time, or punctual, without temporal extent. Likewise events may be active/eventive, denoting an input of energy to maintain action, or stative, denoting a quality or state of being maintained without effort. Any of these may be further characterized as perfective or imperfective. An event is perfective when it is viewed with specific reference to its endpoints; that is, both beginning and end are included in the event, so that the event makes a conceptually indivisible whole. An event is imperfective when it is not perfective. More specifically, an event is imperfective when the speaker does not make reference to the endpoints of the action, so that the conception is not that of an indivisible whole, but rather that of an action with internal structure.

40.1 The ga- Prefix
Proto-Indo-European verbs functioned primarily according to an aspectual system, at its most basic divided into active and stative (or eventive and stative). Tense was a secondary development largely confined to the individual daughter languages. It appears that adverbial elements within the utterance could also convey aspectual value. In some of the daughter languages, these adverbial elements came to occupy a position just before the verb, hence the term preverbs. The preverbal elements came most conspicuously in Slavic to develop a robust aspectual system complementary to the suffixal system inherited from PIE. But the aspectual nature of preverbs has left possible traces in other branches of Indo-European, including Germanic. The most likely member of this preverbal system is PIE *kom- 'near, at, with', which in pretonic position voices the intial *k- > g- [ḡ] according to Verner's Law (see Section 6), and remains as ga- in Gothic and Old Saxon, ge- in other Germanic languages.

In the earliest stages of PIE, preverbs were uncommon, but sentence particles could nevertheless perform an aspectual role. PIE *kom- has left traces of its independence from verbs even in those daughter languages in which it seems to serve as an aspectual preverb. Its use as a postpositive particle survives in Latin mē-cum 'with me' and tē-cum 'with you'; likewise it is found at the end of sentence-initial enclitic chains in Hittite nu-kan and Vedic nú-kam, where it fills a perfectivizing role. This freedom even survives in Gothic, where other sentence elements may intervene between ga- and the verb. For example, þu ga-u-láubjeis du sunáu gudis 'do ye believe in the Son of Man (God)' (John 9.35); ga-þáu-láubidēdeiþ mis 'ye would believe me' (John 5.46). This extends to strings of elements, such as ga-þ-þan-miþ-sandidēdun < ga-(u)h-þan-miþ-sandidēdun 'we are sending along with (him)' (II Corinthians 8.18); even to nominal elements, such as ga-u-ƕa-sēƕi 'did you see anything?' (Mark 8.23).

There is some cross-linguistic evidence supporting the possibility that PIE *kom- served as a perfectivizing preverb in various daughter languages. For example, one finds the common contrast of PGmc *þahan (cf. Old Norse þega) and Latin tacēre, both 'be silent', versus Gothic ga-þahan and Latin con-ticēre, both 'fall silent'. This contrast of perfectivity remains in some places within the Gothic corpus. For example, take háusjan and gaháusjan, both 'to hear'. In the statement saei habái áusōna háusjandōna gaháusjái 'Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear' (Mark 4.9), the unprefixed participial form háusjandōna is temporally unbounded, akin to 'ears hearing, and keeping right on hearing'. The prefixed form gaháusjái, by contrast, is bounded, and akin to 'let him hear, once and for all, and get it done with'. Consider also the following examples contrasting the verbal pair sigqan-gasigqan, both meaning 'sink':

Perfective: andanahtja þan waúrþanamma, þan gasagq sauil, bērun du imma allans 'With evening having come, when the sun had set, they brought them all to him' (Mark 1.32);
Imperfective: miþþanei þan sagq sunnō, allái... brahtēdun ins du imma 'While the sun was sinking, they all... brought them to him' (Luke 4.40).
Within Germanic, the ga- prefix was early associated with the past participle. In some of the Germanic languages, such as Old Saxon, this prefix was so common as to become essentially obligatory on the past participle. Compare

Language	 	Infinitive	 	3 Sg. Past	 	1 Pl. Past	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Gothic	 	bindan	 	band	 	bundum	 	bundans	 	'bind'
Old English	 	bindan	 	band	 	bundon	 	bunden	 	'bind'
Old Saxon	 	bindan	 	band	 	bundun	 	gibundan	 	'bind'
Old High German	 	bintan	 	bant	 	buntun	 	gibuntan	 	'bind'
Some verbs, however, typically occurred with the ga- prefix thoughout the paradigm. Compare

Language	 	Infinitive	 	3 Sg. Past	 	1 Pl. Past	 	Past Part.	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Old English	 	ge-wītan	 	ge-wāt	 	ge-witon	 	ge-witen	 	'go'
Old Saxon	 	gi-uuītan	 	gi-uuēt	 	gi-uuitun	 	gi-uuitan	 	'go'
This prefix is found with cognate verbs even outside Germanic: compare Gothic ga-qiman and Old English ge-cuman, both 'come', to Latin con-venīre 'come'. As the aspect system of late PIE and early PGmc gave way to a true tense system, the stative developed into a past tense in Germanic, parallel to the development, e.g., of the PIE stative into the perfect of Greek and Sanskrit. At this stage the ga- prefix came to be naturally associated with the past tense.

40.2 Future
Gothic has no specific morphological forms to denote the future tense. Instead, Gothic employs the present forms with future sense, a trait it shares with the other Germanic languages -- compare Modern English 'I am going to the store in five minutes; is anybody coming?' Both present indicative and present subjunctive forms are used in this manner. Consider the following examples: áudagái þái hráinjahaírtans, untē þái guþ gasaíƕand 'blessed (are) the pure in heart, for they shall see God' (Matthew 5.8); ni ufarswaráis, iþ usgibáis fráujin áiþans þeinans 'thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths' (Matthew 5.33); ni maúrþrjáis; iþ saei maúrþreiþ skula waírþiþ stauái 'thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment' (Matthew 5.21).

Also like the other Germanic languages, Gothic employs a few auxiliary verbs to form a periphrastic future: skulan 'shall', haban 'have', duginnan 'begin'. Compare Modern English 'I shall return' and 'I have to go in five minutes'. Such constructions are rare. Consider the following examples: ƕa skuli þata barn waírþan 'what manner of child shall this be?' (Luke 1.66); þaruh sa andbahts meins wisan habáiþ 'and there shall also my servant be' (John 12.26); iþ þatei táuja, jah táujan haba 'but what I do, and will do' (II Corinthians 11.12); untē gáunōn jah grētan duginnid 'for ye shall mourn and weep' (Luke 6.25); jah in þamma faginō, akei jah faginōn duginna 'and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice' (Philippians 1.18).

Gothic also occasionally uses the adjective anawaírþs 'future' to express the future: þatei anawaírþ was uns du winnan agliþōs 'that we should suffer tribulation', literally 'that it was future for us to suffer...' (I Thessalonians 3.4); izei anawaírþái wēsun du galáubjan imma '(to them) which should hereafter believe on him' (I Timothy 1.16).

An event completed in the future, i.e. the future perfect, is likewise rendered in Gothic by present forms. For example, ni usgaggis jáinþrō, untē usgibis þana minnistan kintu 'thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing', meaning 'till thou shalt have paid...' (Matthew 5.26); hana ni hrukeiþ, untē þu mik afáikis kunnan þrim sinþam 'the cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice', meaning 'till thou shalt have denied...' (John 13.38).

40.3 Historical Present
Gothic makes use of the historical present, though only when the Greek does so as well. The term historical present denotes the use of a present tense form to refer to a past action. This is found in Modern English, more commonly in some speakers than others, and forms a marked narrative technique for jokes of the form 'Two guys walk into a bar...'. The general explanation for such present tense use is that use of the present tense where the listener expects a past tense adds a sense of vividness, bringing the listener into the narrative instead of keeping him or her at a mental distance. This is a common technique in historical narratives in the classical languages Latin and Greek, and is found in Germanic languages as well -- prominently so in Old Norse. Gothic however provides only instances which mimic their Greek prototype. For example, naúhþan imma rōdjandin gaggiþ sums mannē 'while he was still speaking, a certain one of men comes...' (Luke 8.49); þō qaþ, jah afar þata qiþiþ du im 'these things said he, and after that he saith unto them' (John 11.11). Occasionally the Gothic translates a Greek historical present with a past form: jah atiddjēdun du Iēsua, jah gasaíƕand þana wōdan 'and they came to Jesus, and see the possessed (one)' (Mark 5.15). Here the past form atiddjēdun translates the Greek present form ērkhontai 'come', while the present form gasaíƕand mimics the Greek present theōrousin.

Lesson 9
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Gothic Wanderings, 376-401
In the year 376, the Goths sent a request to cross the Danube into Roman territory. The clearest source for events of the Gothic crossing into Roman territory is Ammianus Marcellinus. According to his account, in 376 the Tervingi under Fritigern and Alaviv were allowed to cross the Danube into Roman territory and settle in Thrace. They may have been ordered to disarm as a condition of entry, but if so, the Roman officials in charge seemed to ignore this. They were not allowed to settle as a separate group with their own territory, and they had no autonomous status within the empire. The mass move strained Roman resources in terms of manpower and equipment to ferry the Goths across the Danube; it likewise caused shortages of food.

Lupinicus, a Roman commander in Thrace, was dispatched with some troops to provide an escort to the Goths, weakening Roman forces along the Danube. As a result, other tribes subsequently forced their way across the Danube: Greuthungi under Alatheus and Safrax; Greuthungi under Farnobius; Taifali from the region of Walachia. The Taifali and Greuthungi under Farnobius coalesced into one group; those under Alatheus and Safrax joined with Fritigern. Lupicinus invited the mutually antagonistic Fritigern and Alaviv to a feast, but a quarrel ensued in which Roman soldiers killed the Gothic escorts of Fritigern and Alaviv. Fritigern escaped, but Alaviv's name is no longer mentioned by Ammianus; likewise the name Tervingi is no longer mentioned, only Goths.

The Goths began to ravage the land. Lupicinus went to put down the revolt, but he was killed and his forces were wiped out. Other Goths in Roman employ joined in the revolt, leading to an unsuccessful Gothic siege of Adrianople, led by Fritigern. Emperor Valens in the Eastern Empire sent troops led by Traianus and Profuturus to meet the Goths in Thrace; coemperor Gratian of the Western Empire sent troops under Frigeridus and together they tried to starve the Tervingi under Fritigern. Meanwhile Frigeridus suffered an attack of gout and command fell to Richomeres. Both Gothic and imperial forces could finally wait no longer and attacked one another, but the outcome was inconclusive.

Fritigern subsequently convinced Alatheus and Safrax to join him, adding Greuthungi, Alanic, and Hunnic cavalry to his troops. Frigeridus returned to Thrace in 377 and killed Farnobius in a battle against Greuthungi and Taifali troops. Fritigern called a general retreat; later in 378 he sent a priest to Valens demanding all of Thrace, but simultaneously sent a secret letter offering himself as a Roman ally. Valens, sensing Fritigern's weakness, attacked the Goths, leading his troops along with the commander Sebastianus, who had replaced Traianus. The Roman troops left from Adrianople. Fritigern's cavalry quickly routed the Roman cavalry, and shortly afterward the infantry, with the result that the battle ended in a Gothic victory. Valens was seriously wounded in the fight and subsequently died.

Bolstered by their victory, the Goths continued to pillage the surrounding areas. But ironically the newfound success led to a concomitant sense of self-satisfaction among the Goths, with the result that Fritigern lost some of his troop's cohesion. To drive off the Gothic plunderers, the emperor Theodosius enlisted the help of the Goth Modares-Modaharius and later Athanaric to fight Fritigern's forces. With their aid they overcame the latter and struck a treaty with Fritigern's former subjects in 382.

As part of the treaty, the Goths were settled in Dacia and Thrace. They received land for their own use and were considered autonomous, but did not own property according to imperial law. They were obliged to enter Roman military service, but could only receive subordinate commands. They were exempt from taxation.

Soon the empire was again in turmoil. Out of the destabilization caused by the would-be usurper Maximus, a Goth from Moesia by the name of Alaric headed an uprising in 391. His forces were eventually defeated, but Alaric was released on the orders of Theodosius, a scenario which was to happen four more times between 392 and 402. Eventually Alaric returned to serve Theodosius in putting down another attempted usurpation by Eugenius in 394. After Theodosius died in 395, the Gothic troops were discharged, but lack of supplies led to plundering on their trip home.

In 394-395 the Huns finally pushed across the Danube and drove the major part of the Gothic forces to seek a safe haven. This majority, under Alaric, pushed to Constantinople and reached an agreement with the top imperial advior Rufinus in which Alaric was allowed a high military post and his Gothic followers granted entrance into eastern Illyricum. They eventually forced their way south as far as Larissa, then fought and plundered until they reached the Peloponnesus. The Romans were eventually pressured into a treaty in 397, granting the Goths land in central Macedonia between the Haliacmon and Axius rivers, and granting Alaric a high military post with Illyrian troops under his command, integrating him into the Roman military hierarchy once again.

In this position Alaric consolidated his power: he became the ward of Gothic ethnic identity, and had the authority to punish acts of desertion by opportunistic Gothic chiefs. It is not clear if Alaric was elevated to a true king, a þiudans, but his status as reiks reached a new height, with monarchic overtones.

In 399 the Goth Tribigild led an uprising in Phrygia, his forces consisting in large part of Greuthungi who had formerly been loyal to Odotheus. They ravaged Asia Minor until they met with defeat in Pisidia. Tribigild escaped with 300 men. Gainas was eventually sent with Roman forces to stamp out the rebellion, but sometime around 400 he changed sides and helped the Goths cross the Bosporus. Tribigild was killed shortly thereafter, but Gainas soon occupied Constantinople itself. The imperial palace was burned, and the populace rallied against the numerically inferior Goths. Seven hundred sought refuge in an Orthodox church, but were killed by order of the emperor Arcadius.

Gainas escaped and tried to cross back into Asia Minor, but a fellow tribesman, Fravitta, led a Roman fleet to destroy their makeshift rafts. Gainas evidently turned north seeking to lead his remaining Goths back to their homeland across the Danube. They met with the Huns and suffered defeat; the Hunnic commander Uldin sent the head of Gainas to Constantinople. The emperor received it on January 3, 401.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is Mark 16.1-12. The first section, Mark 16:1-8, recounts how two of the women in Jesus' entourage were preparing to enter the borrowed tomb in which the Savior was buried, remove the death shroud, and anoint his body with the customary burial spices; but they found the tomb empty. Verses 9-20, of which 9-12a are included here, seem to constitute an addition to Mark's gospel; this ending, written in another style, was supplied by a much later writer, as it exists in none of the best Greek manuscripts. It is nevertheless already present in the 4th century manuscript used to produce the Gothic Bible.

In the first verse we find an example of a genitive absolute: inwisandins sabbate dagis 'when the day of the sabbath was past' (Mark 16.1). These genitive constructions are relatively rare in Gothic, this being an imitation of the Greek diagenoménou tou sabbátou. Unfortunately such slavish adherence to the morphologically more robust Greek original creates awkard sense in the Gothic, since the Greek aorist participle denotes a completed action, while the Gothic present participle ostensibly has the sense of an on-going action.

In Mark 16.5 we find the term taíhswái 'right (side)'. This derives from the adjective *taíhswa 'right'. The phrase taíhswō handus 'right hand (side)' has been shortened simply to the weak feminine adjective alone: taíhswō, as encountered in Matthew 6.3 in Lesson 5; or less frequently to a strong feminine adjective as here. The same process has left the Greek cognate adjective hē deksía 'the right (hand)' with the same denotation. Latin similarly uses the feminine adjective to denote the right side: dextra (manus) 'right (hand)', so ad dextram 'to the right', and hence Modern Spanish derecha 'to the right' -- but derecho 'straight'. The suffix -w- is the same as that found in Greek, i.e. *deksiwos > deksios (compare Mycenaean de-ki-si-wo). The suffix is absent in the Latin cognate, though present in laevus 'left'.

Mark 16.6 provides an interesting grammatical gem: sai þana staþ 'behold the place'. The particle sai generally functions as a weak exclamatory, equivalent to 'lo!'. Such a function commends one scholarly theory as to the origin of the interjection, namely that it derives from a compound of the Gothic demonstrative sa with the PIE deictic particle i, as found in, e.g., Greek houtos-í 'this one here' or vuv-í 'just now'. Another theory suggests that the form is in fact the locative of the sa- pronoun. The above phrase, however, contains sai followed by an accusative, which is difficult to construe according to the above theories. A third possibility exists, namely that sai is an apocopated form of the 2nd person singular imperative of saíƕan, thus saíƕ 'look (at)!', with loss of the final consonant -ƕ. Although not without its problems, this interpretation makes good sense of the accusative -- now the direct object of a verb -- in this phrase.

Another interesting construction is found in Mark 16.8: dizuh-þan-sat ijos reiro jah usfilmei, literally 'and then a trembling beset them, and amazement'. Note here the interpolation of -uh and þan between the prefix and root of the verb dis-sitan 'settle upon'. In intervocalic position, the -s of the prefix voices to -z-. Such insertion of conjunctions between verb and preverb is not uncommon in Gothic, and may even include nominal elements such as ƕa 'anything'. See also the discussion of the ga-prefix in Lesson 8, Section 40.1.

Translation
From the King James version:
16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. 2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 8 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.
9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. 10 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.

Grammar
41 The Third Weak Conjugation
The third weak conjugation is characterized by the suffix PIE *-oi- > PGmc *-ai- added to the verbal root. The verbs of this class are typically not derived from other sources, and are generally durative or stative (see Section 40). For example, Gothic þuláiþ 'puts up with, endures' (compare also Old High German dolēt), Gothic siláiþ 'is silent', Gothic þaháiþ 'is silent' (compare Old High German dagēt).

The verb haban 'to have' serves to illustrate the forms of class iii weak verbs. The forms are as follows.

Class iii	 	Active	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive

2	 	habats	 	habáits	 	habats

2	 	habáidēduts	 	habáidēdeits

Pres. Ptc.	 	habands	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	habáiþs	 	 
The origin of the present forms is unclear. Some scholars propose PIE *kapēti or *kapējéti, though this is less likely than proposing a PIE middle ending *kap-oi. This was then extended by the third singular ending *-ti: *kap-oi > *kap-oi-ti > Gothic habáiþ. Such a middle construction is also consonant with the stativity of many of the verbs of this class.

42 The Fourth Weak Conjugation
The fourth weak conjugation is characterized by the suffix PIE *-nā- > PGmc *-nō- added to the verbal root. The verbs of this class are typically denominative or deverbative. Consider the following examples:

 	 	Nominative	 	Stem	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Weak iv Infin.	 	Meaning
Denominative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	fulls	 	fulla-	 	'full'	 	 	 	fullnan	 	'become full'
 	 	háuhs	 	háuha-	 	'high'	 	 	 	us-háuhnan	 	'be glorified'
 	 	weihs	 	weiha-	 	'holy'	 	 	 	weihnan	 	'be hallowed'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Strong Infin.	 	Past Part.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Deverbative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	andbindan	 	andbundans	 	'unbind'	 	 	 	andbundnan	 	'become unbound'
 	 	fraliusan	 	fralusans	 	'lose'	 	 	 	fralusnan	 	'be lost'
 	 	wakan	 	*wakans	 	'be awake'	 	 	 	gawaknan	 	'keep awake'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The verb fullnan 'to become full' serves to illustrate the forms of class iv weak verbs. The forms are as follows.

Class iv	 	Active	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive

3	 	fullnōda	 	fullnōdēdi	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Du.	 	fullnōdēdu	 	fullnōdēdeiwa	 	 	 	 	 	 
2	 	fullnōdēduts	 	fullnōdēdeits	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	fullnōdēdum	 	fullnōdēdeima

3	 	fullnōdēdun	 	fullnōdēdeina	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infinitive	 	fullnan	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	fullnands	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-	 	 
In the past tense, the forms of class iv weak verbs are thus the same as those of class ii, except for the insertion of the -n- suffix. Mediopassive forms are lacking in Gothic for this class of verbs (not unexpectedly, given the intransitive nature of the verbs and their possible origin in the PIE middle voice). There are also no extant forms of past participles.

43 Preterite-Present Verbs
Preterite-present verbs derive their name from the fact that they are in origin preterites of strong verbs, whose present forms fell out of the paradigm, and whose forms were reanalyzed with present sense. The present tense forms are built on what was the second principal part in the singular, and on what was the third principal part in the plural. Frequently infinitive forms and past participles are lacking. These verbs often acquired new finite past tense forms through the mechanism of the dental suffix found in the weak verbs.

Because of their origin in the strong verbs, there are six original classes or gradations of preterite-present verbs.

The First Class or First Gradation of preterite-present verbs is typified by the verb wáit 'I know'. Its evolution was as follows:

Class I	 	1 Sg. Pres.	 	1 Pl. Pres.	 	1 Sg. Past	 	1 Pl. Past	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PIE	 	*wóida	 	*widmé	 	*wíssōm	 	*wissmé	 	'know'
PGmc.	 	*wait	 	*witum	 	*wissō (EG -a)	 	*wissum	 	'know'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The forms of first gradation verbs in Gothic are as follows:

Infinitive	 	witan	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Part.	 	witands	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
The Second Class or Second Gradation of preterite-present verbs is typified by the verb dáug 'it is good for, profits'. Its evolution was as follows:

Class II	 	1 Sg. Pres.	 	1 Pl. Pres.	 	1 Sg. Past	 	1 Pl. Past	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PIE	 	*dhóugha	 	*dhughmé	 	*dhúktōm	 	*dhuktmé	 	'be valid'
PGmc.	 	*dauḡ	 	*duḡum	 	*doxtō (EG *dohta)	 	*duxtum (EG *dohtum)	 	'be valid'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Only one form from the second gradation survives in the Gothic documents:

2nd Gradation	 	 
 	 	dáug
 	 	'profits'
Present Indic.	 	 
3 Sg.	 	dáug

The present participle of ōgs also survives in the compound adjective un-agands 'fearless'. The verb -áihan 'to have' may have originally been a verb of class VII. Its infinitive appears only in the compound form faír-áihan 'to partake of'.

44 Anomalous Verbs
The so-called anomalous verbs are actually the remnants of athematic verbs. The only two such verbs are im 'I am' and wiljáu 'I will'. The verb im 'I am' is athematic in the present indicative and subjunctive, but forms a suppletive system with the verb wisan 'to be', whose forms supply the infintive and the remaining elements of the paradigm. The paradigm is therefore as follows:

wisan 'be'	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	im	 	sijáu	 	 
2	 	is	 	sijáis	 	sái, sijáis
3	 	ist	 	sijái	 	sijái

2	 	*sijuts	 	*sijáits	 	*sijáits

2	 	sijuþ	 	sijáiþ	 	sijáiþ
3	 	sind	 	sijáina	 	sijáina

2	 	wast	 	wēseis	 	 
3	 	was	 	wēsi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Du.	 	wēsu	 	wēseiwa	 	 
2	 	wēsuts	 	wēseits	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	wēsum	 	wēseima	 	 
2	 	wēsuþ	 	wēseiþ	 	 
3	 	wēsun	 	wēseina	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infinitive	 	wisan	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	wisands	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	 	 	 	 	 
The optative forms are used for the imperative, apart from the possible form sái. There are also forms sium and siuþ alternating with sijum and sijuþ, respectively. The initial vowel of ist combines with a preceding vowel in a few common phrases: ni ist > nist; þata ist > þatist; kara ist > karist.

The verb wiljáu 'I will' does not retain any present indicative forms in Gothic. Only preterite subjunctive forms remain (though in Old English only the present subjunctive), which are used in place of the present indicative. From these were built a new infinitive and weak past tense. The forms are therefore as follows:

wiljan 'will'	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
Present	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	wiljáu	 	 
2	 	wileis

1 Du.	 	 	 	 
2	 	wileits

45 Word Derivation
Words in Gothic are generally simple, derivative, or compound. Simple words have no discernable internal parts with meaning of their own. Take for example the nouns atta 'father', áihs 'oath', dags 'day', fótus 'foot', stáins 'stone', waúrd 'word'. Nouns may be derived from other words, such as adjectives and verbs, by means of various suffixes and prefixes. For example suffixation converts the adjective laggs 'long' into the noun laggei 'length', manags 'much' into managei 'multitude', milds 'mild' into mildiþa 'mildness'. Examples of nouns derived from verbs are the following: dragk 'a drink' from drigkan 'to drink', saggws 'song' from siggwan 'to sing', giba 'gift' from giban 'to give', un-witi 'ignorance' from *witan 'to know'. Compound nouns are formed by the conjoining of two or more words to form a noun. In Gothic, the second element is always a noun, though the first element can be a noun, adjective, or particle. When the first element is an a-stem noun or adjective, the -a- of the stem usually remains: áiƕa-tundi 'thornbush', dwala-waúrdei 'foolish talk', weina-triu 'vine'. The -a- remains in short ja-stems, but not in long ja-stems: midja-sweipáins 'the flood', niuja-satiþs 'novice'; but arbi-numja 'heir', agláiti-waúrdei 'indecent language'. The ō-, jō-, i-, and u-stems generally retain their stem vowels when they form the first element of compounds: mōta-staþs 'toll-place', þūsundi-faþs 'leader of a thousand men', mari-sáiws 'sea', fōtu-baúrd 'footboard'. The n-stem nouns employ -a- in compounds: áuga-daúrō 'window', staua-stōls 'judgement seat'. When consonant stems form the first member of a compound, they sometimes employ the vowel -a- by analogy with the a-stems, e.g. brōþra-lubō 'brotherly love' and nahta-mats 'supper'.

Examples of simple adjectives are baírhts 'bright', fagrs 'fair', háils 'whole', siuks 'sick'. Adjectives, like nouns, could be derived by means of prefixes: ana-siuns 'visible', fram-aldrs 'very old', un-fagrs 'unfit'. They could likewise be derived through suffixes: the noun stáins 'stone' yields the adjective stáinahs 'stony', waúrd 'word' yields waúrdahs 'verbal'. Nominal composition might even result in an adjective, the so-called bahuvrīhi or exocentric compound, which describes a person or thing related to the elements of the compound. Modern English is replete with examples: a blackbelt is not a belt, but a martial artist possessing a belt which is black; Blackbeard is not a beard, but a pirate whose beard is black; well-intentioned descibes a person with good intentions. Examples in Gothic are manag-falþs 'having many parts, manifold', láus-handus 'empty-handed'.

Examples of some simple verbs are the following: gaggan 'go', lētan 'let', lisan 'gather', niman 'take', waírþan 'become'. Verbs were often derived from nouns and adjectives by means of prefixes and suffixes. For example, the noun áigin 'property' gives ga-áigin-ōn 'take possession of'; skalks 'servant' gives skalkinōn 'serve'. Many members of the weak verb classes are examples of just such a process, though at times it is difficult to discern which is primary, the nominal item or the verbal. For example, fisks 'a fish' vs. fiskōn 'to fish'; namō 'a name' vs. namnjan 'to name'; weihs 'holy' vs. weihnan 'become holy'.

45.5 Verbal Suffixes
The most common suffixes employed in deriving verbs have actually been dealt with separately. These are in fact the suffixes of most of the weak verb classes. In many instances, however, such derivation had taken place long before Gothic became a separate language in the Germanic family. There are, however, a few additional suffixes used to derive verbs; but they are not sufficiently numerous to form separate verb classes as such. The following chart lists these suffixes, together with their antecedents in the proto-languages, as well as some examples of their use within Gothic.

Lesson 10
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Gothic Wanderings, 401-418
The death of Gainas in 401 stirred Alaric to break the recent treaty and to move from the land granted to the Goths in Macedonia and strike at Italy itself. Alaric eventually attacked Milan, but Roman forces under the command of Stilicho arrived in March 402 and forced him to abandon the attack. Alaric's forces retreated along the northern bank of the river Po, then crossed the river and turned south. They attacked the city Hasta-Asti, but failed to take it; they then retreated upstream to Pollentia-Pollenzo.

Stilicho's forces pursued; among them were Alanic troops under the command of Saul. On Easter Sunday of 402, Stilicho handed over command to the pagan Saul, who proceeded to lead an unexpected attack against Alaric's forces. Alaric was caught off guard, and his infantry suffered heavy losses. He nevertheless managed to save his cavalry, and with them he counterattacked, pushing back the Alans and killing Saul. The Goths then withdrew into the mountains. Evidently a treaty was struck between Stilicho and Alaric.

The Gothic forces left Italy south of the river Po and headed to Verona where they stopped. Sometime later, Stilicho and the Alans attacked again, and the Goths again withdrew into the mountains. Their points of escape were blocked; they were seized by hunger and disease, and large groups of Alaric's forces began to desert. Two Gothic leaders, Ulfilas and Sarus, joined the Romans. The remaining Goths departed Italian territory and continued to ravage the countryside of Illyricum.

Alaric's forces remained relatively confined in Illyricum until the Alans, Vandals, and Suevi together crossed the Rhine into Gaul. Starting in 408, the Eastern and Western empires began a period of reconciliation, which obviated the tactical usefulness of Alaric's treaty with Constantinople. He therefore led his troops to Emona-Laibach in the Julian Alps, and then occupied surrounding areas. Shortly thereafter, Alaric threatened to invade Italy if he did not receive four thousand pounds of gold -- roughly the annual income of a Roman senator, but also an amount on which about 90,000 people could live decently, yielding a possible estimate of the size of Alaric's forces.

Stilicho persuaded Rome to pay the sum, and Alaric was taken into Roman service. He commanded combined Roman and Gothic troops which he led into Gaul against the usurper Constantine. The previously agreed sum of money probably never reached Alaric, since Stilicho was quickly overthrown. In the ensuing instability, a large number of barbarians joined Alaric's forces. Sarus remained with the Romans to take Stilicho's place, having his Hunnic bodyguard killed to secure his position.

Alaric tried to negotiate new terms with the emperor Honorius, but was rejected and therefore quickly moved into Italy. By October of 408 they surrounded Rome and cut off all her supplies. In their desperation, the Romans handed over to Alaric five thousand pounds of gold, thirty thousand pounds of silver, four thousand silk robes, three thousand purple-dyed furs, and three thousand pounds of pepper. In addition Alaric demanded that an embassy be sent to obtain a peace treaty from Honorius, but this never amounted to anything. At the end of 408 Alaric set up camp in Tuscany.

As a result of the economic straits imposed by the Goths' plundering of Rome, their spoils were devalued. This, combined with their subsequent pillaging of those areas which supplied their food, forced Alaric to seek a permanent home for his people. He began negotiations in early 409 with Honorius, but the emperor would not listen, and subsequently marched out with his own forces, accompanied by an auxiliary of Dalmatian troops, to attack Alaric. At this point Alaric was joined by his brother-in-law Athaulf, who led a contingent of combined Gothic and Hunnic cavalry. Alaric managed to defeat the emperor's Dalmatian troops, and again struck up negotiations, demanding Noricum and Venetia.

When that and a second series of negotiations broke down, Alaric again marched on Rome in late 409. The city again capitulated, and Alaric convinced the senate to declare Attalus emperor. Attalus appointed Alaric chief commander of the military, and Athaulf commander of the cavalry, but appointed an anti-Gothic partisan as the senatorial representative. Attalus was baptized by the Arian bishop Sigesar.

At this point it was in Roman, and Gothic, tactical interests to conquer Africa, which was the primary source of Roman grain. Attalus determined to take the region, but failed to accept Gothic assistance, and so the attack failed. Eventually Alaric had Attalus stripped of his office.

Alaric once again renewed negotiations with Honorius, meeting him in person in a small town in the Alps. At the same time, however, Sarus attacked Alaric's forces, and the result was that Honorius again broke off the talks. Alaric and his forces decided to move against Rome once more. They captured the city and continued to plunder it for the next three days. Athaulf captured the emperor's sister, Galla Placidia.

The Goths left as swiftly as they came, and proceeded to march south through Italy. They eventually tried to get to Sicily, but had to abort the attempt by reason of the weather and lack of ships. They eventually retraced their steps and headed north for Campania. There they set up a camp, but Alaric finally died in Bruttium before the year 410 drew to a close.

Athaulf became Gothic king after Alaric. In 411, through the mediation of Attalus, Athaulf struck an accord with Iovinus, the Gallic leader of a Burgundian-Alanic coalition who had recently taken over imperial authority. Sarus too joined the forces of Iovinus. Iovinus tried to consolidate his power on the Italian peninsula, but Athaulf unexpectedly led his forces out of Italy and destroyed Sarus's forces in the process. When Iovinus failed to make Athaulf coemperor, the latter broke his ties with Iovinus and began negotiations with representatives of Honorius, who promised to settle the Goths in Gaul. They reached an agreement sometime in 413.

Iovinus was subsequently captured by the Goths in Valence. In keeping with history, however, Honorius again broke his agreement with the Goths on the pretext that Galla Placidia would first have to be released. Angered once again, the Goths proceeded to ravage Gaul. They capured Narbonne and Toulouse, but failed in an attempt to take Marseille, where Athaulf was wounded.

In January 414, Athaulf married Galla Placidia in Narbonne. The wedding was conducted in Roman fashion. Athaulf seemed ready to cease his wars against Rome and make peace. He relocated to Barcelona, where before long his wife gave birth to a son, baptized with the name Theodosius. Unfortunately the child died shortly thereafter, in 415. Athaulf himself was assassinated in August or September of the same year. He was killed by one of the men in his entourage, by the name of Dubius or Eberwolf, while he and his company were inspecting their horses.

Sarus's brother Sigeric became king, but this lasted only a week. During this short period, he had Athaulf's children by his first wife killed, and humiliated Galla Placidia. In September 415 the Goths chose Valia as their king and resolved to contiue the war against Rome. Again in search of food stores, they marched into the Iberian peninsula intent on crossing into Africa. When they realized they could not cross the Straits of Gibraltar, they abandoned the plan and ultimately, in the spring of 416, Valia surrendered to Constantius, the military commander of the Western imperial forces. Constantius provided supplies for roughly fifteen thousand troops and their retinue, while the Goths turned over Galla Placidia. The Goths then set themselves to expelling imperial enemies from the Spanish peninsula, first turning against the Vandals, then against the Alans, who subsequently formed their own alliance. In 418 Constantius ordered the Goths to desist and called them to Gaul. The Goths were ordered to the valley of the Goronne between Toulouse and Bordeaux.

Valia died in 418 and was succeeded by Theodoric. This marked the beginning of a new period of Gothic power. So ended a biblical 40 years of wandering without a homeland, the result of events set in motion by the advent of the Huns. The Goths were finally in a position to construct an empire of their own: Theodoric's dynasty would go unbroken until 507, and the Goths were secured as a force with which neighboring empires would need to negotiate, recognizing the leadership of the Gothic king and sending hostages to his court. So rose the Visigothic tribe to power.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is 1 Corinthians 13:1-12. Much of the first verse has not survived. In I Corinthians 13.2 we find praúfētjans 'prophecy' The nominative form of this word is generally the neuter plural praúfētja (see verse 13.8). Although deriving ultimately from the Greek prophēteía, the fact that the accented vowel in Greek is merely a glide in Gothic shows that the word is most likely borrowed from the Latin prophētia.

In I Corinthians 13.4 we find the phrase friaþwa usbeisneiga ist, sels ist 'charity is patient, is kind'. Note here the change in gender between usbeisneiga (fem. nom. sg.) and sēls (masc. nom. sg.). In Gothic, nouns grammatically feminine are occasionally treated as masculines, or as neuters when denoting things.

Verse 13.7 contains an interesting display of repetition: allata þuláiþ, allata galáubeiþ, all wēneiþ, alla gabeidiþ 'bears everything, believes everything, hopes everything, endures all things'. Note the alternation between adjectival (zero) and pronominal (-ata) endings in the neuter plural. The Greek uses the same form, pánta, in each phrase.

In 1 Corinthians 13.12 we find a somewhat idiomatic phrase: in frisahtái, literally 'in an image'. Evidently by extension this meant 'in an ephemeral view, in a mere reflection', leading to the sense 'darkly, unclearly, imperfectly'.

Translation
From the King James version:
13:1 (Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass,) or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know ...
Grammar
46 Introduction to Crimean Gothic
Crimean Gothic (CG) is the name given to the language thought to be the dying throes of the East Germanic branch of languages. All that remains of this language is some hundred words copied in a letter of the diplomat Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq. The words so transmitted are similar enough to those of the Biblical Gothic (BG) of Wulfila's translation that scholars are in general agreement that the language in question is indeed Gothic, but there are some differences which suggest it may not be the later surviving form of BG itself. It may have formed a separate member of the East Germanic family, perhaps representing the language of another of the many Gothic tribal factions, but one whose literary records have not survived to the present day.

Busbecq himself was a highly educated man of Flanders, born in 1522 in the town of Comines (Komen). His father was a nobleman and secured for him an excellent education. He began at the University of Louvain in Brabant when he became thirteen, and then continued his education in Paris, Venice, Bologna, and Padua.

Busbecq eventually accepted an appointment in 1554 as an ambassador of Ferdinand I of Austria, who was later to become Holy Roman Emperor (1558-1564). In this appointment, Busbecq was charged with negotiating a peace treaty with the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I, 'the Magnificent'. In early 1555 Busbecq travelled to the Ottoman empire, and returned to Vienna that summer to deliver a letter from Suleiman I to Charles V, then Holy Roman Emperor. He subsequently returned to Constantinople in 1556 and remained in the region for the next seven years as Ferdinand I succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman empire. He eventually negotiated a treaty with the Ottoman empire and returned to Vienna in 1562, then continuing to Frankfurt to present the treaty to Ferdinand.

Busbecq was subsequently knighted and continued to serve the imperial family in various political roles. In late 1592, then working in France, Busbecq took some time away from his service to visit his homeland. As he travelled through Normandy, he was seized by a group of soldiers, but set free the next day. Unfortunately, he quickly took ill and died on the 28th of October, 1592.

Busbecq had the reputation of being a man of many languages. Some biographers claim he had a native command of Flemish, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, German, and 'Slavic'. What is meant by the last is not exactly clear. Flemish was of course his native tongue, and his education evidently provided for a firm grasp of Latin, as the letter shows. He spent time at universities in Italy, where he was likely to have developed a command of Italian; and it is certain from surviving letters in French that he had a command of that language as well. Early in his career he was attaché to Ferdinand's representative Pedro de Castilla, so it is likely that he acquired some proficiency in Spanish. We also know that, while in Turkey, Busbecq had a habit of copying Greek and Latin inscriptions. It is therefore likely that he was acquainted with Classical Greek, though evidently not with Modern Greek. He also explains some Turkish words in his letters, so he may have had an acquaintance with this language as well. It is also quite possible that he had learned German while in service in Vienna.

Sometime during his second and longer stay in Constantinople, Busbecq had occasion to meet with two envoys from the Crimea. One was evidently a native speaker of a Germanic language of the region, the other a native Greek speaker who had learned the Germanic language in question. From what Busbecq says, it appears that the Germanic speaker had lost much of his ability with his native tongue due to constant interaction with Greek speakers, and the Greek speaker evidently turned out to be the more competent in the Germanic language. From the letter it is unfortunately unclear as to which one of the gentlemen actually supplied the linguistic data. Most scholars are of the opinion that it was the native Greek speaker, a source of much consternation to present-day linguists because of the fact that his native tongue presumably interfered with his ability in the Germanic language. Neither is it clear what medium was employed in the interview: whether Busbecq interrogated the gentlemen directly (what language would he use for this?), or by means of interpreters (presumably via Greek). The letter raises as many questions as it answers.

Busbecq was certainly no newcomer to linguistic pursuits, and his letter clearly shows that he had an interest in investigating rare linguistic gems should occasion arise. Some of the modern scholarly literature has faulted Busbecq for his poor habits as a 'linguistic fieldworker', failing to employ a phonetically accurate orthography, failing to be consistent in orthographic practice, failing to identify the recorded forms clearly, failing to note the circumstances and method of his linguistic interview -- the list continues. But this should not be a surprise, since the data was collected sometime between 1555 and 1562, centuries before the advent of modern linguistic practices. For a man who was actually employed to negotiate a peace treaty between empires, we are lucky that he took the time he did to produce what may be the last surviving record of the East Germanic family of languages.

47 The Corpus of Crimean Gothic
The totality of primary texts concerning Crimean Gothic occupies roughly four manuscript pages. Of these, the bulk of the linguistic data proper occupies two pairs of columns, each column containing a word or, rarely, phrase of Crimean Gothic followed immediately by a Latin translation. There also appears a three-line song, or cantilena given space of its own, but which lacks the Latin gloss one would have hoped for. There are a few other words of Crimean Gothic set within the Latin text itself.

The entire corpus is short enough that it is worth reproducing here in full. Below, where there is continuous Latin text, this is placed to the left of its English translation. Where there are columns of Crimean Gothic with accompanying Latin, these have been set in three columns, the first Crimean Gothic, the next Latin, and finally an English translation of the Latin. The cantilena has no accompanying Latin translation, and so there is no English translation. The English translation is intended to be close to the Latin, word for word if possible, while at the same time making decent sense. No attempt is made at polished English prose.

 	 	Non possum hoc loco praeterire, quae de gente accepi, quae etiamnum incolit Tauricam Chersonesum, quam saepe audiveram sermone, moribus, ore denique ipso et corporis habitu, originem Germanicam referre.	 	I cannot pass over what I have learned about a race which still inhabits the Crimea, which I had often heard to resemble a Germanic origin in speech, customs, in features even and in bodily appearance.
 	 	Itaque me diu cupiditas tenuit videndi ab ea gente aliquem, et si fieri posset inde eruendi aliquid quod ea lingua scriptum esset, sed hoc consequi non potui. Casus tamen utcunque desiderio meo satisfecit.	 	For a while now the desire has held me of seeing someone from this race, and if it be possible to bring about, of eliciting from this one something which is written in that language, but this I was unable to achieve. Nevertheless happenstance eventually fulfilled my desire.
 	 	Cum essent duo huc illinc delegati, qui nescio quas querelas nomine eius gentis ad principem deferrent, meique interpretes in eos incidissent, memores quid eis mandassem si id usu veniret, ad prandium illos ad me adduxerunt.	 	Since there were here two delegates from that place, who were conducting I know not what business in the name of that race, and as my interpreters had chanced upon them, mindful of what I had charged them if such should come about, they therefore led them to me for a lunch.
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Alter erat procerior, toto ore ingenuam quandam simplicitatem praeferens, ut Flander videretur aut Batavus:	 	One of them was taller, displaying in his overall appearance a certain native simplicity, so that he looked like a Fleming or Dutchman:
 	 	alter erat brevior, compactiore corpore, colore fusco, ortu et sermone Graecus, sed qui frequenti commercio non contemnendum eius linguae usum haberet, nam superior vicinitate, et frequenti Graecorum consuetudine sic eorum sermonem imbiberat, ut popularis sui esset oblitus, interrogatus de natura et moribus illorum populorum, congruentia respondebat.	 	the other was shorter, with a stouter body, a swarthy color, Greek in origin and speech, but who with frequent interaction had a not disrespectable command of that language; for the first one on account of proximity and frequent dealings with Greeks had so taken in their speech as to have forgotten that of his own people; though when asked about the nature and customs of those peoples, he responded sensibly.
 	 	Aiebat gentem esse bellicosam, quae complures pagos hodieque incoleret, ex quibus Tartarorum regulus, cum expediret, octingentos pedites sclopetarios scriberet, praecipuum suarum copiarum firmamentum: primarias eorum urbes, alteram Mancup vocari, alteram Sciuarin.	 	He was saying that the race was a warlike one which inhabited many villages even today, from which the commander of the Tartars, when he would set out, would enlist eight hundred infantry armed with firearms, the primary foundation of his own forces; and that of their main cities, one was called Mancup, the other Sciuarin.
 	 	Ad haec multa de Tartaris eorumque barbarie: in quibus tamen singulari sapientia non paucos reperiri memorabat. Nam de rebus gravissimis interrogatos, breviter atque apposite respondere.	 	To this he added many things about the Tartars and their barbarism, but among whom he recounted not few were gifted with particular insight. For when they were asked about the most serious matters, they would respond concisely and to the point.
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Ea de caussa non temere dictitare Turcas, reliquas quidem nationes scriptam in libris habere sapientiam, Tartaros libros suos devorasse, ideo in pectoribus eam habere reconditam, quam promat cum opus sit, et veluti divina fundant oracula.	 	For this reason the Turks say not casually that, though other nations have wisdom written in books, the Tartars have devoured their books, and have it so stored in their breast, and produce it as the occasion warrants, that they issue something like divine oracles.
 	 	Eosdem esse perquam immundis moribus: si iurulentum aliquid apponatur in mensa, nulla requirere coclearia, sed ius vola manus haurire. Enectorum equorum carnem devorare, nullo foco admotam, offas tantum sub equestri sella explicare, quibus equino calore tepefactis tanquam opipare conditis vesci.	 	These same ones have the most terrible habits: if some soup is placed on the table, they require no spoon, but rather the custom is to eat with the palm of the hand. They devour the meat of dead horses, served with no flame, but only lay out the pieces under a horse's saddle, and thus warmed by the horse's heat they eat them as if they were lavishly spiced.
 	 	Gentis regulum e mensa argentea cibum capere, primum inferri ferculum caput equi, ut et postremum, quemadmodum apud nos primo novissimoque loco honos habetur butyro.	 	The chief of this people takes his food from a silver table; the head of a horse is brought in as the first dish, and also the last, just as with us the honor of the first and last dish is held by butter.
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Nunc adscribam pauca vocabula de multis quae Germanica reddebat, nam haud minus multorum plane diversa a nostris erat forma: sive quod eius linguae natura id ferat, sive quod eum fugiebat memoria et peregrina cum vernaculis mutabat: omnibus vero dictionibus praeponebat articulum tho aut the.	 	Now I will write down a few words of the many which sounded Germanic; for no less had many a form clearly different from ours, either because the nature of the language might cause this, or because his memory escaped him and he was mixing foreign words with native ones. Indeed, he would place the article tho or the before all his words.

Moreover he recited a song from this language, whose beginning was like this:

 	 	Hi Gothi an Saxones sint, non possum diiudicare.	 	Whether these be Goths or Saxons is not possible to discern.
 	 	Si Saxones, arbitror eo deductos tempore Caroli magni, qui eam gentem per varias orbis terrarum regiones dissipavit. Cui rei testimonio sunt urbes Transilvaniae hodieque Saxonibus incolis habitatae. Atque ex iis ferocissimos fortasse longius etiam summoveri placuit in Tauricam usque Chersonesum, ubi quidem inter hostes religionem adhuc retinent Christianam.	 	If Saxons, I suspect that they were brought down in the time of Charles the Great, who scattered that people through the various parts of the world. As a testament to this fact there are Transilvania towns which even today are inhabited by Saxon settlers. And so perhaps it seemed fitting to move the most fierce of these even farther, all the way to the Crimea, where even among enemies they still retain the Christian religion.
 	 	Quod si Gothi sunt, arbitror iam olim eas sibi sedes tenuisse Getis proximas. Nec erraturum fortasse, qui sentiat maiorem partem eius intervalli, quod est inter Gothiam insulam et Procopiam, quam hodie vocant, a Gothis aliquando insessam. Hinc diversa Gothorum, Westgothorum et Ostrogothorum nomina: hinc peragratus orbis victoriis et seminarium ingens barbaricae multitudinis.	 	But if they are Goths, I suspect that they have held these regions for themselves beside the Getae for a long time already. Perhaps he would not be mistaken, if one thought that the greater part of that expanse which exists between the island Gotland and what they now call Perekup was once settled by Goths. From here came the various names of the Goths, the West Goths and the Ostrogoths; from here a traversal of the world through victories and the great nursery of the barbaric horde.
 	 	Habes quae de Taurica Chersoneso ex his Procopiensibus didici.	 	Now you have what I learned about the Crimea from these men of Perekup.
In the course of subsequent copying and typesetting, it is possible that errors may have crept into the text. For example, some suggest that in setting one of the columns of the word lists, some letters may have fallen out and been incorrectly replaced. In this way, CG Thurn received the final n which properly belonged to CG Kor, and CG Fisct received the final t which properly belonged to CG Hoef. The proper words should thus be: CG *Thur, *Korn, *Fisc, *Hoeft. Others also suggest that the gloss Ego dico 'I say' for CG Ich malthata is an error for Ego dixi 'I said'; similarly the gloss Voluntas 'wish' for CG Borrotsch is a misprint for Voluptas 'pleasure'. Stearns (1978) proposes the following emendations:

48 Phonology
The phonology of Crimean Gothic is both the primary avenue of investigation into the language and the greatest source of consternation. The difficulty stems from the manner in which the linguistic data was gathered and transmitted. Interpretation of the phonology of the corpus as received suffers from three basic problems:

the informant: Whichever of the two gentlemen from the Crimea provided the linguistic data, he was either a Greek by birth, or a native speaker of Crimean Gothic more competent in Greek than in his own native tongue. In either scenario, one may be certain that the pronunciation of Crimean Gothic words was colored by some degree of interference from Greek phonology of the region and period.
the fieldworker: Busbecq himself was known to be competent in several languages. Nevertheless, his native language presumably colored his understanding of the sounds he heard. In addition, as is clear from the letter, Busbecq had already formed preconceptions as to the nature of the language and its possible origin. This, coupled with his competence in other languages, perhaps resulted in his amendment of certain words to conform with those of languages he knew and to which he believed the language of the informants to be related.
the transmission: Busbecq's original letter appears to have suffered from both scribal emendation and error, introducing a certain degree of uncertainty in some instances as to what it was that Busbecq intially wrote.
Corrections which may be due to the last point have been touched upon in the preceding section. Below we discuss issues related to the informant's linguistic skills and Busbecq's own skills and practices.

48.1 Informant Interference
Most scholars interpret Busbecq's letter as suggesting that it was in fact the native Greek speaker who was the primary source of the Crimean Gothic material. If so, it is especially important to understand the sounds of his native language, since we expect that he will be more apt to preserve those phonological distinctions of Crimean Gothic which are paralleled in his own language than those which are not distinguished in his native tongue. What then was the phonological structure of the Greek which the informant spoke?

Stearns (1978) suggests the following line of reasoning. We may presume that, because of the Greek speaker's familiarity with the region, he may have been born in or near the Crimea and probably spoke the Greek found in that region at that time. We may call this language Crimean Greek of the 16th century. Inasmuch as there is scant evidence for the exact nature of this variety of Greek during this period, we must look for some indirect method to discover its characteristics.

It turns out that in the late 18th century the Tartars persecuted the Christians of the Crimea, and these Christians requested from Catherine II permission to settle in Russian territory. This was granted, and many of them, among them a large number of Greek speakers, eventually settled in the city of Mariupol (Zhdanov) in the Ukraine, beside the sea of Azov. The dialect of these Greek speakers, which we may term Mariupol Greek (MGk), survived into the 20th century. As it ultimately stems from the Greek spoken by natives of the Crimea, we may tentatively equate Mariupol Greek with Crimean Greek (CGk). We then further assume that MGk, hence CGk, has undergone little change in the centuries between the gathering of current linguistic data and the time period of Busbecq's visit to the Crimea. These assumptions are all speculative, but provide at least some starting point for an assessment of the pertinent phonology.

From studies of Mariupol Greek, we find that this dialect does in fact differ from standard Modern Greek in some ways. The consonants of Mariupol Greek, and thus Crimean Greek, are given in the chart below:

CGk Consonants	 	 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Palatal (Alveolar)	 	Velar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stops	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	/p/	 	/t/, /t'/	 	 	 	/k/
 	 	Voiced:	 	/b/	 	/d/	 	 	 	[g] = /k/
Fricatives	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	/f/	 	/þ/	 	 	 	/x/
 	 	Voiced:	 	/v/	 	/ð/	 	 	 	/ḡ/
Sibilants	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	 	 	/s/	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiced:	 	 	 	/z/	 	 	 	 
Affricates	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	 	 	/c/ = [ts]	 	/š/	 	 
 	 	Voiced:	 	 	 	 	 	/ž/	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasals	 	 	 	/m/	 	/n/	 	 	 	[ŋ] = /n/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Liquids	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Continuant:	 	 	 	 	 	/l/	 	 
 	 	Trilled:	 	 	 	 	 	/r/	 	 
Semi-Vowels	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	/j/	 	 
Here the symbol þ is used rather than the more usual theta in keeping with our focus on Gothic. There does not appear to be any distinction between long and short consonants in MGk. In addition, MGk preserves the distinction of voiced and voiceless consonants, and word-final consonants do not undergo devoicing.

The vowels of Mariupol Greek, and so Crimean Greek, are shown in the following chart:

CGk Vowels	 	Front	 	 	 	 	 	Back	 	 	 	 
 	 	Unrounded	 	 	 	Rounded	 	Unrounded	 	Rounded	 	 
 	 	 	 	[i]	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[u.]
High	 	/i/	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	/u/	 	 
 	 	 	 	[ɨ]	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[u]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	[e]	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[o.]
Middle	 	/e/	 	[ej]	 	 	 	 	 	/o/	 	 
 	 	 	 	[je]	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[o]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	/a/	 	 	 	 
A period immediately following a vowel indicates a tense pronunciation. MGk apparently does not phonemically distinguish vowel length. Several of the phonemes had allophonic variants, indicated in square brackets in the column following the phoneme. In particular, the phoneme /e/ had phonetic variants including palatal on- and off-glides. MGk [je] appears for /e/ in initial position, so that [jéma] corresponds to Modern Greek [éma]; likewise MGk [ej] occurs for /e/ in one-syllable words, so that MGk [psejs] corresponds to Modern Greek [pses].

We may now consider a few examples of how our knowledge of MGk phonology, and hence CGk phonology, provides us with a method by which to interpret the Crimean Gothic corpus.

We are in a position to determine the reflex of PGmc *e in Crimean Gothic. Consider the word Busbecq transcribes as seis. The diphthong may be Busbecq's rendering of what the Greek-speaking informant pronounced as [sejs]. This mid-front vowel with palatal off-glide, however, is the Greek informant's allophone for /e/ in monosyllabic words. Hence we expect the informant's [sejs] to correspond to CG /ses/. Thus CG /e/ corresponds to PGmc *e. Compare BG saíhs, ON sex, OHG sehs.

Consider also the initial the initial ie of the words written Iel, Ies. Some scholars have taken ie to represent long [ī]. This is possible, but the allophones of CGk /e/ provide an alternate explanation. Since the CG ie appears in initial position, we might expect this to represent a palatal on-glide introduced by the informant. Thus the informant's [jes] may represent CG /es/. Compare Runic eR, OHG er from PGmc *es. In addition, since CGk does not distinguish vowel length, we may suspect that CGk /e/ represents a possible CG /ē/. Then we find in initial position [je] < CG /ē/, which is perhaps the CG reflex of the PGmc diphthong *ai. Then CG Iel = /ēl/, for which compare BG háils and OHG heil 'well', with loss of initial h-.

As regards consonants, we may recall that final voiced consonants in CGk are not devoiced. In this context we note the following correspondences:

Meaning	 	Old English	 	Old Saxon	 	Crim. Goth.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
'blood'	 	blōd	 	blōd	 	Plut
'old'	 	eald	 	ald	 	Alt
'ring'	 	hring	 	hring	 	Rinck
The final consonants in the CG reflexes are clearly devoiced, and this devoicing cannot be presumed to be a result of interference from the informant's native language. Thus we find that devoicing of final PGmc consonants is a feature of CG itself.

The initial p in CG Plut 'blood' poses an interesting challenge. In this position we expect the voiced plosive b, as in BG blōþ, since other words give us no indication that an initial PGmc *b should be treated specially. Compare the following: CG Broe 'bread' (cf. OE brēad, OHG brōt), CG Bruder 'brother' (cf. BG brōþar), CG Boga 'bow' (cf. ON bogi, OS, OHG bogo), CG Bars 'beard' (cf. OE beard, OHG bart), CG Brunna 'fountain' (cf. BG brunna). Given that Plut is the sole exception, it is quite possible that the p is simply a misprint. If not, we must seek another explanation. Since the informant's native tongue distinguishes voiced and voiceless consonants in all positions, we must assume that this represents a true CG [p]. It is then possible that CG had two allophones for /b/, one strongly voiced [b], and one weakly voiced [p]. The latter occurred in initial position when followed by /l/.

A similar explanation may apply to the unexpected occurrence of t in Tag 'day' and th in Thurn 'door'. These presumably represent the same voiceless plosive [t], where we would otherwise expect [d] from PGmc *d, cf. BG dags, OS duri, OHG turi. The PGmc *d in fact occurs as CG [d] in other places: Handa (cf. BG handus, ON hǫnd, OS hand) and CG fyder (cf. BG fidwor, fidur-). As with CG /b/, we may assume that CG /d/ < PGmc d had two allophones. One was lightly voiced and equivalent to [t], occurring for initial /d/; the other was voiced, and occurred for /d/ between sonorants, i.e. resonants and vowels.

An unfortunate property of the CGk phonemic inventory is that it lacks the glottal fricative /h/, which we would expect to develop at some stage in the history of CG from PGmc *x if the other Germanic languages are any indication. If such a phoneme was in fact present in CG, we would expect the Greek-speaking informant to substitute either [x] or zero. Unfortunately we find the confusing situation in which the CG corpus shows both the expected h in certain words and zero in others:

Change	 	Crim. Goth.	 	Gothic	 	Old English	 	Old Saxon	 	Old High German	 	Old Norse	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*x > h	 	Hus	 	 	 	hūs	 	hūs	 	hūs	 	hūs	 	'house'
 	 	Hoef	 	háubiþ	 	hēafod	 	hōbid	 	houbit	 	 	 	'head'
 	 	Handa	 	handus	 	hand	 	hand	 	hant	 	hǫnd	 	'hand'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*x > zero	 	Ano	 	hana	 	hana	 	hano	 	hano	 	hane	 	'cock'
 	 	Ieltsch	 	háils	 	hāl	 	hēl	 	heil	 	heill	 	'well'
This could be an idiosyncracy of the informant, employing [x] in some words, zero in others. Perhaps more likely, however, is that PGmc *x was in fact lost in CG, and that it was Busbecq's own knowledge of Dutch and German orthography which lead him to write an h in words which were in fact pronounced without [x]. Note that the words with h, Hus, Hoef, Handa, appear in the list of those words which Busbecq believed to be quite similar to his own, while Ano and Ieltsch appear in the list of words which sounded fairly dissimilar to the Germanic languages with which he was familiar.

48.2 Fieldworker Interference
Busbecq was fluent in a number of languages, and familiar with still others. Therefore the number of different language sounds with which he was familar must have been considerable. Some scholars have suggested, however, that Busbecq was not entirely familiar with [þ], hearing the sound instead as [ts], and therefore transcribing tz. Consider the following examples: CG Goltz 'gold' (cf. BG gulþ), CG Statz 'land' (cf. BG dat. sg. staþa, OS stað, OHG stad, stado 'shore'), and CG Tzo 'thou' (cf. BG þu, OE þu, ON þú).

However this same familiarity with a number of languages may have been a hindrance in the area of orthography. It is clear from the letter that Busbecq already had certain preconceived notions of the relationship the language under investigation had to other Germanic languages. It appears that in certain respects he allowed his transcription of the informant's words to be colored by the orthographic conventions of other languages, particularly Netherlandic and German writing conventions.

Busbecq's transcription ie may have represented the long vowel ī, since this was the practice in Middle Netherlandic and Early New High German. This is likely the intention in the transcription Meira 'ant' and Schieten 'shoot', which mimic Middle Netherlandic miere and schieten. Given the lack of phonemic distinction between long and short vowels in CGk, however, the informant likely pronounced a short vowel. We have also discussed above how the ie found in CG Ies, Iel, and Ieltsch likely represents the palatal on-glide of the informant's initial [je], and not the monophthong [ī]. If this is true, it shows that Busbecq suffered some inconsistency in employing letters for transcription.

As discussed in the preceding subsection, h is particularly problematic. Its apparent inconsistency on Proto-Germanic grounds is likely the result of Busbecq's own orthographic habits. This letter appeared in the Middle Netherlandic words huus, hovet, hant and in Early New High German haus, haupt, hand(t). What is more, Busbecq was accustomed to writing this letter in initial position before a vowel, since in his native Flemish [h] was lost in just this position, though inconsistently retained in the writing. This strengthens the argument outlined above, that [h] was lost in initial position in Crimean Gothic, but Busbecq inserted the letter in the writing of those words closest to those of the Germanic languages with which he was familiar.

Scholarly opinion varies on what the transcription tz actually represents. This digraph only occurs in places where one expects PGmc *þ, though *þ also appears as t, th, and d. It could of course be a misprint, but the correspondences with *þ are not chance, so that this is not likely. As mentioned above, Busbecq may have misunderstood [þ] as [ts] and thus written tz. On the other hand, he may have been attempting to transcribe the voiced fricative [ð]. But since the informant would have distinguished [ð] and [þ], he may have pronounced [ð] in CG Tzo 'thou', but it is less likely in Goltz and Statz. In the end, Busbecq likely heard CG [þ] correctly, but was confounded in how to transcribe it. Perhaps tz was his solution to this dilemma.

49 Morphology
Unfortunately Busbecq has left us with few complete phrases with which to analyze syntactic relations and the morphology which marks those relations. Instead what we have are for the most past isolated forms devoid of context. This leaves any identification of morphological form tentative at best.

49.1 Substantives
Scholars generally agree that Crimean Gothic distinguished gender, case, and number, though it is difficult to tell from the data available just to what degree. If we are correct in interpreting both s and sch as representations of CG /s/, then several words may show that CG retained the PGmc nominative singular masculine ending -z as CG /s/. Consider the following examples: CG VVintch 'wind' (if a misprint for *VVintsch, cf. BG winds), CG Fers 'man' (cf. BG faírƕus), CG Rintsch 'mountain', CH Borrotsch 'desire'. The CG phrase Knauen tag may display the ending of the accusative masculine singular. Compare the accusative singular BG dag, ON dag, OE dæg, OS dag, OHG tag. Only CG Oeghene 'eyes' has a plural gloss. This perhaps represents a nominative or accusative plural form, as with BG áugōna, ON augo, OE ēagen, OS ōgun, OHG ougun.

The phrases preserve some of the CG pronouns. In particular we find CG Ich 'I' (cf. BG ik, ON ek, OE ic, OS ik, OHG ih), as well as CG Tzo 'thou' (cf. BG þu, ON þú, OE þū, OS þū, OHG dū). We also have the masculine third person pronoun CG Ies 'he' (cf. BG is, ON er). The letter may also provide examples of the accusative singular of a third person neuter enclitic pronoun CG -(a)ta, if it is correct to interpret phrases like Ich malthata as 'I say it'. Compare BG ita, OS it, OHG iz. A different interpretation takes the pronoun to be a demonstrative CG thata, so that Ich malthata would mean 'I say that'. Compare BG þata, ON þat, OE þæt, OS that, OHS daz.

Among adjectives, CG Ieltsch 'healthy' may employ the transcription sch to reflect a strong nominative singular masculine ending CG /s/, and is thus equivalent to BG háils. The adjectives CG Alt 'old' and Telich 'foolish', lacking either transcription s or sch, may show strong neuter nominative/accusative singular endings, similar to BG blind. The pronominal alternate ending for this form, akin to BG blindata, may also be in evidence in the transcriptions -ta and -tha of the following adjectives: CG Atochta 'bad' (Lat. Malum), CG VVichtgata 'white' (perhaps misprinted for *VVitgata; Lat. Album), CG Gadeltha 'beautiful' (Lat. Pulchrum). Each of the Latin glosses shows the neuter nominative/accusative singular form. The adjective CG Knauen 'good' likely represents the strong masculine accusative singular ending, akin to BG blindan.

49.2 Verbs
Busbecq's data provides us with a number of infinitive verb forms, all ending in CG -en: CG Schieten 'to shoot an arrow' (written in the manuscript with a lift over the e, rather than the n itself; Lat. Mittere sagittam), CG Schlipen 'to sleep' (Lat. Dormire), CG Kommen 'to come' (Lat. Venire), CG Singhen 'to sing' (Lat. Canere), etc.

The two verb forms CG Vvarthata and Varthata (both likely representing *VVarthata) are glossed with the Latin perfect indicative, first and second person singular, respectively. These could be disyllabic preterite forms, analogous to the plural forms of BG, e.g. nasidēdum 'we saved'; this would then show that such disyllabic forms were extended to the singular in CG. However, such a conclusion might be obviated by reading the final sequence -(a)ta or -thata as neuter accusative pronouns. In this regard, the manuscript glosses the phrase CG Ich malthata as 'I say' (Lat. Ego dico). Since this form appears the same as the preceding, and those are glossed as preterites, most scholars take Lat. Ego dico 'I say' to be a misprint for Ego dixi 'I said'. However, reading the final two syllables as a neuter direct object allow the manuscript reading to stand, and perhaps this shows the first person singular, present indicative active.

The phrase CG Kilemschkop 'drink up your cup' is glossed as a Latin imperative. Reading the final syllable -kop as the CG word for 'cup', then that leaves Kilemsch as a second person singular imperative. The phrase CG Iel vburt 'may it be well' is glossed with the Latin present subjunctive. The form CG vburt, perhaps for *vvurt, may be a third person singular past subjunctive (optative): cf. OHG wurti from werdan.

50 Syntax
There are a meagre few phrases in the Crimean Gothic corpus from which we can even hope to begin a study of the language's syntax. Most regrettably, the cantilena (song)

 	 	Wara wara ingdolou
 	 	Seu te gira Galtzou
 	 	Hoemisclep dorbiza ea.
does not even contain a gloss. This is a particular blow, because this is the only possible passage which may have contained multiple clauses, or at least one extended clause. What we are left with, then, are the following phrases:

 	 	Crimean Gothic	 	Latin	 	English
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Knauen tag	 	Bonus dies	 	good day
 	 	Iel vburt (*vvurt)	 	Sit sanum	 	may it be well
 	 	Tzo Vvarthata	 	Tu fecisti	 	thou hast made, done
 	 	Ies Varthata	 	Ille fecit	 	he made, did
 	 	Ich malthata	 	Ego dico	 	I say
 	 	Kilemschkop	 	Ebibe calicem	 	drink up your cup
If we take CG -thata to be a pronoun, then we may make the following analysis:

 	 	Subject	 	Verb	 	Object	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Tzo	 	Vvar	 	-thata	 	thou hast made that
 	 	Ies	 	Var	 	-thata	 	he made that
 	 	Ich	 	mal	 	-thata	 	I say that
Assuming the informant made no syntactic errors, then it appears that CG is tentatively a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language. Such an identification must be qualified, however, by the structure of the phrase CG Knauen tag '(I bid you) good day'. This presumably shows an attributive adjective preceding the noun it modifies, which is a feature generally associated with SOV languages. If similar to other Germanic languages of a similar time period, Crimean Gothic was likely an SVO language which retained remnants of an earlier period of SOV word order.

If the phrase CG Kilemschkop 'drink up your cup' is actually to be analyzed as an imperative Kilemsch and direct object -kop, then it appears imperative forms occupy first position in an utterance. This order need not hold, however, if the verb is subjunctive: CG Iel vburt 'may it be well' appears to be verb final.

Selected Annotated Bibliography

Texts
There are few available editions of the Gothic corpus as a whole, the most accessible sources being the reading excerpts contained in the grammars listed in the next section. There are, however, two outstanding editions of Gothic texts listed below. The first is unforunately long out of print, and the second is reprinted periodically.

Gerhard H. Balg, The First Germanic Bible. Milwaukee: self-published, 1891. This work contains the Gothic text of the Bible, as well as the other main remains of the Gothic language. One of the few editions in English, particularly amusing for employing a reformed spelling of Modern English (e.g. tho for though). It contains a complete dictionary of the language. An even more striking feature is a remarkably extensive treatment of syntax, though more along the lines of standard grammars of Latin and Greek (e.g. focusing on clauses of various types such as result clauses and purpose clauses), rather than in step with modern notions of syntax. In short an amazingly useful reference.
Wilhelm Streitberg, Die gotische Bibel. Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitaetsbuchhandlung, 1960. Two volumes. Simply put, this is the standard edition of the Gothic Bible by which all others are judged. Streitberg put considerable effort into reconstructing the form of the Greek Bible on which the Gothic translation was based, and the result is set on pages facing the accompanying Gothic. The second volume is a complete dictionary of the Gothic language, particularly interesting for its labelling of verbs as perfective or imperfective as per Streitberg's description of such terms in his Elementarbuch.
Grammars
There are a number of grammars of the Gothic language. Most of them are reference grammars and therefore not a user-friendly introduction to the language, Bennett's book being a notable exception. In addition, few of the grammars are in English.

Wilhelm Braune, Gotische Grammatik: mit Lesestuecken und Worterverzeichnis. Tuebingen: Niemeyer, 1973. One of the standard references in German. Includes readings and a glossary.
Wilhelm Streitberg, Gotisches Elementarbuch. Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitaetsbuchhandlung, 1910. Perhaps the single most useful reference grammar on Gothic. It stands out among all others by virtue of its lengthy treatment of syntax, given short shrift elsewhere. Includes reading passages and a glossary. In German.
Joseph Wright, Grammar of the Gothic Language. London: Oxford University Press, 1954. A nice, clear reference grammar, with a number of readings and glossaries. A thorough treatment of morphology, though some of the analysis is a little dated. A few pages of syntax are added as an afterthought. One of the few reference works available in English.
Wolfgang Krause, Handbuch des Gotischen. Munich: Beck, 1968. A reference grammar, with little attention given to matters of syntax. In German.
William H. Bennett, An Introduction to the Gothic Language. New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1980. This is an extremely useful introduction and a welcome departure from all other books this author has seen, they being mainly reference grammars with readings added as an afterthought. Bennett's book is a pedagogical introduction, though at times a little more terse than one would like. As nice feature is that at the final sections of most of the chapters, taken together, form a concise introduction to Germanic historical linguistics in general. Includes readings for each chapter and a self-contained glossary. In English.
Dictionaries
The text editions listed above, namely Balg's and Streitberg's, contain full dictionaries of the corpus (Balg's into English, Streitberg's into German). From the perspective of historical linguistics, the following work stands out.

Winfred P. Lehmann, A Gothic Etymological Dictionary. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1986. As noted in the work, this is based on the third edition of the Vergleichendes Woerterbuch der Gotischen Sprache by Sigmund Feist. In short, this is perhaps the single most useful work on the Gothic language besides the texts themselves. In a sense a topical dictionary, in that words etymologically related are generally listed under the same head word. It can, however, be used as a companion dictionary to the texts by employing the Gothic index near the back. Each head word is given a short discussion citing scholarly literature which is collected in the bibliography. Examples of etymologically related words from other languages are cited, and the index contains lists of all words referenced from languages Indo-European and not, grouped by language and family or subfamily. In English.
Linguistic History
The first source listed below is a book giving a general survey of the older Germanic languages and is a suitable introduction for the non-specialist. The articles that follow are scholarly works treating specific matters of Gothic, Germanic, and Indo-European historical linguistics.

Orrin W. Robinson, Old English and its Closest Relatives. London: Routledge, 1992. A truly fun and entertaining book to read, while at the same time scholarly and informative. A rare gem. Each of the major archaic Germanic languages is treated in a separate chapter, highlighting the way in which each differs from basic common Germanic characteristics as outlined in an early chapter. A short reading and accompanying glossary (with translations into English at the end of the book) are given in each chapter; when possible these are parallel versions of the Parable of the Sower and the Seed, to afford easy comparison between languages. The chapter on Gothic, as is to be expected in a work of this nature, is more superficial than these lessons. It is nevertheless informative for gaining perspective on how Gothic fits into the Germanic family. In English.

History
The works listed below treat the history of the Gothic people. Two of the works give broad overviews and interpretation of a vast amount of primary and secondary literature treating more or less the entire course of documented Gothic history. The work by Heather and Matthews, by contrast, is more limited in timespan and unique in providing primary source material in translation.

A well-written study of the Goths, particularly useful for its attempt to distinguish between different Gothic tribes in the period leading up to the advent of the Visigoths and Ostrogoths.

Peter Heather and John Matthews, The Goths in the Fourth Century. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1991. A singularly useful text, being a rare resource for actual primary texts concerning the Goths in English translation. Short and to the point, though with a broad range of coverage from archaeology, history, and language.
Herwig Wolfram, History of the Goths, translated from German by Thomas J. Dunlap. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988. The English version of this German text is actually a wonderful read. The author keeps the narrative flowing at a brisk pace, though pausing at times for interesting asides and analyses. Though a history text, this generally reads more like a novel, albeit with less character development. Unfortunately the asides, which look both forward and backward in time, can make following the sequence of events a little difficult at times. This makes the book's use as a reference a little more limited.

MacDonald Stearns, Jr., Crimean Gothic: analysis and etymology of the corpus. Saratoga, Calif: Anma Libri, 1978. A particularly thorough study of Crimean Gothic. At times going against previous scholarly opinion, a generally well-reasoned and solid account of the language and problems with its interpretation. Extremely informative, containing Busbecq's letter in facsimile, transcription, and translation, as well as a discussion of pertinent ancilliary materials. In English.
