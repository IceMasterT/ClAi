Old French Online

Like the other Romance languages, French is a daughter-language of Latin. Its standard variety traces back to one of the dialects of Old French, that is, the dialect spoken in the Ile de France, which has been for centuries the geographical and political center of what is France today.

Old French is one of the earliest attested Romance languages and offers a fascinating field for research in historical linguistics: not only are many of its changes attested in texts, but its linguistic ancestor, Latin, is richly documented as well.

1. Emergence of a New Language
When Rome expanded under Caesar and the Roman emperors, Latin became the dominant language in much of the Roman Empire. In many of the occupied territories Latin eventually ousted the vernacular languages, but ultimately split up in what are the Romance languages today. The Romance languages include Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Occitan, French, Sardinian, Rhaeto-Romance, Rumanian, and Romance Creoles.

Among these, (Old) French is the result of language contact between several languages representing different language groups: Celtic (Gaulish), Italic (Latin), and Germanic (e.g. Frankish, the language of the Franks).

Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 and 51 B.C., but the southern parts of the country had already been occupied by the Romans since 121 B.C. and therefore had already been colonized and Romanized. After Caesar's conquest, the Gauls -- speaking a variety of Gaulish dialects -- came in touch with Latin through contact with colonists, the military, tradesmen, and administrators. Even before the Roman conquest, Gaul had towns and a well-developed road system; its Romanization resulted in Latin becoming the predominant language -- a process that took several centuries.

Without going too much into detail, we mention here two aspects of the process of Romanization that were very important for the spread of Latin: education, and administration. State officials were sent to Gaul to take care of various administrative tasks, among them the tax system. At first these state officials came from Rome and therefore spoke Latin: Latin became the official language of administration. Soon however it became possible for the indigenous population to make a career in Roman administration as well, provided they spoke Latin. Latin therefore became an important means to achieve socio-economic success. In addition, because of the Roman school system, young generations of Gauls acquired a systematic knowledge of Latin. Moreover Latin had its own writing system, a rich written tradition, and represented a civilization that was politically, militarily, culturally, admininstratively, and economically the most advanced of its time. The socio-economic advantages Latin offered to those who knew it, and the fundamental willingness of the Gauls to accept it, explain why not only the Romanization but also the Latinization of Gaul was a success.

As noted, Latin gradually ousted Gaulish, which in fact left relatively few traces in the new language, mainly lexical: approximately seventy or so Gaulish words survive in French today, among them lieue 'mile', chemin 'road', charrue 'plow', mouton 'sheep', and others. Most of these words refer to agriculture and everyday life.

The invasion of the Germanic tribes in the 5th century A.D. marks the end of the Roman Empire in Western Europe and the beginning of the Frankish rule in the northern part of Gaul (up to the Loire). Although the Franks were in power, their language did not oust Gallo-Romance. The Franks did, however, leave a few traces in French, such as words starting with h-aspiré, as in haricot 'bean', which traces back to a Germanic word. Compare the h-muet in homme 'man'. Homme goes back to Latin hominem, which lost its initial h sound before the Frankish tribes occupied Gaul. Another Germanic feature is the existence and predominance of place names in northern regions France of the type Neuville, Neufchateau, Francheville, and others. In these formations the adjective precedes the noun, as they do in Germanic today. These structures are not attested in the south, where place names are found with the reverse order, noun + adjective: Villeneuve, Chateauneuf, Villefranche, and others.

The Frankish kings made important contributions to the development of France: with the conversion of Clovis to the Church of Rome (ca. 496 A.D.), the Church became important. The countryside was christianized; monasteries were founded, and soon became centers of activity and education. In the 8th century, Charlemagne wanted to re-create the Roman Empire, but in a Christian version. His reign marks a Renaissance: the civilization of Antiquity and its language were ideals one set out to realize. It is in the early 9th century that two events mark an important linguistic phenomenon. In 813 it was decided at the Concily of Tours that sermons would no longer be delivered in Latin, but rather in the vernacular language. Then in 842 two of Charlemagne's grandsons, Louis le Germanique and Charles le Chauve, took an oath in French and German, respectively, in front of their troops in Strassbourg; this proclamation of mutual support resulted in a written agreement, Les Serments de Strassbourg. These two events reflect the awareness of the speakers of the day that (1) the Gallo-Romance they spoke was a language separate and different from Latin, and (2) Gallo-Romance was a language different from German. The earliest text in French, therefore, is the Serments de Strassbourg; it marks, in fact, the political disintegration of centralized power that started at Charlemagne's death.

During the early Middle Ages, contacts among people were rather local in nature and therefore "vertical": most people lived and died in the region where they were born, and communicated with others living in the same region independently of their social background. The seigneur, for example, would communicate with his farmers and soldiers, and so forth. This phenomenon contributed greatly to the emergence of dialects.

Only later -- starting in the 12th century -- when pilgrimages, crusades, and universities came up and towns became more important, did contacts become "horizontal," cutting through geographical boundaries rather than social classes. Gradually the king once again became a central power. At that point one sees that the dialect of the Ile de France, where the kings established a fixed court, became increasingly important and in fact started the journey that eventually would lead to its standardisation. The historical background accounts for the fact that Old French had many local dialects.

2. Dialects
Although this course in Old French is too short to make dialect variation a topic of special interest, students should know that "Old French" in fact refers to a collection of dialects. Since some of these dialects share more characteristics than others, it is possible to divide them in two groups: the dialects spoken in the northern parts of France, to which one refers as language d'oïl and those spoken in the Southern parts, referred to as langue d'oc. Oc and oïl were markers of affirmation ('yes') in the respective dialect groups.

La language d'oïl includes the following dialects: the dialects of Picardie (le Picard), Normandy (le Normand), Ile de France (le Francien), Lorraine (le Lorrain), Anjou (l'Angevin), Poitou (le Poitevin), Bourgundy (le Bourguignon), and Berry (le Berrichon).

La langue d'oc includes the dialects of the following regions: Provence (le provenc/al), Auvergne (l'auvergnat), Gascony (le gascon), and Languedoc (le languedocien).

The differences between the dialects are primarily phonological. Lexical differences are also found, some of which may have grammatical effects. In Old French, negation is expressed with the negating particle ne, which may be reinforced by an element of nominal origin. The modern French ne ... pas negation traces back to this situation. Yet in Old French there were many other elements used as reinforcer in this context, for example mie 'crumb', point 'dot', goutte 'drop', and many others. In some regions pas predominated, in others e.g. mie. Eventually pas supplanted all other varieties and became the unique non-emphatic negating marker.

3. Grammatical Characteristics of Old French
Linguistically, Old French represents an intermediate stage between Latin and the modern language. A case in point is the case system: whereas Latin had a full-fledged case system with six cases, and modern French has none (except on pronouns), Old French had two cases, a subject and an oblique case.

Similarly, in the history of word order, an important change occurred in the transition from Latin to French: Latin was a verb-final language (Subject-Object-Verb, henceforth SOV); in French the verb from the earliest documents precedes the object (SVO). Old French therefore is an SVO language but its subordinate clauses are often still verb-final. In addition, word order in Old French allows for more variation and it is only later that sequences such as Complement + Verb + Subject disappear. The word order patterns observed in Old French remind us of those in today's German or Dutch. These languages, as well, are shifting from an earlier SOV to an SVO system.

As noted, Old French had a system of two cases: a subject case (nominative), and an object case (oblique). Yet the case distinction in nouns is formally marked in masculine nouns only. Case is more manifest in pronouns where, for the third person singular for example, there is a distinction between the direct object le/la and the indirect object li.

With a few exceptions, all nouns have number marking (singular vs. plural); and they are either masculine or feminine.

Case, number, and gender are also manifest in adjectival elements, such as adjectives and participles. The adjective, for example, agrees with the noun in case, number, and gender.

Another important characteristic of Old French, and an innovation with respect to Latin, is the use of definite articles. Old French definite articles trace back to Latin demonstratives, which in the history of Latin became more and more frequent and gradually lost their demonstrative value. The definite article in Old French primarily had a defining function. In contrast to modern uses, the definite article in Old French is not automatic. Like other nominal elements, definite articles are marked for gender, case, and number.

When the demonstratives lost their demonstrative value, new demonstratives developed: an element ecce 'behold' was added to the old demonstrative forms, iste and ille. As a result, Old French had two demonstratives (instead of three in Latin):

 	 	cist	 	< ecce + iste	 	'this'
 	 	cil	 	< ecce + ille	 	'that'
Most morphological processes are attested in the verb, which is marked for person, tense, mood, voice, and aspect:

Person:	 	1st sg.	 	2nd sg.	 	3rd sg.	 	 
 	 	1st pl.	 	2nd pl.	 	3rd pl.	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Tense:	 	Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Preterite	 	Imperfect	 	 	 	 
 	 	Future	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Mood:	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative	 	Conditional
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Voice:	 	Active	 	Passive	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Aspect:	 	Imperfective	 	Perfective	 	 	 	 
Some of the forms mentioned in this table are analytic (including an auxiliary and a main verb), while others are "synthetic." In synthetic forms, one verb form embodies the lexical element and all grammatical categories; cf.:

Analytic:	 	ai chanté	 	'I have sung'
Synthetic:	 	chantai	 	'I sang'
An important difference between Old French and later varieties is that the subject pronoun is not yet compulsory. In fact, it is rather infrequent.

In syntax, word order is predominantly SVO. Other sequences are motivated: SOV, for example, is typically attested in subordinate clauses; in commands, the imperative verb comes first.

Subject inversion is very common in Old French: it is triggered when a complement (direct, indirect, adverbial) is in clause-initial position, creating sequences such as Complement + Verb + Subject or Complement + Verb + Subject + Object.

In line with the predominance of SVO, other elements follow specific patterns as well: the genitive, for example, typically follows the head noun, with or without preposition, cf. e.g.

 	 	l'ost des Franceis
 	 	'the army of the French'
 	 	 
 	 	la fille le roi
 	 	'the daughter of the king'
Negation in Old French was characterized by one negating element ne, which precedes the verb. In addition there are many attestations of so-called "double" negation, as in:

 	 	autrement ne m'amerat il mie
 	 	'otherwise he will not love me'
In this example, negation includes an element ne and an element mie. In this construction the part ne + verb has been inherited from Latin. Adding a second element (mie) was a later development and not yet compulsory in Old French.

Compared to the modern language, nominal forms of the Old French verb played an important role: infinitive, participles, and gerunds. Yet, compared to Latin, these elements just play a minor role. In Old French, absolute constructions -- widespread in Latin -- are limited to specific verbs and typically specify the circumstances in which the action of the main verb is carried out, cf.:

 	 	juntes ses mains est alet a sa fin
 	 	'his hands joined he went to his death'
The infinitive in Old French may be nominalized, in which case a definite article generally is added; it may function as subject or complement, for example cf.:

 	 	li porters dou rainsel
 	 	'the fact of carrying the small branch'
 	 	 
 	 	tens est del hebergier
 	 	'it is time to encamp'
The use of an infinitive as complement of a finite verb is less strongly developed than in the modern language. In modern French the infinitive is automatically used when the subject of the finite verb and the infinitive are identical. In Old French this is not yet the case. Often a subjunctive, for example, is used instead, cf.:

 	 	Modern French:
 	 	je ne sais quoi faire
 	 	'I do not know what to do'
 	 	 
 	 	Old French:
 	 	ne sai que face [very common]
 	 	'I do not know what to do' (with subjunctive)
 	 	 
 	 	ne sai que faire [very rare]
 	 	'I do not know what to do'
4. Documents
A rich literature in Old French, along with many other documents, provide a wealth of texts covering the period from the 9th century until the end of the 13th century. From the end of the 13th century on, the case system disappears and the dialect of the Ile de France becomes increasingly important. That is why one no longer speaks of Old French, but rather of Middle French. Consequently the language of the 14th and 15th centuries is typically referred to as Middle French.

The texts selected for this course represent the various genres: the Chansons de geste, relating the exploits of Charlemagne and his nephew Roland; a hagiography, presenting the life of St. Alexis; a hymn written to praise the virtues of St. Eulalie; two examples of (early) littérature courtoise, Tristan and Yvain; an historical account of the Fourth Crusade; two texts representing the littérature bourgeoise, a fable and part of a play; and finally a translation of the well-known Latin text about St. Brendan, who set out to discover what may have been North America.

A striking characteristic of Old French texts is their international, European character. Some texts are based on foreign or international traditions or are translations or revisions of foreign texts. Moreover, the veneration of some saints is an international phenomenon, and the component of Irish culture, for example, is strong.

Lesson 1
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
La Chanson de Roland (The Song of Roland) is a so-called Chanson de Geste, one of the major genres of French medieval literature in the 12th and 13th centuries. In the Chansons de Geste the deeds (Latin gesta) of the great heroes of Christian lineage are described. As the oldest Chanson de Geste, the Chanson de Roland is generally dated in the early 12th century (ca. 1100-1120) and traces back to an historical event.

In 778, when Charlemagne crossed the Pyrenees returning from a campaign in Spain, the rearguard of his army was attacked and massacred by the local population. Toward the end of the 11th century, leading up to the First Crusade (1096-1099), this event developed legendary characteristics and the historical figures were interpreted as Christian heroes whose faith, loyalty, and courage in the battle against the pagan Saracens is continually praised, as in the Chanson de Roland.

In this epic two characters stand out: Charlemagne, king of the Franks, and Roland, his nephew and most prominent adviser and knight, who is the epitome of Christian heroism and sacrifice and who accepts martyrdom on the battlefield against the enemies of Christianity. The poem relates the events that lead to the betrayal and massacre as well as the battle itself; it describes not only the battle, in great detail, but also the deliberations that precede the decisions made by the main characters.

Translation
Charles the king, our great emperor,
has been in Spain a full seven years:
he conquered the high land up to the sea.
There is no castle that resists him;
there is no wall or town left to conquer,
except Saragossa, which is located on top of a mountain.
King Marsilie holds it, he who does not love God,
serves Mahomet and invokes Satan;
he cannot prevent that disaster reaches him there.
The emperor is ebullient as well as joyful:
he has taken Cordres and smashed the walls to pieces,
with his catapults he destroyed its towers;
his knights are laden with its booty
gold and silver and precious objects.
In the town no pagan is left
who has not been killed or become Christian.
The emperor is in a large orchard,
together with him are Roland and Oliver,
Sansun the duke and Anseis the proud one,
Gefreid of Anjou, the standard bearer of the king,
and Gerin as well as Gerer were there also;
Where these men were, there were many others:
from our beloved France there are fifteen thousand men.
The knights are seated on white precious cloths
to amuse themselves the most clever men and
the old men play games and chess,
and the pages, athletic, are fencing.
Under a pine tree, next to a wild rose,
they have a throne, entirely made of pure gold:
there the king is seated, who holds our beloved France.
He has a white beard and the head entirely greyish-white,
he has a fair body and a strong appearance:
if someone were to ask for him, it is not necessary to point him out.
And the messengers came down
and greeted him out of love and out of respect.
Grammar
1 Gender
Whereas the transition from Latin to French is characterized by the loss of the neuter, gender distribution itself is not fundamentally different in Old French: natural gender prevails for animate nouns, as in li uem vs. la feme ('the man' - 'the wife'), le filz - la fille ('the son' - 'the daughter), li tors 'the bull', la vache 'the cow', la jument 'the mare', and so forth. Inanimate nouns are either masculine or feminine and this so-called grammatical gender is unpredictable, with a few exceptions. Nouns in -or, for example tend to be feminine (e.g. la dolor 'the pain'). Because of wide-spread agreement patterns, gender marking is found in articles, demonstratives, possessives, adjectives, and participles.

2 Case: Nominal Declensions, Class I and Class II
Old French differs from all other stages of the language in that is still has declension of nouns. In the declension system of Old French, number and case are closely connected. The very large majority of nouns have a singular and a plural form. A limited number of nouns have a so-called collective singular: the singular refers to a single referent and to a group of persons or objects, as in fruit 'fruit' and 'fruits', or feuille 'leaf' and 'foliage'.

In Old French only two cases survive of the rich Latin nominal inflection. With Old Occitan, Old French differs fundamentally in this respect from from most other early Romance languages, which no longer have case marking on nouns; an important and well-known exception is Rumanian, where even today two nominal cases survive, a nominative-accusative and a genitive-dative.

The two cases that are found in Old French are the nominative and the so-called oblique case. The Old French nominative goes back to the Latin nominative, whereas the oblique case traces back to the Latin accusative, which assumed many functions from the other cases when they gradually disappeared in the development from Latin to Romance. Although Old French still distinguishes between the nominative and the oblique, these cases are not explicitly marked on all nouns. The majority of masculine nouns have distinct case forms; for feminine nouns the distinctions are primarily limited to number. It is possible to distinguish various classes.

Nominal Declensions, Class I

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	fame 'woman'	 	fames
Obl.	 	fame	 	fames
The majority of these nouns are feminine and go back to the Latin first declension in -a; they therefore end in -e in Old French, by regular phonological development. The class includes nominalized adjectives and participles as well, cf. force 'strength' from the Latin neuter plural fortia 'strong things'.

Note that for these nouns there is no formal distinction between cases, because the nominative is formally identical to the oblique case. The only formal distinction is between singular and plural.

The majority of Class II nouns are masculine and they have formal marking, represented by the ending -s, which follows the stem in the nominative singular and the oblique plural.

Nominal Declensions, Class II

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	murs (from La. murus) 'wall'	 	mur (from La. muri)
 	 	reis 'king'	 	rei
Obl.	 	mur (from La. murum)	 	murs (from La. muros)
 	 	rei	 	reis
Most of these nouns go back to nouns of the second declension in Latin, which were primarily masculine nouns as well. When the fourth declension disappeared, these nouns in -us became second declension nouns. This class of nouns further includes nominalized infinitives (li mangiers 'the meal') and nominalized participles and adjectives (Latin adj. diurnus 'daily' became Old French li jorz 'day').

3 Case: Hybrid Declensions
While not all feminine nouns end in -e, some masculine nouns do. This is the basis of what some scholars call "hybrid" declensions. Nouns in these classes have a declension pattern that does not correspond to what one might expect on the basis of the gender of the noun.

In practice this means that the case ending -s is used for feminine nouns that do not end in -e and that it lacks in some masculine nouns that do end in -e:

Nominal Declensions, Class Ia (feminine nouns)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	flors 'flower'	 	flors
Obl.	 	flor	 	flors
Words in this class most often in origin belonged to the third declension in Latin, such as amor 'love', mer 'sea', color 'color', dolor 'sorrow', loi 'religion', gent 'people', fin 'end', honor 'honor', main 'hand', valor 'worth', and others.

In the next class of nouns, the ending -s may or may not follow the stem.

Nominal Declensions, Class IIa (masculine nouns ending in ustressed -e)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	pere(s) 'father'	 	pere
Obl.	 	pere	 	peres
This declension includes nouns such as frere 'brother', gendre 'son-in-law', mestre 'master', arbre 'tree', ventre 'belly', livre 'book', archevesque 'archbishop', ermite 'hermit', and others.

Hybrid declensions are the result of the on-going breakdown of the case system, which started in early Latin. The development resulted not only in the loss of cases (compare the six cases of Latin to the two cases in Old French), but also in the disappearance of entire declensions (see the five declensions in Latin). Many nouns therefore moved from one declension to another on the basis of form or gender. Sometimes form and gender characteristics did not parallel, which led to declensional inconsistencies. In time the irregularities of declensions Ia and IIa disappeared, for example when the ending -s of the masculine singular spread, as in livre:

Nominal Declensions, Spread of -s

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	livres 'book' (earlier: livre)	 	livres
Obl.	 	livre	 	livres
4 Case Marking: Definite Articles and Adjectives
Case marking is also found in definite articles and adjectival elements, among them adjectives and participles.

4.1 Definite article declension
Case Marking, Definite Article

Masculine	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	li 'the'	 	li
 	 	li murs 'the wall'	 	li mur
Obl.	 	le	 	les
 	 	le mur	 	les murs
Case Marking, Definite Article

Feminine	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	la 'the'	 	les
 	 	la fame 'the woman'	 	les fames
Obl.	 	la	 	les
 	 	la fame	 	les fames
4.2 Adjectival declension
Like articles, adjectival elements agree with the noun in gender, number, and case. Adjectival inflection shows different patterns according to gender and to the declension the adjectives belong to.

Latin adjectives were divided into two groups or declensions. One included adjectives that distinguished a masculine, feminine, and neuter form (La. bonus, bona, bonum 'good') and the other declension -- the oldest one -- included those adjectives that distinguish between a masculine/feminine and a neuter form (La. fortis [masc./fem.] and forte [neuter] 'strong'). In Old French the first type of adjective follows the pattern of nominal Declension I when the adjective is feminine, and the pattern of nominal Declension II when the adjective is masculine. Past participles typically follow these patterns as well.

Adjectival Declension, Class I (feminine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	bone 'good'	 	bones
 	 	dure 'hard'	 	dures
 	 	entree 'enter' (Pf. Part.)	 	entrees
Obl.	 	bone	 	bones
 	 	dure	 	dures
 	 	entree	 	entrees
Adjectival Declension, Class II (masculine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	bons	 	bon
 	 	durs	 	dur
 	 	entrez	 	entré
Obl.	 	bon	 	bons
 	 	dur	 	durs
 	 	entré	 	entrez
Adjectives that follow these patterns include, e.g., sains 'holy', bruns 'brown', clers 'clear', fiers 'proud', legiers 'light, souple', tot 'all'.

Adjectives in -e follow the declension patterns of Class I feminine nouns when they are feminine and those of the Class II masculine nouns when they are masculine.

Adjectival Declension, Adjectives in -e (feminine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	sage 'wise'	 	sages
Obl.	 	sage	 	sages
Adjectival Declension, Adjectives in -e (masculine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	sages	 	sage
Obl.	 	sage	 	sages
Examples of adjectives of this category include e.g. amable 'amiable', foible 'feeble', riche 'rich'.

Adjectives in -re (e.g. povre 'poor') form a special group. The declension for feminine adjectives is regular, that of masculine adjectives lacks the -s suffix in the nominative singular.

Adjectival Declension, Adjectives in -re (feminine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	povre	 	povres
Obl.	 	povre	 	povres
Adjectival Declension, Adjectives in -re (masculine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	povre	 	povre
Obl.	 	povre	 	povres
Adjectives that follow this pattern include, among others: autre 'other', maigre 'thin', tendre 'tender'.

The archaic adjectival declension in Latin that originally distinguished animate (masc. or fem., e.g. fortis 'strong') vs. inanimate (neuter, e.g. forte ) survives in Old French in a declension pattern that does not include a suffix -e for feminine forms:

Adjectival Declension, Class III (feminine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	fort (forz) 'strong'	 	forz
Obl.	 	fort	 	forz
Adjectival Declension, Class III (masculine)

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	forz	 	fort
Obl.	 	fort	 	forz
Adjectives that are included are: brief 'short', cruel 'cruel', grant 'great', prod 'bold', vert 'green', fol 'foolish', and others.

5 Case Functions
The nominative primarily is the subject case and is used when addressing people, as in:

li reis tient la citet 'the king (Nom. Sg.) holds the town';
li empereres se fait balz (CdR 96, this lesson) 'the emperor (Nom. Sg.) is happy';
respunt li reis 'the king (Nom. Sg.) replies';
Deus, fet il 'God (Nom. Sg.), he said'.
The oblique case is used for all other functions, among them:

direct object of transitive verbs, as in
gent ad le cors (CdR 118, this lesson) 'he has a handsome body (Obl. Sg.)';
indirect object, as in
li nums Joiuse l'espee fut dunet (CdR 2508) 'the sword (Indir. Obj.) was given the name Joyeuse',
se Deu plet 'if it pleases (to) God (Indir. Obj.)';
genitive in combination with another noun, as in
la fille le rei 'the daughter of the king (Obl. Sg.)',
le rei gunfanuner (CdR 106, this lesson) 'the standard bearer of the king (Obl. Sg.)';
object of prepositions, as in
e dist al rei (CdR 27) 'and he sayd to the king (Obl. Sg.)';
li empereres est en un grant verger (CdR 103, this lesson) 'the king is in a large orchard (Obl. Sg.)';
adverbial expressions (e.g. space, time, direction), as in
set anz ad estet en Espaigne (CdR 2, this lesson) 'he has spent seven years (Obl. Pl.) in Spain'.

Lesson 2
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
When Charlemagne's army reaches France and the troops prepare themselves mentally to see their loved ones again, the rearguard under the command of Roland is attacked at Roncevaux. Despite the wise and urgent advice of his friend Oliver, Roland in his vanity refuses at first to blow the horn for military support. Only when Roland sees that many of his troops have died does he decide to call for Charlemagne's help. The physical effort of blowing the horn inflicts a fatal injury, and as a result Roland dies.

The Chanson describes in detail the last moments of Roland's life and his passing. When Charlemagne hears the signal, he returns to Spain to find that most of his men there have been killed, including Oliver and Roland. He prepares his revenge, which leads to the eventual victory of Christianity: the traitor is brought to justice, and Sarragossa eventually is taken.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The fragments below describe the most dramatic moments of the Chanson de Roland: Roland's blowing the horn, his injury, and his death. They also describe Charlemagne's arrival at the scene of the battle, and his emotions at seeing the disastrous effects of the attack (lines 1753-1758, 1785-1795, 2355-2365, 2396-2402, and 2412-2416).

The reader will notice that the fragments tend to be repetitive, which may be explained by the oral tradition that the Chanson de Geste was part of. The repetitive nature of the text also underscores the strong emotions that the events trigger in the characters. From a linguistic perspective, the reader will also notice that in many instances the case markers are not used, or are used incorrectly, illustrating the gradual disappearance of the case system.

Translation
Roland has put the horn at his mouth,
He places it solidly, with great force he blows it.
The mountains are high and the sound carries very far,
Thirty long miles away they heard it resonate.
Charles heard it, and all his troops.
The king spoke these words: "Our troops fight a battle!"
Count Roland has his mouth full of blood.
The temple of his brains has burst open.
He blows the horn in suffering and in pain.
Charles heard him and his subjects hear him.
The king spoke these words: "That horn has a long breath!"
Duke Naimes answers: "A brave knight is in distress!
There is a battle, to my knowledge.
He who has betrayed him, orders you to do nothing.
Arm yourself, and shout your war cry,
And go to the help of your fair army:
You hear very well that Roland is lamenting."
Roland feels that death overcomes him completely,
it descends from his head to his heart.
He has gone, running, under a pine tree,
there he has lain down on top of the green grass, face downwards,
he puts his sword and the horn under him,
he turned his head towards the pagan people:
He has done this for the reason that he really wants
that Charles and his entire people say
that he the brave count has died as a conqueror.
He confesses his sins aloud, tapping his chest quickly and frequently
For his sins he offered his glove to God.
Roland has died, God has his soul in heaven.
The emperor arrives in Roncevaux.
There is no road nor path,
nor any empty piece of ground, nor any ell or full foot,
where there is no Frenchman or heathen.
Charles cries out: "Where are you, my beloved nephew?"
...
"God!" the king said, "I can torment myself so much
for not having been there at the beginning of the battle!"
He pulls his beard like a man who is distressed;
His warrior knights shed tears from their eyes;
twenty thousand men faint on top of the earth.
Grammar
6 Case: Nominal Declension, Class III
In addition to the two declension classes discussed in Lesson 1, there is a third group of nouns in Old French, which is characterized by a varying number of syllables in the individual paradigms (the so-called imparisyllabic declension). This group of nouns traces back to the third declension in Latin (e.g. lex, legis), which included imparasyllabic nouns as well. Since the nominative singular had a number of syllables different from the other cases (e.g. La. imperator 'emperor-Nom.' vs. imperatorem 'emperor-Acc.'), the paradigm is characterized by a shift of accentuation, which affects the subsequent phonological changes. The following table presents the Latin forms and their Old French equivalents:

Nominal Declension, Latin vs. Old French

 	 	Nom. Sg.	 	Nom. Pl.
Latin:	 	imperator 'emperor'	 	imperatores
Old French:	 	emperedre	 	emperedor
 	 	Acc./Obl. Sg.	 	Acc./Obl. Pl.
Latin:	 	imperatorem	 	imperatores
Old French:	 	emperedor	 	emperedors
Nominal Declension, Class III

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	emperedre 'emperor'	 	emperedor
 	 	chantere 'singer'	 	chanteor
Obl.	 	emperedor	 	emperedors
 	 	chanteor	 	chanteors
Nouns included in this class are, for example: cuens, conte 'count', enfes, enfant 'child', niés, nevo 'nephew', sire, seignor 'lord', traïtre, traïtor 'traitor', and others. These nouns can be divided in four groups; three of them are:

masculine nouns referring to agents (verb stem + a suffix -eor or (i)ere), for example: chantere, chanteor 'singer', derived from the verb chanter (stem: chant-) 'sing' or buvere, buveor 'drinker' from the verb bevre (stem: buv-) 'drink';
masculine nouns, often of Germanic origin with a suffix -on for cases other than the nominative. These nouns are primarily nouns of persons or proper names. Examples include: ber, baron 'baron', lerre, larron 'thief', compaing, compaignon 'companion', Charles, Charlon 'Charles', Guenes, Ganelon 'Ganelon', and others;
feminine nouns that alternate the nominative singular with the other forms in -ain.
Nominal Declension, Feminine Nouns in -ain

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	la none 'the nun'	 	les nonains
Obl.	 	la nonain	 	les nonains
Examples include ante, antain 'aunt', pute, putain 'prostitute', niece, nieçain, 'niece', and others that are less frequent.

The fourth group in Class III consists of a variety of nouns, such as hom, home 'man', enfes, enfant 'child', sire, seignor 'lord'. These are all masculine nouns with the exception of suer, seror 'sister'.

Like the other declensional groups (Lesson 1), the case distinction gradually disappeared: the masculine nominative singular ending (-s) spread to nouns that originally did not have it, as sire > sires (which gives the following paradigm: li sires, le seigneur, li seigneur, les seigneurs). Moreover, one of the two forms, the nominative or oblique, came to be generalized to the rest of the paradigm; most commonly it was the oblique form that generalized: e.g. li gars vs. le garçon 'boy' became li garçons vs. le garçon (plural: li garçon and les garçons). This process came to completion in the Middle French period, when the oblique form eventually was the only form left. In the 13th century, a limited number of (animate) nouns developed double paradigms, each based on the nominative vs. oblique stem, cf:

Nominal Declension, Development of sire

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	li sire	 	li sire
Obl.	 	le sire	 	les sires
Nominal Declension, Development of seigneur

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	li seigneurs	 	li seigneur
Obl.	 	le seigneur	 	les seigneurs
7 Verb Conjugation: Present and Past
The verb in Old French expresses person, number, tense, mood, and to some extent aspect. Verb forms typically do not have an obligatory subject personal pronoun, so chant means 'I sing'. Cf. also: chante 'he sings' vs. li reis chante 'the king sings'. A verbal paradigm typically has three forms in the singular (1st, 2nd, and 3rd person) and three in the plural. The majority of the forms are "synthetic," which means that a unique form expresses the entire verbal concept, e.g. fenissons 'end-Present-we'.

Several forms are "analytic," which means that an auxiliary is combined with the main verb, generally the perfective participle or an infinitive. Compare: chant 'I sing' vs. ai chanté 'I have sung'.

On the basis of the ending of the infinitive, we distinguish four conjugations in Old French: verbs in -er, -ir, -oir, and in -re. Of these the verbs in -er and most verbs in -ir are so-called regular verbs. It is accurate to say that as a rule of thumb the verbs in -er, which are most frequent, trace back to the first conjugation verbs in Latin (e.g. Latin cantare survives as chanter in Old French).

There are two types of verb in -ir: those that include an infix -iss- in some forms, and those that do not. The infix traces back to the Latin infix -isc-, an inchoative marker, which conveys the notion of 'to begin', as in tepesco 'I become warm', based on tepeo 'I am warm'. Reflecting this etymological origin, many verbs in -ir are formed on adjectives (OFr. adj. sage 'wise' > v. assagir 'become wise', adj. riche 'rich' > v. enrichir 'become rich'); others are in origin Germanic verbs (e.g. rôtir 'roast', choisir 'choose').

Verbs in -oir go back to second conjugation verbs in -ere in Latin (e.g. Latin manere 'stay' vs. OFr. manoir 'stay'). Verbs in -re trace back to the Latin verbs in -re.

Verbal Conjugation, Verbs in -er, Present Indicative (chanter)

Present	 	Ending	 	Sg.	 	Ending	 	Pl.
1st pers.	 	-	 	chant 'I sing'	 	-ons	 	chantons
2nd pers.	 	-es	 	chantes	 	-ez	 	chantez
3rd pers.	 	-e	 	chante(t)	 	-ent	 	chantent
In some verbs, the accent is on the verb ending throughout the entire paradigm; in others, it shifts to the verb stem for certain forms (1st sg., 2nd sg. and 3rd sg. and pl. present indicative and present subjunctive, and 2nd sg. imperative). This accounts for an alternation pattern, as in the verb amer:

The Old French verb has two past tenses, an imperfective (which traces back to the Latin imperfective in -bam, for example cantabam 'I sang') and a preterite (Fr. passe/simple), which goes back to the Latin perfective form, e.g. cantavi 'I have sung'. Latin cantabam survived as chantoie in Old French; Latin cantavi survived as chantai in Old French.

The imperfective and preterite forms for the various conjugations in Old French are as follows.

8 Avoir and Estre
The verbs avoir and estre in Old French have two functions: they function as full lexical elements and as auxiliairies. Avoir is, first of all, a verb of possession; in addition it is used in a common impersonal construction (see Grammar Point 10), and it is an important tense auxiliary (see Grammar Point 9). Estre is a lexical verb conveying existence, a copula, and an auxiliary. The conjugations of both verbs are as follows:

9 Compound Tenses
While Latin only had one auxiliary, esse, which combined with the perfective particle (e.g., laudauts est 'he is in the state resulting from the praising'), French from its earliest stage had two, estre and avoir, as the following examples show:

Auxiliary estre:

alez est en un verger (CdR 11)
'he went into an orchard'
murs ne citét n'est remés a fraindre (CdR 5, Lesson 1)
'there is no wall or town left to conquer'
Auxiliary avoir:

li reis m'ad tramis ses messages (CdR 181)
'the king has sent me his messages'
set anz ad estet en Espaigne (CdR 2, Lesson 1)
'he has spent seven years in Spain'
In Old French the auxiliaries combine with the perfective participle to form four so-called analytic verb forms or compound tenses: present perfect, past perfect (or pluperfect), future perfect, and conditional perfect. For example:

Present Perfect:	 	ai chanté	 	'I have sung'
Past Perfect:	 	avoie chanté	 	'I had sung'
Future Perfect:	 	avrai chanté	 	'I will have sung'
Conditional Perfect:	 	avroie chanté	 	'I would have sung'
In Old French, estre is not only a tense auxiliary but a passive auxiliary as well, as the following examples show:

estre, tense auxiliary:

alez est en un verger (CdR 11)
'he went into an orchard'
estre, passive auxiliary:

la traïsun ne poet estre celee (CdR 1458)
'the treason cannot be kept secret'
In general transitive verbs combine with avoir in compound tenses, while intransitive verbs combine with estre, as in the following examples:

Transitive verb + avoir

li reis m'ad tramis ses messages (CdR 181)
'the king has sent me his messages'
Intransitive verb + estre

alez est en un verger (CdR 11)
'he has gone into an orchard'
Some verbs combine with avoir or estre according to whether their use is transitive or intransitive, cf.:

morir, intransitive use ('die'):

morz est Rollant (CdR 2397, this lesson)
'Roland has died'
paien sunt morz a millers (CdR 1439)
'the pagans have died by thousands'
morir, transitive use ('kill'):

qui tei a mort France douce a honnie (CdR 2953)
'(he) who has killed you has dishonored (our) beloved France'
Reflexive verbs as a rule combine with estre in compound tenses as well, cf:

s'i est cuchet (CdR 2358, this lesson)
'he lay down'
But there are many instances with avoir, as in:

il s'a vestu
'he has put his clothes on'
With other verbs as well, there is some variation or confusion in the use of auxliaries, cf.:

mur ne citet n'i est remés a fraindre (CdR 5, Lesson 1)
'there is no wall or town left to conquer'
en la citet nen ad remés paien (CdR 101, Lesson 1)
'in the town no pagan is left'
10 Impersonal Verbs
Impersonal verbs are verbs that ypically occur in the third person singular, with or without a pronominal element, as in:

anuite 'it is getting dark'
il anuite 'it is getting dark'
Strictly speaking, il in this context is a pronominal element that occupies the place of a pronominal subject, but has no semantic value (it is empty). Most instances of impersonal verbs in Old French do not have this element.

Impersonal verbs are found in all early Indo-European languages and, while many early Indo-European languages had numerous impersonal verbs, their number in most languages decreased with time.

There are three types of impersonal verbs in Indo-European:

impersonal verbs expressing meteorological conditions and events;
impersonal verbs expressing emotions, feelings, and physical experience;
impersonal verbs expressing modality, such as necessity.
These three types are attested in Old French; category 3 verbs increase with time.

10.1 Meteorological conditions and events
(il) anuite 'it is getting dark'
(il) avesprit 'it is getting dark'
(il) ajorne 'the day breaks'
(il) neige 'it is snowing'
(il) plove 'it is raining'
10.2 Emotions, feelings, and physical experience
(il) abelist 'it pleases'
(il) membre 'remember'
(il) remembre 'remember'
10.3 Modality, such as necessity
(il) affiert 'it is fitting'
(il) loist 'it is possible'
(il) estuet 'it is necessary'
(il) semble 'it seems'
(il) fault 'it is necessary'
(il) covient 'it is necessary'
(il) chaut 'it matters, it is important'
In addition to these impersonal verbs, there are also several impersonal expressions in Old French, cf:

estre tart a 'to be eager'
estre avis a 'to be of the opinion'
avoir mestier a 'to be of use to, need'
The person who is undergoing the emotional or physical experience or to whom the modality refers is referred to in the oblique case or a pronominal direct or indirect object:

molt est la reine tart 'the queen is very eager'
m'est avis 'it seems to me'
morir le covient 'he had to die'
ni li chalt (CdR 227) 'it does no matter to him'
The verb avoir has been glossed in this on-line course as meaning 'have, be'. Avoir, first of all, is a verb of possession 'have', but in impersonal constructions its meaning becomes 'be', cf.:

num ad Rollant 'he has the name Roland; he is called Roland'
grifuns i ad 'there are griffins'
The object or person that is present takes the form of an oblique case, as in the preceding example. The constructions are found in Old French with or without il and with or without i, cf:

ad + oblique case 'there is' --
meillor vassal n'aveit en la curt nul (CdR 231) 'there was no better knight at the court'
i + ad + oblique case 'there is' --
bataille i ad (CdR 1791, this lesson) 'there is a battle'
grifuns i ad (CdR 2544) 'there are griffins'
n'i ad cheval (CdR 2522) 'there is no horse'
n'i ad castel (CdR 3, Lesson 1) 'there is no castle'
il + i + ad + oblique case 'there is' --
il nen i ad ne veie ne senter (CdR 2399, this lesson) 'there is no road nor path'
que il n'i ait o Franceis o paien (CdR 2401, this lesson) 'where there is no Frenchman nor pagan"
The use of il in these constructions is rather rare in early times, but spreads in the Middle French period; eventually the expression became fixed, including il as well as i. It survives in Modern French as il y a 'there is'.

Lesson 3
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
Saints played an important role in everyday life in the Middle Ages. A saint is a person who is officially recognized by the Church of Rome as having lived a remarkably holy life. Because of their exceptional Christian virtues, saints are assumed to be in heaven, where they are able to intercede for sinners, those who live a less-than-holy life.

With the calendar of saints indicating the days of the individual saints, the Church had introduced their systematic celebration, highlighting their virtuous lives as Christians. Because of their interceding function, saints often were patrons of certain groups, roles that generally trace back to events in their lives. St. Nicolas, for example, was patron saint of sailors because -- according to legends -- he had saved sailors at one point in his life; St. Luke, who originally was believed to be a painter and a physician, was the patron saint of painters and of physicians. Moreover people generally were named after a saint, for whom they tended to develop special devotion.

Outside and inside churches and houses were many statues of saints, each with its own symbols (e.g. St. John the Evangelist with the poisoned cup to which he was condemned). There was a strong hagiographic tradition as well: an important number of medieval documents describe saints' lives, often written by contemporaries or based on stories told by them.

Saints were, so to speak, omnipresent in daily life in the Middle Ages.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text for this lesson has been taken from La Vie de Saint Alexis, which dates from the mid-11th century and relates the life of Saint Alexis, a young Roman whose life was devoted to God. The legend of St. Alexis is rather international: it is attested in Syria, Greece, and Western Europe. The document discussed here presumably is based on a lengthy written tradition.

The Old French text is a poem of 625 verses, which in all probability was chanted during the liturgy of the saint's day, July 17.

Son of an important and rich Roman senator, Alexis decides on the eve of his wedding to leave Rome and live with the poor. Having distributed his possessions among the poor, he lives for seventeen years in Edessa, spending his days as a beggar. When the locals come to consider him a saint, he leaves the town on a ship and eventually ends up in Ostia, a port close to Rome. In the streets of Rome he encounters his father, who fails to recognize him. Alexis asks to be taken into the household. His father accepts, and Alexis stays there for another seventeen years without being recognized by his family, living as a pauper under the staircase. Refusing to reveal his identity, he sees how his parents and his wife grieve his loss. He patiently undergoes the physical torments he imposes upon himself and the pestering by his father's men. After seventeen years he feels that he is about to die and he calls for his servant: he will write a letter explaining the situation and revealing his indentity. Shortly after his death, the letter is discovered and Alexis is recognized as a saintly figure.

The fragments below describe how Alexis, after seventeen years, returns to Rome and asks his father to take him into his house. They also describe how his parents and his wife fail to recognize him, and spend their time grieving their lost son and husband.

A un des porz ki plus est pres de Rome,
Iloec arivet la nef a cel saint home. Quant vit sun regne, durement s'en redutet
De ses parenz, qued il nel recunuissent
E de l'honur del secle ne l'encumbrent. Eist de la nef e vint andreit a Rome; Vait par les rues dunt il ja bien fut cointe,
Altra pur altre, mais sun pedre i ancuntret, Ansembl'ot lui grant masse de ses humes;
Sil reconut, par sun dreit num le numet. "Eufemïen, bel sire, riches hom,
Quar me herberges pur Deu an ta maison; Suz tun degrét me fai un grabatum
Empur tun filz dunt tu as tel dolur; Tut soi amferm, sim pais pur sue amor". Quant ot li pedre le clamor de sun filz,
Plurent si oil, ne s'en puet astenir: "Por amor Deu e pur mun cher ami,
Tut te durai, boens hom, quanque m'as quis,
Lit ed ostel e pain e carn e vin". Sovent le virent e le pedre e le medra,
E la pulcele quet il out espusede:

Translation
In one of the ports that is closest to Rome,
There the ship of that holy man arrives.
When he saw his country, he is very worried
About his parents, that they recognize him
And overload him with the honors of the world.
He leaves the ship and went directly to Rome;
He goes through the streets with which he was already very familiar,
One after the other, eventually he there runs into his father,
Together with him is a large group of his men;
And he recognized him, he calls him by his proper name.
"Eufemien, dear Lord, powerful man,
may you lodge me in your house for the sake of God;
Make me a simple bed under your staircase
For the sake of your son, about whom you have such grief;
I am utterly weak and thus feed me for his love".
When the father hears the appeal of his son,
His eyes shed tears, he cannot contain himself:
"For the love of God and for my beloved friend,
I will give you, good man, all you have asked me for,
A bed and lodging and bread and meat and wine."
They saw him often, his father and his mother,
And the girl whom he had married:
They never recognized him in any way;
He did not tell them, and they did not ask,
Who he was nor what country he came from.
Many times he sees them display great grief
And shed tears from their eyes with great tenderness,
Entirely for him, never for themselves.
Sir Alexis takes it in resignation;
It does not matter, that much he is turned to God.
Under the staircase where he lies on his matting,
There they feed him of the remains of the table.
In great poverty he lives his high social rank;
He does not want his mother to know:
He loves God more than his entire lineage.
He has tortured his body that way during thirty-four years:
God wants to reward his devotion:
His physical weakness becomes much more painful for him.
He now knows well that he has to die:
He has called his servant to see him.
Grammar
11 Past Tenses: Uses
In the previous lesson it was said that Old French had an imperfect tense (Fr. imparfait, e.g. chantoie 'I was singing'), a preterite (Fr. passe/ simple or passe/ de/fini, e.g. chantai 'I sang'), and a compound past tense, the perfective present (e.g. ai chanté 'I have sung').

The actual uses of these forms will be discussed in the following paragraphs. It is, however, necessary to include in this discussion the present as well, because that tense is often used as a so-called historical present.

The student may have noticed in the fragments analyzed so far that the present and the three past tenses may alternate in any given sentence, as for example:

(a) the present and the preterite:

 	 	Karles l'oït e ses Franceis l'entendent (CdR 1788, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Charles heard (Pret.) him and his subjects hear (Pres.) him'
(b) the compound tense and the preterite:

 	 	Carles li reis, ...,
 	 	Set anz tuz pleins ad estet en Espaigne:
 	 	Tresqu'en la mer cunquist la tere altaigne (CdR 1-3, Lesson 1)
 	 	'Charles the king, ...,
 	 	has been in Spain a full seven years:
 	 	he conquered (Pret.) the high land up to the sea'
The use of tenses was less strict in early medieval texts than it became from the 13th century onward. Yet even in the early period tense use was not chaotic; there were definite tendencies:

(a) imperfect:

refers to past action and state;
refers to actions that are durative or repeted;
refers to habits;
refers to actions that typically are not completed;
in later texts the imperfect may also be used to refer to permanent qualities of persons or objects (see also [b]);
the imperfect in Old French is less frequent than in later times and is often replaced by the preterite.
Examples:

 	 	il nel demanderent
 	 	Quels hom esteit ne de quel terre il eret (Al. 239-240, this lesson)
 	 	'they did (Pret.) not ask him,
 	 	Who he was (Impf.) nor what country he was (Impf.) from'
(b) preterite:

refers to (completed) actions in the past that have no link with the present;
is typically found in reference to a sequence of events;
refers to permanent characteristics of persons or objects (later to be replaced by the imperfect in this use; cf. [a]);
may replace the imperfect.
Examples:

 	 	Blancandrins vint devant Marsiliun (CdR 414)
 	 	'Blancandrin came (Pret.) to see Marsile'
 	 	 
 	 	vairs out les oilz et molt fier lu visage (CdR 283)
 	 	'he had (Pret.) grey-blue eyes and a proud face'
 	 	 
 	 	li quens Rollant fut noble guerrer (CdR 2066)
 	 	'Count Roland was (Pret.) a noble warrior'
(c) compound tense:

refers to action in state of completion;
refers to actions that took place in the past, but have an impact on the present;
refers to action of the past, just like the preterite.
Examples:

 	 	Carles li reis, ... ,
 	 	Set anz tuz pleins ad estet en Espaigne (CdR 1, Lesson 1)
 	 	'Charles the king, ...,
 	 	has been in Spain a full seven years'
 	 	[and now he is on his way back to France]
(d) historical present:

refers to actions that took place in the past as if they are taking place at the moment of narration, enhancing the dramatic effects or liveliness of style;
emotional moments in the text often are in the historical present.
Examples:

In a story set in the past, one finds:

 	 	E Deu apelent andui parfitement (Al. 22)
 	 	'And they both beseeched (Pres.) God perfectly'
Changes in tense use often mark a dramatic moment in the text; cf:

 	 	Quant vit sun regne, durement s'en redutet ... (Al. 198, this lesson)
 	 	'When he saw (Pret.) his country, he was (Pres.) very worried'
 	 	 
 	 	Puis converserent ansemble longament:
 	 	N'ourent amfant, peiset lur en forment, (Al. 21-22)
 	 	'Then they lived (Pret.) together for a long time,
 	 	they had (Pret.) no children, which was (Pres.) a great grief to them'
12 Definite Article: Forms
The definite article in Old French has the following paradigm:

Definite Article

 	 	Masc. Sg.	 	Masc. Pl.	 	Fem. Sg.	 	Fem. Pl.
Nom.	 	li	 	li	 	la	 	les
Obl.	 	le, lo	 	les	 	la	 	les
The vowel of singular forms often disappears in front of another vowel (elision); cf.:

 	 	l'ami	 	'the friend' (Obl. Sg. Masc.)
 	 	l'amie	 	'the friend'(Nom./Obl. Sg. Fem.)
As a rule there is no elision in the nominative singular masculine and in the plural:

 	 	li amis	 	'the friend' (Nom. Sg. Masc.)
 	 	li ami	 	'the friends' (Nom. Pl. Masc.)
In sequences that include a preposition, a definite article, and a noun starting with a consonant, the definite article le and les may combine with the preposition (enclisis); cf:

 	 	a	 	+	 	le	 	>	 	al, au
 	 	a	 	+	 	les	 	>	 	as, aus, aux
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	de	 	+	 	le	 	>	 	del, dou, du
 	 	de	 	+	 	les	 	>	 	des
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	en	 	+	 	le	 	>	 	el, eu, ou, u
 	 	en	 	+	 	les	 	>	 	es
13 Definite Article: Uses
Latin did not have definite articles, but in the shift from Latin to the Romance languages definite articles developed out of Latin demonstratives. For French -- with the exception of a few dialects -- the definite article traces back to the Latin demonstrative ille 'that'.

Whereas the use of definite articles in modern French has become almostautomatic, its use in medieval French is motivated. Because of inconsistencies, linguists so far have not been able to pinpoint the precise "rules," but there are definite tendencies.

The definite article in Old French is used when the element in question is known either because it has already been mentioned, or because it is generally known; cf.:

 	 	Rollant ad mis l'olifan a sa buche (CdR 1753, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Roland has put the horn to his mouth'
In this example reference is made to the horn about which there has been much discussion already. Similarly,

 	 	Li empereres se fait ... balz (CdR 96, Lesson 1)
 	 	'the emperor is ebullient'
The emperor is Charlemagne, who from the beginning of the document is the main character.

In the following example reference is made to la feste seint Martin, which is generally known in the Middle Ages:

 	 	Vos le sivrez a la feste seint Michel (CdR 37)
 	 	'you will follow him on the holiday of St. Michael'
A noun may also refer to a unique phenomenon, e.g. the world:

 	 	Bons fut le secles ... (Al. 1)
 	 	'Good was the world ...'
On the whole there is no definite article when the noun has generic value, as in:

 	 	Fers e acers i deit aveir valor (CdR 1362)
 	 	'it is iron and steel that have value'
There is no definite article when the noun is an abstract noun; cf.:

 	 	el num la virgine ki portat salvetét (Al. 89)
 	 	'in the name of the Virgin, who brought salvation'
 	 	 
 	 	cum fort pecét m'apresset! (Al. 59)
 	 	'how much sin is tempting me!'
There is no article when the noun refers to a country; cf.:

 	 	de dulce France i ad quinze milliers (CdR 109, Lesson 1)
 	 	'from our beloved France there are fifteen thousand men'
Before the 13th century there generally is no article when the noun refers to peoples or groups of people; cf.:

 	 	Franceis i unt ferut de coeur e de vigur;
 	 	Paien sunt morz a millers (CdR 1438-1439)
 	 	'the French have been striking there with zeal and strength;
 	 	the pagans have died by thousands'
There are a number of expressions including a verb and a direct object in which the noun does not combine with an article, such as:

 	 	merci crier	 	'beg for mercy'
 	 	messe esculter	 	'go to mass' (lit.: to mass listen)
 	 	guerre commencer	 	'start war'
 	 	merci aveir	 	'have mercy'
There is no definite article in adverbial expressions introduced by a preposition; cf.:

 	 	a grant poverte deduit sun grant parage (Al. 248, this lesson)
 	 	'in great povery he lives his high social rank'
In an ennumeration a noun may be ommited, leaving the definite article behind; cf.:

 	 	al tens Noë ed al tens Abraham ed al David (Al. 6-7)
 	 	'in the time of Noah and in the time of Abraham and in that of David'
The definite article combines often with titles and proper names; cf.:

 	 	Li reis Marsilie (CdR 10, Lesson 1)
 	 	'King Marsilie'
 	 	 
 	 	Li quens Rollant (CdR 1785, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Count Roland'
Definite articles may combine with possessives; cf.:

 	 	par le men escïentre (CdR 1791, Lesson 2)
 	 	'to my knowledge'
 	 	 
 	 	la tue amurs (CdR 3107)
 	 	'your love'
 	 	 
 	 	la sue anfermetét (Al. 278, this lesson)
 	 	'his physical weakness'
14 The Subjunctive: Forms
Old French is characterized by the productive use of the present and past subjunctive. The formation of the two subjunctives is based on two different stems. The present subjunctive is based on the present stem, which also is found in the first person plural indicative; cf.:

Formation of the Present Subjunctive

 	 	Inf.	 	Pres. Part.	 	1st Pl. Pres.	 	Pres. Subju.
 	 	chanter	 	chantant	 	chantons	 	chant
 	 	fenir	 	fenissant	 	fenissons	 	fenisse
 	 	partir	 	partant	 	partons	 	parte
The imperfect subjunctive is based on the perfective stem, found in the past (perfective) participle and the preterite as well; cf.:

Formation of the Imperfective Subjunctive

 	 	Inf.	 	Past Part.	 	Pret.	 	Impf. Subju.
 	 	chanter	 	chanté	 	chantai	 	chantasse
 	 	fenir	 	feni	 	fenis	 	fenisse
 	 	partir	 	parti	 	parti	 	partisse
From a historical perspective, Old French chantasse traces directly to Latin cantavissem (cantav-issem), and like the preterite is based on the perfective stem of the verb: chantai for example traces back to Latin cantavi (cantav-i). The Old French past (or perfective) participle has the same stem as well, because it is based on the Latin perfective stem. This is especially clear in Latin verbs like relinquere 'leave', which have -n- in its present stem, but not in the perfective stem; cf. relinquo 'I leave' vs. reliqui 'I have left', relinquens 'leave-Pres. Part.' vs. relictus 'leave-Pf. Part.'.

15 The Subjunctive: Uses
The subjunctive is a mood that expresses the speaker's attitude towards the action conveyed by the verb: fear, anger, wish, and so forth. The indicative, by contrast, refers to a plain fact. Compare the following two examples:

 	 	Li reis me done cunseil
 	 	'the king gives me advice'
In this example the speaker makes a simple observation of something that is happening. In the next example the speaker expresses his wish that the event expressed by the verb will take place; cf:

 	 	Que Deus pareîs me duinst
 	 	'(that) God give me access to Heaven'
In Modern French, the use of the subjunctive in main clauses is limited to one or two fixed expressions (e.g. vive la France 'long live France') and to constructions introduced by the particle que 'that', expressing wishes or orders; cf., for example, que personne ne sorte 'nobody should go out'.

In Old French, the use of the subjunctive was more widespread. First, the present as well as imperfect subjunctive were both very much alive. Second, the subjunctive was freely used in subordinate as well as main clauses and its occurrence was semantically motivated.

In main clauses the subjunctive typically expresses wishes and orders, and may or may not be combined with the particle que, si, or car:

 	 	filz, la tue aname el ciel seit absoluthe! (Al. 410)
 	 	'son, may your soul be free in heaven!'
 	 	 
 	 	si m'aît Deus
 	 	'God help me'
 	 	 
 	 	de vos ait Deus mercit! (CdR 1855)
 	 	'may God have pity upon you'
 	 	 
 	 	Deus li otreit seinte beneîçun! (CdR 2245)
 	 	'may God give him his blessing'
 	 	 
 	 	paien, mal aies tu!
 	 	'heathen, be damned (lit.: have [Subju.] misery)!'
 	 	 
 	 	quar me herberges ... an ta maison (Al. 217, this lesson)
 	 	'may you lodge me in your house'
The second person subjunctive could also function as an imperative marked for its politeness (see Grammar Point 16, Lesson 4).

In subordinate clauses, the subjunctive occurs:

· after verbs expressing a wish; cf.:

 	 	il voelt veirement que Carles diet (CdR 2362-2363)
 	 	'he really wants that Charles said ...'
 	 	 
 	 	priet Deu que pareîs li duinst (CdR 2241)
 	 	'he prays to God that He give him access to heaven'
· after verbs expressing the notion of 'thinking', e.g. penser 'think', m'est avis 'it seems to me', cuider 'think', croire 'believe'; cf.:

 	 	ne sai le lieu ... u t'alge querre (Al. 133-134)
 	 	'I do not know the place where to look (Subju.) for you'
· after verbs expressing an order:

 	 	je vos defend que n'i adeist nuls hom (CdR 2437)
 	 	'I order you that no one get (Subju.) close'
· after verbs expressing doubt, possibility, or necessity; cf.:

 	 	se mei leüst, si t'oüsse guardét (Al. 490)
 	 	'if it had been allowed, I would have protected you'
· after verbs expressing fear; cf.:

 	 	durement s'en redutet..., qued il nel recunuissent (Al. 198-199, this lesson)
 	 	'he is very worried that they [might] recognize (Subju.) him'
· in indirect interrogative constructions, especially after a negation:

 	 	ne set qu'il face
 	 	'he does not know what to do (Subju.)'
· after negated or hypothetical clauses; cf.:

 	 	n'i ad castel ki devant lui remaigne (CdR 4, Lesson 1)
 	 	'there is no castle that resists (Subju.) him'
 	 	 
 	 	nuls n'en i at ki n'alget malendus (Al. 554)
 	 	'there is nobody who leaves (Subju.) in bad shape'
· in adverbial clauses expressing time and referring to future events; cf.:

 	 	n'en descendrat ...
 	 	enceis qu'en seient .VII.C. espees traites (CdR 810-811)
 	 	'he will not come down
 	 	before seven hundred swords have been (Subju.) unsheathed'

Lesson 4
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
As noted in the Introduction to Lesson 3, Old French literature includes several works that praise the lives or martyrdom of saints. Although most saints were historical figures, a few were instead the product of popular imagination. One of the latter figures was, in all likelihood, Saint Eulalia, whose martyrdom shows striking similarities with that of St. Agnes, a young Roman martyr.

According to popular belief, St. Eulalia of Mérida (a.k.a. St. Eulalia of Barcelona) was a saint and martyr who died in 304 at the age of twelve under Maximian, ruler under Emperor Diocletian. In 304, Christianity was not yet the official religion of the Roman Empire.

In 878, bones were identified in Barcelona as those of St. Eulalia, which triggered the saint's cult there and in France as well. In Spain, St. Eulalia was one of the most popular saints. In art she typically is represented with the martyr's palm, and often a dove flies out of her mouth. Our text selection will show why she is represented in that way.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text of this lesson, La Cantilène de Sainte Eulalie, is one of the earliest Old French documents. Like the previous document, it has a liturgical background and was in fact a hymn written to praise the Christian virtues of the saint in question. The hymn praises the saint's stamina: her Christian faith and her love of God remain unshaken in the face of material temptations, threats of torture, and ultimately physical suffering. Having survived the flames, she eventually is decapitated and her soul goes straight to heaven. The narrator then invites readers and listeners to pray that St. Eulalia will intercede on their behalf.

For various scholarly reasons it has been assumed that the text dates from 882 and was written in the north of France. There is no consensus among scholars whether this text is a poem or, rather, poetic prose. Earlier Latin texts may have been a source of inspiration for this document. The reader will notice a relatively high incidence of Latin words in this hymn, which counts only 29 lines (e.g. anima, clementia, post, or Christus). The use of cases is more consistent than we have noticed in the texts discussed so far.

The text also has a number of archaisms in word order patterns, cf. the sequence genitive + noun as in li Deo inimi, the sequence direct object + verb as in qu'elle Deo raneiet, or the sequence direct object + infinitive as in volt lo seule lazsier (see also Grammar Point 17). The syntactic structures are more complex than they have been so far: there are several rather complex subordinate constructions involving a subjunctive form of the verb, e.g. elle no'nt eskoltet les ... conselliers qu'elle Deo raneiet or il li enortet, dont lei nonque chielt, qued elle fuiet lo nom..., ell'ent aduret lo ... element.

The nothern origin of the text is illustrated by a certain number of features, for example retention of [k] before [a] as in cose 'thing', but chief 'head' with a palatalized initial consonant.

Qu'elle perdesse sa virginitét.
Por os furet morte a grand honestét. Enz enl fou la getterent, com arde tost.
Elle colpes non auret, por o nos coist.
A czo nos voldret concreidre li rex pagiens;
Ad une spede li roveret tolir lo chief. La domnizelle celle kose non contredist:
Volt lo seule lazsier, si ruovet Krist.
In figure de colomb volat a ciel. Tuit oram que por nos degnet preier
Qued auuisset de nos Christus mercit
Post la mort et a lui nos laist venir
Par souue clementia
Translation
Eulalia was a good girl,
She had a beautiful body and an even more beautiful soul.
The enemies of God wanted to overcome her,
They wanted to make her serve the devil.
She does not listen to the mean men who advise
That she abjure God, who lives right up in heaven.
Not for gold, nor money, nor precious objects,
Not because of royal menaces or begging,
Not one thing could ever make her yield
From continuously loving God's service.
And for this reason she was brought before Maximian,
Who in those days was king over the pagans.
He urges her, but she is never interested,
That she abandon the name of christian
And subsequently worship his god.
She would rather undergo persecution
Than lose her spiritual purity.
For these reasons she died in great honor.
They threw her into the fire so that she would burn quickly.
She had no sins, for this reason she did not burn.
The pagan king did not want to give in to this;
He ordered her head to be cut off with a sword.
The girl did not oppose that idea:
She wants to abandon earthly life, and she calls upon Christ.
In the form of a dove she flew to heaven.
Let us all pray that she will deign to pray for us
That Christ may have mercy on us
And may allow us to come to Him after death
Through His grace.
Grammar
16 Imperative
The imperative is a mood that, in direct address, expresses an order, a request, or a suggestion. The imperative may be negated:

 	 	ne vus esmaiez! (CdR 27) 'do not worry'
 	 	vs. tais, Oliver (CdR 1026) 'be silent, Oliver'
Verbs in Old French have two imperative forms, the second person singular and the second person plural, which are used when one addresses the person or persons with whom one is talking; cf.:

Imperative, 2nd Sg. and 2nd Pl.

Imperative	 	 	 	2nd Sg.	 	2nd Pl.
 	 	Verbs in -er	 	chante	 	chantez
 	 	Verbs in -ir, with infix	 	fenis	 	fenissiez
 	 	 	 	fenissez	 	 
 	 	Verbs in -ir, without infix	 	part	 	partez
 	 	Verbs in -re	 	cor	 	corez
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	estre	 	soies	 	soiiez
 	 	 	 	 	 	soiez
 	 	avoir	 	aie(s)	 	aiiez
 	 	 	 	 	 	aiez
In addition, there is a first person plural imperative, which rather is an adhortative, e.g. chantons 'let us sing'. Its forms are as follows:

Imperative, 1st Pl.

Imperative	 	 	 	1st Pl.
 	 	Verbs in -er	 	chantons
 	 	Verbs in -ir with infix	 	fenissons
 	 	Verbs in -ir without infix	 	partons
 	 	Verbs in -re	 	corons
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	estre	 	soiiens, soions
 	 	avoir	 	aiiens, aions
Verbs with varying stress patterns (e.g. aimer, aim 'I love' [stress on the stem] vs. amons 'we love' [stress on the ending], see Lesson 2), have similar stress patterns for the imperative forms; the singular forms have no ending, the plural forms are identical to those of the present indicative:

Imperative, Verbs with varying stress patterns

Imperative	 	 	 	2nd Sg.	 	1st Pl.	 	2nd Pl.	 	 
 	 	aimer 'love'	 	aim	 	amons	 	amez	 	 
 	 	tenir 'hold'	 	tien	 	tenons	 	tenez	 	 
 	 	dire	 	'say'	 	di	 	dimes	 	dites
 	 	faire	 	'make'	 	fai	 	faimes	 	faites
 	 	croire 'believe'	 	croi	 	creons	 	creez	 	 
 	 	boire	 	'drink'	 	beif	 	bevons	 	bevez
 	 	 	 	boif	 	buvons	 	buvez	 	 
The imperative often combines with the particle car, which functions as a reinforcing element:

 	 	Rollant, l'olifant car sunez (CdR 1059) 'Roland, blow the horn'
 	 	Car chevalchiez, barun! 'Ride, knights!'
In polite expressions the second person subjunctive could have imperative value as well, in main clauses with or without particle, e.g. car, which here again functions as a reinforcing element; cf.:

 	 	quar me herberges ... (Al. 217, Lesson 3) 'may you lodge me' > 'lodge me'
Finally, infinitives could function as imperatives as well, especially in negation; they then have the value of a second person singular imperative; cf.:

 	 	Sire cumpainz, amis, nel dire ja! (CdR 1113)
 	 	'Sir companion, friend, never say that!
In affirmative uses, the infinitive is preceded by de, the definite article, and or in clause-initial position. Often the imperative then refers to the first person plural and has adhortative value; cf.:

 	 	or del mangier 'well let's eat'
 	 	or du ferir 'let's strike!'
17 Word Order
When discussing word order patterns including subjects and direct objects, linguists typically refer to the order of nominal elements; in the ordering of pronominal elements non-syntactic factors (e.g. prosodic factors) play an important role.

The well-established case system in Latin allowed for word order variation. Consequently, for pragmatic reasons or reasons of emphasis, for example, word order in Latin could vary, which however did not mean than Latin word order was indiscriminately "free". There were clearcut tendencies, such as:

· the direct object in unmarked sequence preceded the finite verb; cf.:

 	 	Caesar	 	Gallorum	 	animos	 	verbis	 	confirmavit
 	 	Caesar-Nom.	 	Gauls-Gen.	 	minds-Acc.	 	words-Abl.	 	comfort-Pf.-3Pl.
 	 	'Caesar comforted the minds of the Gauls with his words'
· the genitive as a rule preceded the head noun in unmarked order; cf.:

 	 	Caesaris	 	adventus
 	 	Caesar-Gen.	 	approach
 	 	'Caesar's approach'
· in comparative constructions the ablative of comparison tended to precede the adjective proper; cf.:

 	 	luce	 	clarior
 	 	light-Abl.	 	bright-Comp.
 	 	'brighter than light'
· the subject as topic of the sentence occurred in clause-initial position. As a result the unmarked word order of nominal elements in Latin was Subject + Direct Object + Verb; cf.:

 	 	Ariovistus	 	legatos	 	ad	 	eum	 	mittit
 	 	Ariovistus-Subj.	 	messengers-Dir. Obj.	 	to	 	him	 	send-Pres.
 	 	'Ariovistus sends messengers to him'
In the course of history these Latin ordering patterns, which had been inherited from Proto-Indo-European, were reversed. In Old French, therefore, the direct object follows the finite verb, the genitive follows the noun, and the referent follows the adjective.

· verb + direct object:

 	 	esguardat la pulcela (Al. 56) 'he looked at the girl'
 	 	cunquist la tere altaigne (CdR 2, Lesson 1) 'he conquered the high land'
Similarly, with a predicate:

 	 	Li empereres se fait e balz e liez (CdR 96, Lesson 1)
 	 	'the emperor is ebullient as well as joyful'
· noun + genitive:

 	 	la cambre sum pedre (Al. 74) 'the room of his father'
· adjective + referent:

 	 	mains riches de mon pere (Palefroi 407) 'less rich than my father'
 	 	plus de .IIII. milliers 'more than four thousand'
 	 	chevalier ... plus vieil de lui (Palefroi 658-60) 'a knight older than he'
In general terms it is accurate to say that word order in Old French was well on its way to developing the patterns that are typical of the modern language, but there was more variety and many structures still featured archaic characteristics.

The archaic order object + verb, for example, survived for a long time in subordinate clauses, especially in relative clauses; cf.:

 	 	Marsilie ..., ki Deu nen aimet 'Marsilie ..., who does not love God,'
 	 	Mahumet sert e Apollin recleimet (CdR 7-8, Lesson 1) 'serves Mahomet and invokes Satan'
Similarly the next example with a prepositional phrase:

 	 	n'i ad castel ki devant lui remaigne (CdR 3)
 	 	'there is no castle that resists him'
In other constructions as well one may find archaisms, as in those including an infinitive preceded by its direct object:

 	 	voldrent la faire diaule servir (Eul. 4, this lesson)
 	 	'they want her to serve the devil'
Other sequences are attested as well, but in given contexts. When the subordinate clause is introduced by a relative pronoun in direct object function, the sequence becomes, Complement + Subject + Verb, as in:

 	 	la dame ... que li chevaliers tant aima
 	 	'the lady whom the knight loved that much'
Verb + Subject + Complement typically is attested in interrogative sentences.

A typical construction in Old French is what generally is referred to as subject inversion: when the clause is introduced by a complement, the subject follows the finite verb. Similarly, when the clause is introduced by an adverb or an adverbial construction, the subject commonly follows the finite verb:

 	 	Sur palies blancs siedent cil cevaler (CdR 110, Lesson 1)
 	 	'On white precious clothes the knights are seated'
 	 	ço sent Rollant que ... (CdR 2355)
 	 	'Roland feels that ...'
Similarly, in interjections we frequently find subject inversion:

 	 	Deus! dist li reis, tant me pois esmaier (CdR 2412, Lesson 2)
 	 	'God, the king said, I can torment myself'
18 Demonstratives
Whereas Latin had a demonstrative system based on three elements, French from its earliest times had a system based on two demonstratives; cf.:

Demonstratives, Latin vs. Old French

 	 	Latin	 	Old French
this [close to me]	 	hic	 	cist 'this'
that [close to you]	 	iste	 	 
that [close to him/her]	 	ille	 	cil ' that'
Old French therefore made a distinction between 'this' and 'that'. The forms cist and cil trace back to Latin iste and ille respectively, to which a reinforcing demonstrative element ecce has been added: ecce + istum > cist and ecce + illum > cil.

The inflected forms of the demonstratives in Old French are as follows:

Declension of Demonstratives, cist 'this'

cist 'this'	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. Sg.	 	(i)cist	 	(i)ceste
Obl. Sg.	 	(i)cest	 	(i)ceste
 	 	(i)cet	 	 
Obl. Sg. (stressed)	 	(i)cestui	 	(i)cest(e)i
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	(i)cist	 	(i)cestes, (i)cez, (i)ces
Obl. Pl.	 	(i)cez	 	(i)cestes, (i)cez, (i)ces
 	 	(i)ces	 	 
Declension of Demonstratives, cil ' that'

cil 'that'	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. Sg.	 	(i)cil	 	(i)cele
Obl. Sg.	 	(i)cel	 	(i)cele
Obl. Sg. (stressed)	 	(i)celui	 	(i)cel(e)i
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	(i)cil	 	(i)celes
Obl. Pl.	 	(i)cels	 	(i)celes, (i)ces
 	 	(i)ceus	 	 
The prefix i- is a reinforcing element.

To some extent the original demonstrative distinctions are still present in the early uses in Old French: cist 'here' referred to elements within the range (in time and space) of the speaker and the person spoken to; cil 'that' referred to elements close to a third person.

Cist and cil originally were used both as adjectival and pronominal elements; cf. adjectival uses:

 	 	en cest païs 'in this country'
 	 	en ceste ville 'in this town'
 	 	en celle ville 'in that town'
Pronominal use:

 	 	la u cist furent (CdR 108, Lesson 1)
 	 	'there were these were'
In time, a preference developed by which cist came to be used as an adjectival element, and cil as a pronominal element. Some of the individual forms of the paradigms underwent this change rapidly, others survived much longer. Adjectival cels and celes, for example, relatively soon gave way to cez and ces in that function.

Demonstratives in Old French have deictic function--pointing out elements that are near or further away--and sometimes defining function. In these instances they are similar to definite articles; cf.:

 	 	sur palies blancs siedent cil cevaler (CdR 110, Lesson 1)
 	 	'on white precious clothes the knights are seated'
In order to reinforce the deictic value of demonstratives, speakers started to use the adverbial particles -ci and -la. The particle was attached to the demonstrative or its noun. Instances are attested from the 12th century onward.

The demonstrative paradigms in Old French also included "neuter" forms. These forms were not part of the gender system as such, which was based on the distinction masculine vs. feminine; they refer to elements that are best translated in English as 'it', being elements of indefinite gender; cf.:

Neuter	 	cist	 	cil
Nom. sg.	 	(i)cest	 	(i)cel
Obl. Sg.	 	(i)cest	 	(i)cel
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	-	 	-
Obl. Pl.	 	-	 	-
There also existed an isolated neuter form that traces back to Latin ecce + hoc: ce, with a stressed form ço. Ce, and especially ço, is frequently used in Old French in clause-initial position in combination with verbs such as dire 'say', croire 'believe', sentir 'feel', voir 'see'; the construction is followed by a subordinate clause or by direct speech; cf.:

 	 	Ço dist li reis: "Cel corn ad lunge aleine!" (CdR 1789, Lesson 2)
 	 	'The king spoke these words: "That horn has a long breath!"'
 	 	 
 	 	Ço sent Rollant que la mort le trespent (CdR 2355, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Roland feels that death overcomes him completely'
In addition to compound forms, a non-compound form survived as well in Old French: Latin hoc > Old French o, ou, euc. The form could be used as subject as well as object, often referring to the preceding clause or sentence; cf.:

 	 	E por o fut presentede Maximiien (Eul. 11, this lesson)
 	 	'and for this she was brought before Maximian'
It became obsolete by the end of the 12th century, surviving in a few fixed epression and phrases only.

19 Negation
The most important negating element in Old French is the particle ne, nen. It precedes the (finite) verb, following the inherited pattern from Latin; cf.:

 	 	ne s'en puet astenir (Al. 222, Lesson 3)
 	 	'he cannot contain himself'
 	 	 
 	 	ço ne volt il que sa mere le sacet (Al. 249, Lesson 3)
 	 	'he does not want his mother to know'
The negating element often is reinforced by another element that itself generally has no negating value in origin, cf.:

· nouns (originally) referring to small elements or elements of little value, such as pas 'step', point 'point', goutte 'drop', mie 'crumb', rien '(some)thing', chose 'thing', and many others. Whereas ne tends to precede the finite verb, the nominal element follows; cf.:

 	 	Rollant, ki ne l'otriet mie (CdR 194)
 	 	'Roland, who does not appreciate it'
On the whole this type of negation is slightly stronger than negated clauses with just the element ne. This emphatic value eroded with time and some of the elements grammaticalized and came to be combined with ne to form the most common negating device in later French; cf. il ne mange pas 'he does not eat'.

· adjectives or pronominal elements, such as aucun 'some, someone', or nul 'no one, not any'; cf.:

 	 	niule cose non la pouret omque pleier (Eul. 9, this lesson)
 	 	'not one thing could ever make her yield'
· adverbs such as mais 'more, ever', onques 'ever', ja 'ever', gueres 'much' and others; cf.:

 	 	ne ... onques 'never, not at all'
 	 	ne ... gueres 'not much, not much longer'
 	 	ne ... ja 'never'
 	 	ne ... mais 'no longer, never again'
 	 	 
 	 	unches mais hom tel ne vit ajustee (CdR 1461)
 	 	'never before man saw such a battle'
20 Indefinite Article: Forms and Uses
In addition to definite articles, Romance languages from the earlist times have indefinte articles as well. The paradigm of un (from Latin unus 'one-Nom.' / unum 'one-Acc.) is as follows:

Declension of Indefinite Article

Indef. art.	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. Sg.	 	uns	 	une
Obl. Sg.	 	un	 	une
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	un	 	unes
Obl. Pl.	 	uns	 	unes
The uses of plural un typically have collective value, referring to pairs or to elements that inherently are collective; cf.:

· Pairs:

 	 	uns ganz	 	'a pair of gloves' (Be/r., Tristan 2006)
 	 	Tristan unes forces aveit	 	'Tristan had scissors'
· Collective:

 	 	uns degrez	 	'a staircase'
The occurrence of indefinite articles is rather limited in Old French, as several examples in the texts analyzed so far have shown:

 	 	Ansembl'ot lui grant masse de ses humes (Al. 214, Lesson 3) 'together with him was a large group of men'
 	 	bataille i ad (CdR 1791, Lesson 2) 'there is a battle'
· But:

 	 	ad une spede li roveret tolir lo chief (Al. 22, this lesson)
 	 	'he ordered her head to be cut off with a sword'

Lesson 5
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
From the middle of the 12th century, novels emerged in medieval French literature that put women and love in the limelight. These texts were in a way the forerunners of those that represent l' amour courtois, 'courtly love'. While the hero in the Chanson de Geste primarily was a brave Christian warrior, he now is gallant as well and he fights for his dame rather than for God or his king. In early times the action in these novels was set in antiquity or in the Celtic world (e.g. Cornwall, Ireland, Wales, Armorica). These Celtic novels have strong mysterious and magical characteristics, present passion as fatal, and often focus on the world of King Arthur. The tradition comes to full bloom in the novels of Chrétien de Troyes (Lesson 6). Less refined were the novels of Tristan, which relate the dramatic story -- set in Britanny -- of Tristan and Iseut. The story presumably had its roots in early Celtic legends and made it to France because of contacts with the English.

Tristan was a knight at the court of Marc, king of Cornwall, who also was his uncle and had raised him. Tristan was the son of King Marc's sister and therefore held an important position from an Indo-European anthropological perspective. King Marc was one of the vassals of King Arthur.

Before the actual coup de foudre between Tristan and Iseut takes place, Tristan is sent out on various difficult missions, which he carries out with great success. At some point the king asks him to go to Ireland and bring Iseut, his (Marc's) bride, to his court. On board the ship on their way back to Cornwall, Tristan and Iseut by mistake drink a love potion that the king and Iseut were supposed to drink on the evening of their wedding. As a result Tristan and Iseut are caught in a passionate and overwhelming love that they cannot fight.

There are several texts that relate the story of Tristan and Iseut. Among the best known are the text by Béroul, and a more refined version by Thomas. The texts of both Béroul and Thomas are fragmentary, but Béroul's stories relate the early stages. Thanks to translations in other languages (German, Old Norse, English), we are able to reconstruct the entire story.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text selected for this lesson is a passage from Béroul's Tristan and is dated around 1170 (# 142-175). After the marriage between Marc and Iseut, the affair between Tristan and Iseut continues despite treason, primitive life in a forest, reconciliation with king Marc, Tristan's marriage to another woman, and illness. Eventually Tristan, deceived by his wife, commits suicide, and Iseut dies on top of his body.

In this text Tristan and Iseut are secretly meeting in an orchard; but the king, who has been notified and suspects an illicit relation, is listening in. Tristan and Iseut are aware of his presence but do not show it. Tristan has just asked Iseut to intercede with the king on his behalf.

The text presents an example of spoken medieval French. It includes relatively many personal pronouns and hypothetical se contructions followed by conditionals.

Translation
Sincerely, lord, you make a great mistake,
To talk to me about such matter
That I talk to him about you
And that he forgets his distress.
I do not want yet to die,
Nor perish completely!
He suspects you strongly on my behalf,
And I would have a conversation about it?
Therefore it would be too bold
Sincerely, Tristan, I will not do it,
You should not ask it from me.
I am completely alone in this country.
He has made his private apartment forbidden territory for you
Because of me: if he now hears me talk about it,
He could very well consider me crazy.
Sincerely, I will not to say a word about it;
But I will tell you one thing,
And I want you to know this very well:
If he forgave you, dear lord,
Through God his anger and his distress,
I would be full of joy about it, and happy.
If he now knew about this meeting,
I know well, Tristan, that I would never
have any remedy against death.
I am leaving but I will get no sleep.
I have great fear that some man
Has seen you coming here.
If the king can hear one word
That we have met here,
He would make me burn at the stake.
It would be no great surprise.
My body is trembling, I have great fear.
From the fear, which takes hold of me now,
I am going away, I have been here too long.
Grammar
21 Possession
Possession in Old French noun phrases is expressed primarily by the oblique case, with or without a preposition:

· Without preposition:

 	 	li Deo inimi (Eul. 3, Lesson 4) 'the enemies of God'	 	 
 	 	le rei gunfanuner (CdR 106, Lesson 1) 'the standard bearer of the king'	 	 
 	 	al tens Noë	 	(Al. 6) 'in the time of Noah'
 	 	el ventre la baleine (Elie. 3607) 'in the stomach of the whale'	 	 
· With preposition:

 	 	la nef a cel saint home (Al. 197, Lesson 3)
 	 	'the ship of that holy man'
 	 	 
 	 	filie d'un noble Franc (Al. 40)
 	 	'(the) daughter of a Frankish nobleman'
 	 	 
 	 	fille ad un conpta de Rome (Al. 42)
 	 	'the daughter of a count in Rome'
The distribution of these constructions depends on semantic and syntactic criteria. From a semantic perspective, the construction with de combines with all types of nouns, animate and non-animate. The preposition a / ad only combines with nouns that are animate, whereas the construction without preposition only occurs in combination with nouns that refer to humans or animals that behave like humans (cf. the whale above). The possessor most commonly is referred to by a noun that moreover, as a rule, has no or only a few complements; generally the noun is singular, cf.:

 	 	la fille le rei	 	'the king's daughter'
 	 	les armes vos peres	 	'the arms of your fathers'
 	 	li filz son hoste	 	'the son of his host'
 	 	la feste seint Michel	 	'the holiday of St. Michael'
The various syntactic relations underlying the noun - (preposition) - noun sequences (e.g. subjective vs. objective genitive 'the love of father' vs. 'the love for father') may affect the choice of the construction, but discussion of the details would go too far in the context of this course.

The sequence of elements is most commonly 'element in possession' + 'possessor', cf.:

 	 	la feste seint Michel
 	 	'the holiday of St. Michael'
 	 	la nef a cel saint home (Al. 197, Lesson 3)
 	 	'the ship of that holy man'
 	 	la filie d'un noble Franc (Al. 40)
 	 	'the daughter of a Frankish nobleman'
Yet the reverse order is attested, especially in formulaic expressions (e.g. la Dieu merci), in expressions including autrui (e.g. l'autrui joie 'the joy of another person') and in early texts (e.g. li Deo inimi Eul. 3). With time the sequence 'element in possession' + 'possessor' only spread, with the exception of a few lexicalized items. Among the prepositional expressions there are very few instances in which the possessor comes first.

22 The Future: Forms and Uses
In Lesson 2 it was explained that one of the important changes in the development of the verb system from Latin to Old French was the emergence of 'have' as an auxiliary. The compound past tenses of Old French illustrate this development. Less obvious is the use of the auxiliary 'have' in the forms of the future. These forms trace back to analytic Vulgar and Late Latin formations including an infinitive and a finite form of the verb habeo 'have', cf.:

 	 	Latin	 	 	 	Old French
 	 	cantare habeo 'sing-Inf. have-1st Sg.'	 	>	 	chanterai
With time the analytic Latin forms have become synthetic.

The Old French endings trace back to present tense forms (future) as well as imperfect tense forms (past future and conditional). The paradigms are as follows:

Future, Conjugation

 	 	Future	 	Past Future
1st Sg.	 	chanterai	 	chanteroie
2nd Sg.	 	chanteras	 	chanteroies
3rd Sg.	 	chantera	 	chanteroit
 	 	 	 	 
1st Pl.	 	chanterons	 	chanterïons
 	 	 	 	chanterïons
2nd Pl.	 	chanterez	 	chanterïez
3rd Pl.	 	chanteront	 	chanteroient
The future forms refer to actions that take place in the future. The forms in -roie typically refer to actions that may take place in the future -- likely or unlikely -- and therefore they often occur in hypothetical sentences introduced by se 'if'.

 	 	de soe part vos voldreie preier (Cour. de Louis 516)
 	 	'on his behalf I would like to ask you'
 	 	 
 	 	së il vos pardounot ... j'en seroie joiose
 	 	'if he forgave you ... I would be full of joy' (Be/r., Trist. 160; 162, this lesson)

24 Adjectives: Comparative and Superlative
Adjectives in Old French are marked for case, gender, and number. In addition the adjectival paradigm has analytic comparative forms, although a few adjectives still have synthetic formations.

The most widespread formation is analytic and includes an adverb followed by the adjective proper, cf.:

Comparative, Analytic formation

 	 	Type of comparative	 	Particle	 	Adjective
 	 	comparative of superiority	 	plus 'more'	 	+ adjective
 	 	comparative of inferiority	 	moins 'less'	 	+ adjective
 	 	comparative of equality	 	si 'as'	 	+ adjective
 	 	 	 	aussi 'as'	 	+ adjective
 	 	 	 	tant 'as'	 	+ adjective
 	 	 	 	other adverbs	 	 
Among these forms, the comparative of superiority is by far the most common form.

Yet a few synthetic comparatives from Latin survive in Old French; these are very common, cf.:

Comparative, Synthetic formations

 	 	Adjective	 	Comparative	 	Comparative
 	 	grant 'big, large'	 	graindre (Nom.) /	 	graignor (Obl.)
 	 	 	 	 	 	'bigger, larger'
 	 	grant	 	maire (Nom.) /	 	maior (Obl.)
 	 	 	 	 	 	'bigger, larger'
 	 	petit 'small'	 	mendre (Nom.) /	 	menor (Obl.)
 	 	bon 'good'	 	mieudre (Nom.) /	 	meillor (Obl.)
 	 	mal 'bad'	 	pire (Nom.) /	 	peior (Obl.)
 	 	 	 	 	 	'worse'
The following series of adjectives have a synthetic comparative form only in the oblique case; these forms typically occur in the early texts:

Comparative, Synthetic formations

 	 	Adjective	 	 	 	Comp. Obl.	 	 
 	 	fort	 	'strong'	 	forçor	 	'stronger'
 	 	alt	 	'high'	 	alçor	 	'higher'
 	 	bel	 	'beautiful'	 	belasor (9th c.)	 	'more beautiful'
 	 	 	 	 	 	belior (12th c.)	 	 
 	 	sordois	 	'worse, dirty'	 	sordoior	 	'worse, inferior'
 	 	gent	 	'noble'	 	gençor	 	'more noble'
The declension of the comparative forms follows that of the third class of nouns, cf.:

Synthetic Comparative, Declension (masculine)

Masculine	 	Singular	 	Plural
Nom.	 	graindre	 	graignor
Obl.	 	graignor	 	graignors
Synthetic Comparative, Declension (feminine)

Feminine	 	Singular	 	Plural
Nom.	 	graindre	 	graignors
Obl.	 	graignor	 	graignors
Superlatives generally are not marked, and the interpretation therefore depends on the context, cf.:

 	 	un des porz ki plus est pres de Rome (Al. 197, Lesson 3)
 	 	'one of the ports that is closest to Rome'
Very rarely one may find a superlative that is formally marked: a definite article then combines with the comparative adjective proper (synthetic or analytic). These formations spread in later times, cf.:

 	 	de toutes autres la gençor (Ben.)
 	 	'of all others the most noble'
Yet if there is no analytic formation of superlatives, there are a number of synthetic formations that convey so-called absolute superlative value:

· Several synthetic Latin superlatives have survived in Old French, cf.: pesme 'very bad' (< La. pessimum), merme 'very small'(< minimum), malisme 'very bad', proismes 'very close'(< La. proximum), and others.

· There are learned formations in -isme, cf.:

Superlatives in -isme

 	 	Adjective	 	Superlative	 	 
 	 	fort	 	fortisme	 	'very strong'
 	 	alt	 	altisme	 	'very high'
 	 	grant	 	grandisme	 	'very big'
 	 	saint	 	saintisme	 	'very holy'
· Finally, there is a range of adverbs that convey superlative value in combination with adjectives 'very, most', cf.: molt, tres, mais, tant, mut par and others, e.g.:

 	 	il est mult irascut (CdR 777) 'he is very angry'
 	 	mult grant venjance (CdR 1459) 'a very rude revenge'
25 Adjectives: Comparison
Whereas Latin had two types of comparison, Old French only has an analytic construction. In Latin the comparison was either a case construction or a so-called particle construction.

In the case construction the ablative marks the element that is being compared, cf.:

 	 	luce	 	clarior
 	 	'light-Abl.	 	brighter' > 'brighter than light'
In the particle construction the particle -- quam -- has that function:

 	 	lingua	 	quam	 	manu	 	promptior
 	 	tongue	 	than	 	hand	 	ready-Comp.' >
 	 	'prompter in words than in action'
With the loss of synthetic froms in Latin -- case, comparative, verb forms -- the comparison in Old French has become analytic and includes either a particle or a preposition.

The particle construction (of which the Latin quam construction was a forerunner) is the most widespread type of comparison, cf.:

 	 	plus est isnels que esprever (CdR 1535)
 	 	'he is quicker than a sparrow hawk'
Constructions with a preposition--which trace back to the original case construction in Latin-- typically include a pronominal element or a number, cf.:

 	 	meillor vassal n'out en la curt de lui (CdR 776)
 	 	'there was no better knight in the court than he'
 	 	 
 	 	plus de .IIII. milliers
 	 	'more than four thousand'
The prepositional construction is also attested with a nominal referent when it functions simply as a subject, cf.:

 	 	maines riches de mon pere (Palefroi 407)
 	 	'less rich than my father'
Comparison constructions often include a negation, cf.:

 	 	plus est isnels que n'est oisel ki volet (CdR 1616)
 	 	'he is quicker than a bird that flies'
With time the particle construction spread and came to be used exclusively in comparisons, with the exception of numbers (e.g. modern French il y a plus de vingt étudiants 'there are more than twenty students'). (See Italian for a much more common use of the prepositional construction today).

Lesson 6
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
With the pilgrimages and the crusades, life in Western Europe opened up to new horizons and different lifestyles. As a result the social elite gradually became more secular and developed a keen interest in refined literature, with new ideals and a rich imagination. This development led -- towards the end of the 12th century -- to la littérature courtoise, a literature in which knights with high prestige, following l'idéal courtois, are in constant pursuit of glory and love for their lady. Love in these works is no longer an all-devouring passion, as in the Tristan novels, but rather a pure and noble feeling, which imposes certain rules comparable to those of a feudal society.

Love in these works is based on:

Loyalty and faithfulness;
Mutual admiration: of beauty and wisdom in the lady; of military qualities in the knight. Both need to be polite, elegant, and well-educated (reading, writing, music). They therefore typically represent the higher levels of society;
Veneration of the lady. A source of inspiration, the lady represents a distant love which is almost inaccessible to the knight. The knight carries an object with him that reminds him of her (e.g. glove, curl of hair) and the lady is allowed to ask for rather extreme services, which will prove the knight's love and devotion;
Compensation. When the knight has proven his qualities and his willingness to follow up on her capricious requests, the lady may accept his love, which in fact will take the form of a friendship rather than a passionate love affair.
These ideals are expressed in poetry as well as prose. One of the best known novelists of this period is Chrétien de Troyes, who between 1165 and 1190 wrote several novels that continue the setting of the Celtic novels but combine it with the new ideals: refined love stories involving magic and the world of King Arthur. King Arthur -- reminding the French of Charlemagne -- was popular in France because of his role as the leader of Celtic resistance under the Anglo-Saxons. The novels were based on and related the legends of King Arthur, Lancelot, and the Cycle of the Grail.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text selected for this lesson has been taken from Chrétien de Troyes' novel Yvain ou le chevalier au lion (2560-2580; 2600-2615). Yvain is a knight who discovers a magical fountain in a forest and is attacked by the nobleman who guards it. Having killed his opponent, Yvain hides in the dead man's castle and falls in love with his widow, whom he subsequently marries. Then King Arthur passes by and Yvain decides to escort him on great adventures. He asks his lady to allow him to follow the king in his pursuit of glory. He is granted permission to go away for a year, but he has to be back exactly one year later. When Yvain returns too late, his lady refuses to receive him and Yvain has to carry out a series of new tasks to win back her love.

In the text selected here, Yvain asks his lady to allow him to follow King Arthur and his lady replies, specifying her conditions.

Translation
My very dear lady
You who are my heart and my soul
My good fortune, my joy and my well-being
Grant me one thing
For your honor and for mine.
The lady immediately grants it to him
Although she does not know what he wants to ask
And she says: "Beloved lord, you can
Ask me what you like."
Lord Yvain asks her immediately for permission
to leave to escort the king
And to go fight in tornaments
So that one does not call him a coward.
And she says: "I grant you
Permission to leave for a period of time.
But the love I have for you
will become hatred, be sure of that,
If you exceed the period of time
That I will mention to you;
Know that I will keep my word:
If you fail, I will tell the truth.
If you want to have my love
And you cherish me in any way,
Make sure to come back in time
At the very least within one year
Eight days after the feast of St. John
Of which we celebrate the octave this very day."
Instead of my love you will have sadness and gloom,
If you are not on that day
Back here with me."
But now you should put on your finger
This ring of mine, that I lend to you;
And about the stone that it carries
I want to tell you most openly:
No true and loyal lover
Undergoes captivity, or loses blood,
And no evil can happen to him;
But he who wears it, and cherishes it
Remembers his friend,
And thus he becomes stronger than iron;
This will be your shield and hauberk
And truly never before I wanted
To lend it or give it to a knight,
But because of my feelings of love I give it to you.
Now Lord Yvain has permission to leave:
He shed many tears when taking his leave.
Grammar
26 Adverbs of Manner
Most adverbs in Latin were either fossilized case forms or morphologically marked. Magis 'more', plus 'more' and nimis 'too much', for example, were fossilized accusative neuters. Among adverbs of manner the most productive formation was based on a process of derivation whereby a suffix -e or -(i)ter was added to an adjectival base: -e was used for adjectives of Declension I/II and -(i)ter for adjectives of Declension III, cf.:

Latin Adverb Formation, Adverbs of manner

 	 	Adjective	 	Adverb
 	 	stult-us 'stupid'	 	stult-e 'stupidly'
 	 	grand-is 'great'	 	grand-iter 'greatly'
In the later periods of Latin and in its popular varieties the -(i)ter derivation spread at the expense of -e, cf.:

 	 	avidus 'eager'	 	(avide)	 	>	 	aviditer
 	 	benignus 'benign'	 	(benigne)	 	>	 	benigniter
Moreover two new strategies developed, prepositional phrases and adjective + noun combinations:

· prepositional phrases

 	 	in commune	 	'generally'
 	 	in totum	 	'entirely'
· adjective + noun combinations

 	 	libero ore	 	'with a frank mouth, frankly'
 	 	citato pede	 	'with a speedy foot, quickly'
 	 	ardenti corde	 	'with a burning heart, ardently, intensely'
 	 	studioso animo	 	'with an eager mind, impatiently'
 	 	tristi mente	 	'with a sad mind, sadly'
Among these varieties the mente combinations survived in the Romance languages, with the exception of Rumanian.

In Old French we find several devices to form adverbs of manner:

26.1. Several adjectives are used as adverbs without any specific morphological marker:

 	 	bel	 	'beautiful, beautifully'
 	 	chier	 	'dear, expensive, dearly'
 	 	cler	 	'clear, clearly'
 	 	droit	 	'right, rightly'
 	 	haut	 	'high, loudly'
 	 	petit	 	'small, slightly'
 	 	tot	 	'all, completely'
 	 	voir	 	'real, sincere, really'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	escriet e haltement e cler (CdR 1974)
 	 	'he shouted loudly and clearly'
When adjectives are used as adverbs, they can still show agreement with the noun: this pattern is typical of tot, cf.:

 	 	tote sui sole en ceste terre (Bér., Trist. 153, Lesson 5)
 	 	I am completely alone in this country'
 	 	 
 	 	A l'apostolie revint tuz esmeriz (Al. 352)
 	 	'he turned toward the pope completely shaken'
26.2. A suffix -tre(s), which traces back to the -(i)ter suffix of Vulgar and Late Latin is added to a base. In Old French the suffix combines with adjectives as well as nouns, cf.:

 	 	nuitantre 'during the night, at night' < nuit 'night'
26.3. A device that survived as an almost "pan-Romance" phenomenon is the adverbial formation in -ment mentioned earlier. It traces back to the formations mentioned above:

 	 	Adjective + mente	 	'with a ... mind, in ... spirit'
Since mente originally was a feminine noun, the adjective in the French formation takes the feminine form as well:

 	 	Adjective	 	>	 	Adverb
 	 	veir 'real'	 	 	 	veirement 'really'(CdR 2361)
 	 	dur 'hard'	 	 	 	durement 'bitterly' (CdR 1814)
 	 	gent 'noble'	 	 	 	gentement 'bravely'(CdR 2099)
 	 	lung 'long'	 	 	 	lungement 'for a long time' (CdR 1858)
 	 	isnel 'quick'	 	 	 	isnelement 'quickly' (CdR 2085)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ki durement ne plurt (CdR 1814)	 	 
 	 	'who does not cry bitterly'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	si lungement ... m'avez servit (CdR 1858)	 	 
 	 	'you have served me such a long time'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	vengent el camp cumunement	 	(CdR 1838)
 	 	'they arrive at the battlefield together'
Some adjectives have both the -ment formation and may be used as an adverb without morphological change:

 	 	Adjective	 	Adverb	 	Adverb in -ment
 	 	halt	 	halt	 	haltement 'loudly'
 	 	veir	 	veir	 	veirement
In Old French the formation may also include nouns and adverbs as its base:

 	 	altresi	 	adv. 'same'	 	> altresiment 'same'
 	 	vassal	 	n. 'vassal'	 	> vassalment 'bravely'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Franceis sunt bon, si ferunt vassalment (CdR 1080)
 	 	'the French are brave, they will fight bravely'
The derivation on the basis of Class I/II adjectives is not problematic because the formation of the feminine is provided in the paradigm (e.g. dur masc. > dure fem. > durement adv.). Class III adjectives do not include a feminine form in -e but instead all adjectives end in a consonant (cf. Grammar Point 4): e.g. fort 'strong'. Derivation with these adjectives as base therefore results in a number of phonetic assimilations, cf.:

· consonant assimilation

 	 	fort + -ment	 	>	 	forment
 	 	grief + -ment	 	>	 	griément
· -l- vocalization

 	 	cruel + -ment	 	>	 	cruaument
· loss of -l-

 	 	gentil + ment	 	>	 	gentiment
26.4. A suffix -s may be added to adverbs, prepositions, and nouns to form a new adverb:

 	 	merveille	 	>	 	merveilles
 	 	'remarkable thing'	 	 	 	'marvelously, extremely'
This process is possibly based on analogy with the high number of Latin adverbs in -s that survived in Old French and were very widespread: e.g. mais 'more' < La. magis, plus 'more' < La. plus, fors 'except' < La. foris. The process accounts for the etymology of several formations as well:

 	 	unques / unces	 	<	 	La. umque + -s 'ever'
 	 	sempres	 	<	 	La. semper + -s 'always'
 	 	sens, sans	 	<	 	La. sine + -s 'without'
26.5. Adverbial formations based on prepositional phrases survive in Old French, cf.:

 	 	par grant irur (CdR 1842)	 	'with great anger'
 	 	par / a compas	 	'regularly'
 	 	par maistrie	 	'excellently'
The formation is especially productive when including the preposition a + a plural noun in -on, cf.:

 	 	a tastons 'gropingly'
 	 	a genouillons 'on one's knees'
27 Personal Pronouns: Forms
Since pronouns are elements that are used instead of a noun they agree in number, case, and gender with the noun they replace. The paradigms of personal pronouns in Old French distinguish person (1-3), number (singular/plural), gender (for the third person), and case (nominative, direct object, indirect object). Moreover there is an important distinction between so-called stressed and unstressed non-nominative forms. The paradigms are as follows:

Personal Pronouns

 	 	1st Sg.	 	2nd Sg.	 	3rd Sg.	 	3rd Sg.
 	 	 	 	 	 	Masc.	 	Fem.

Indir. Obj.	 	nos	 	vos	 	lor	 	lor
 	 	 	 	 	 	leur	 	leur
Indir. Obj. (str.)	 	-	 	-	 	-	 	-
Elision and enclisis

Like the definite article (see Grammar Point 14), personal pronouns may undergo processes of elision and enclisis:

Elision:

· unstressed elements easily undergo elision, especially le and la:

 	 	l'oïrent (CdR 1756) 'they heard it'
 	 	pur ço l'ad fait (CdR 2361)
 	 	'for this reason he has done this'
· je, which is inherently stressed, does not undergo elision;

· strong forms, such as moi and toi, followed by en or i may undergo elision.

Enclisis:

The unstressed forms of the paradigm may be attached to other elements in the clause, especially je, ne, se, si, que, en:

Personal Pronouns, Patterns of enclisis

 	 	je + le	 	>	 	jel, gel
 	 	je + les	 	>	 	ges
 	 	ne + le	 	>	 	nel, nu, nul
 	 	ne + les	 	>	 	nes
 	 	que + le	 	>	 	qel
 	 	qui + le	 	>	 	quil
 	 	qui + les	 	>	 	quis
 	 	se + le	 	>	 	sel
 	 	se + les	 	>	 	ses
 	 	si + le	 	>	 	sil, sel
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	s'est kil demandet (CdR 119, Lesson 1)
 	 	'if there is someone who asks for him'
 	 	 
 	 	e li message descendirent a pied
 	 	sil saluerent ... (CdR 121, Lesson 1)
 	 	'and the messagers came down'
 	 	'and they greeted him ...'
28 Personal Pronouns: Uses
28.1. In Old French tu was a second person singular pronoun, whereas vos was a true plural, used only to address more than one person. Soon a polite use of vos developed as well when it came to be used--inconsistenly at first--to address a person of higher social rank. Among nobles, for example, vos became part of basic politeness. Yet, God typically continued to be referred to in direct address as tu.

28.2. Subject pronouns are late in Indo-European. The finite verb expressed person and number, and early uses of subject pronouns were marked, having emphatic function. In Old French as well, subject pronouns are not obligatory. Accordingly the finite verb in Old French as a rule may occur without explicit subject, be it nominal or pronominal:

 	 	Rollant ad mis l'olifan a sa buche
 	 	Empeint le ben, par grant vertut le sunet
 	 	(CdR 1753-1754, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Roland has put the horn at his mouth'
 	 	'(he) places it solidly and (he) blows with great force'
 	 	 
 	 	L'olifan sunet a dulor e a peine (CdR 1787, Lesson 2)
 	 	'(He) blows the horn in suffering'
The explicit subject can be absent even when there is a change of subject, cf.:

 	 	que de vos mete a raison
 	 	et de s'ire face pardon (Bér., Trist. 165-166, Lesson 5)
 	 	'that I talk to him about you'
 	 	'and that he forgets his distress!'
The absence of subject pronouns traditionally has been accounted for by the rather explicit verb ending. The texts analyzed so far show that in some the use of pronominal subjects is more frequent than elsewhere. The Chanson de Rolland has relatively few subject pronouns, and when they occur their use is emphatic. The text of Lesson 5, a passionate dialogue in which persons take position, has relatively many instances. The use of subject pronouns in Old French therefore often marks a certain emphasis, cf. the following example, where the use of the subject pronouns is contrastive:

 	 	pur mei n'iras tu mie! (CdR 296)
 	 	'you will not go in my place !'
 	 	 
 	 	Qui i purruns enveier ... ?
 	 	Jo i puis aler mult ben! (CdR 252; 254)
 	 	'whom could we send there?'
 	 	'I could go there easily !'
The following example illustrates emphatic use of the subject pronoun in combination with left dislocation:

 	 	li quens Rollant, il est mult irascut (CdR 777)
 	 	'count Roland, he is very angry'
As a result the subject pronoun is inherently stressed and therefore can occur at various locations in the clause, not only in proximity to the verb: cf.:

 	 	il et ses freres ...	 	'he and his brothers ...'
 	 	je et mi chevalier ...	 	'I and my knights ...'
Instead of subject pronouns Old French may use nouns such as cors 'body', cf.:

 	 	mis cors trenble (Trist. 173, Lesson 5)
 	 	'my body is trembling' > 'I am trembling'
Cors can also be used as a reinforcing element especially when it combines with a personal pronoun, cf.:

 	 	 	 	Jo cunduirai mun cors en Rencesvals (CdR 892)
 	 	 	 	'I myself will go to Roncedvaux'
 	 	vs.	 	 
 	 	 	 	En Rencesvals irai mun cors juer ! (CdR 901)
 	 	 	 	'I will go to Roncevaux'
With time the use of subject pronouns increased. One of the important differences between Old and Middle French is the dramatic increase in use of subject pronouns. It is important to point out that subject pronouns in Old French are said to be "deleted" when in postposition to the verb: there are many more instances of preverbal than postverbal pronominal subjects. It may be, however, that the spread of subject pronouns as pointed out manifested itself preverbally first, and postverbally only later.

The use of subject pronouns with impersonal verbs is late. If subject pronouns are commonly used with finite verbs in Middle French, there is no regular use of pronominal subjects with impersonal verbs before 16th century French. E.g:

 	 	anuite 'it gets dark'
 	 	bataille i ad (CdR 1971, Lesson 2) 'there is a battle'
 	 	m'est avis 'it seems to me'
 	 	tei cuvenist helme ... a porter (Al. 411) 'you need to wear a helmet'
Early instances of impersonal "subject" pronouns are attested, cf.:

 	 	Il nus i cuvent guarde (CdR 192)
 	 	'we need to be careful'
28.3. Unstressed pronominal forms are verb bound: they are in proximity to the verb, either preceding or following it. Stressed forms are characterized by a much less strict use. They typically occur at the beginning of the clause, function as objects of prepositions, combine with infinitives, and are used with emphasis:

With an infinitive:

 	 	as tables juent pur els esbaneier (CdR 111, Lesson 1)
 	 	'they play games to amuse themselves'
With a preposition:

 	 	desuz lui met s'espee (CdR 2359, Lesson 2)
 	 	'under him he places his sword'
 	 	 
 	 	a lui nos laist venir (Eul. 28, Lesson 4)
 	 	'may he allow to come to him'
28.4. Third person direct object pronouns may be omitted in Old French when co-occurring with an indirect object in the same clause, cf.:

 	 	il la volt prendra: cil ne li volt querpir (Al. 351)
 	 	'he wants to take it: Alexis does not want to give (it) to him'
It can also be omitted when the direct object is governed by different verbs; in these instances it will be omitted with the second verb.

29 Possessives: Forms
There are two series of possessives in Old French: stressed, and unstressed. The unstressed possessives are used only as adjectival elements; the stressed forms may be used both as pronominal and adjectival elements. As adjectival elements, possessives agree with the head noun in case, number, and gender. As pronominal elements they agree with the noun they replace.

The feminine forms ma, ta, and sa regularly undergo elision when preceding a vowel-initial noun, cf.:

 	 	s'ire (Bér., Trist. 145, Lesson 5) 'his distress'
 	 	s'amie (Yv. 2610, this lesson) 'his friend'
The stressed possessives trace back to La. meum, tuum, and suum. While meum gave mien, the Old French tuen and suen from the 13th century became tien and sien, in analogy with mien.

With the replacement of tu- and su- by ti- and si- respectively, in analogy with mien (13th century), the declensional pattern of mien spread as well:

Obl. Pl.	 	miennes	 	tiennes	 	siennes
30 Possessives: Uses
Unstressed possessives are used only as adjectival elements. The stressed form, when used as an adjective, as a rule combines with a definite article, a demonstrative, or an indefinite article as well, cf.:

 	 	la meie mort (CdR 2198)	 	'my death'
 	 	la sue mort (CdR 2232)	 	'his death'
 	 	par le men esciëntre (CdR 1791)	 	'to my knowledge'
 	 	i metrai un mien filz (CdR 149)	 	'I will put a son of mine there'
 	 	cest mien anel (Yv. 2603, this lesson)	 	'this ring of mine'
The stressed possessive, when used as a pronoun, generally combines with a definite article, cf.:

 	 	Sainz Alexis la sue ... alascet (Al. 372)
 	 	'St. Alexis let his (hand) go'
 	 	 
 	 	ne n'ai tel gent ki la sue derumpet (CdR 19)
 	 	'I do not have the troops capable of destroying his (army)'
Many instances in Old French include a preposition + personal pronoun instead of a possessive, cf.:

 	 	l'ame de mei 'my soul'
 	 	l'ame de lui 'his soul'

Lesson 7
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
During the heyday of the littérature courtoise, two important historical documents were written about the Fourth Crusade (1202-1204). While the littérature courtoise presents a world of courtly ideals and magic events, the historians in their work present the real world, with its base passions.

Although Crusades primarily had an ideological motivation -- liberating the places of pilgrimage and safeguarding pilgims -- political, personal, and socio-economical reasons soon became important as well. During the Fourth Crusade the original aim, the liberation of Jerusalem, was completely forgotten when political profit and personal greed came to prevail.

The expedition was used by the doge of Venice to reinforce his political power. It established the political hegemony of Venice over the Mediterranean, and ensured its important commercial privileges. The abuse of power of the doge was based on the primordial role Venice played in the transportation of troops. The Crusade never made it beyond Constantinople, which was sacked; there one of the Crusaders, Baudoin of Flanders, was made emperor of the Latin Empire. The Empire would last until 1261.

Two participants in the Fourth Crusade have left lengthy reports about the events: one is written by a poor knight from Picardie, Robert de Clari, who was a simple warrior. The title of his work is L'histoire de ceux qui conquirent Constantinople.

The other source is the Histoire de la conquête de Constantinople, written between 1207 and 1213 by one of the leaders of the Crusade, Geoffroi de Villehardouin, who originally came from Champagne. Villehardouin relates the historical events in a sober style, but his report may not be completely impartial.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The reading for this lesson has been taken from Villehardouin's Histoire de la conquête de Constantinople, sections 345 and 346. In it, reference is made to the Greek as enemy. Having conquered Constantinople, the Crusaders took over Christian property in the area as well, because the Greek population and church were not part of the Church of Rome.

The reader will notice Villehardouin's sober style, with its simplicity and lack of artificial effects. Because of its plainness, many assume that Villehardouin's language was rather close to the spoken language of the day.

As an important representative of the medieval aristocracy, Villehardouin in his text expresses many ideals of his class, the most important of which are loyalty and faithfulness (in relation to God, promises made, and so forth) and braveness. Consequently he rejects any form of cowardice, as he does in the text selected here.

The text has an example of a vigesimal numeral: a numeral based on counting in twenties, rather than in tens. The element in question is the number VI with XX in superscript, meaning six times twenty, six-vingts 'one hundred and twenty'. Vigesimals appeared in the various Indo-European languages in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. Whereas the (inherited) counting system was decimal in early Old French (e.g. huitante 'eighty'), vigesimal numbers emerged and spread starting in the 12th century. In the 16th and 17th centuries their number decreased, and modern quatre-vingts and soixante-dix (a so-called semi-vigesimal) are residues of a phenomenon that was widespread in Old and Middle French (see References in Lesson 10).

bien .IX. jornees loing de Costantinople,
et avoit bien .VIXX. chevaliers avec lui,
que Reniers ses fils le guerpi, et Giles ses freres,
et Jakes de Bondine, qui ere ses niers,

Translation
The book relates a great remarkable event:
the fact that Renier de Trit, who was at Finepople,
at least a nine-days journey away from Constantinople,
had at least one hundred and twenty knights with him,
and the fact that Reniers, his son, abandoned him with Giles, his brother,
and Jake de Bondine, who was his nephew,
and Achar de Vercli, who was married to his daughter.
And they took away from him at least thirty of his knights,
and they thought of going to Constantinople,
and they had abandoned him in such great danger, as you well understand.
And they found the country in revolt against them,
and they were defeated, and thus the Greek took them prisoner,
who subsequently handed them over to the king of Blaquie,
who afterwards ordered their heads to be cut off.
And you should know that they were very little mourned by the people,
because they had been misbehaving that much towards the one
to whom they should not have behaved that way.
And when the other knights of Renier de Trit saw that,
those who were not that close to him,
as people who were less afraid of shame,
they abandoned him, at least eighty knights all together,
and they went away via another road.
And Renier de Trit stayed among the Greek with few people:
because he did not have more than fifteen knights at Phynepople and at Stanemac,
which was a very strong castle that he held,
and where he subsequently was besieged for a long time.
Grammar
31 Interrogatives: Forms and Uses
Questions in Old French can be marked by intonation, cf.:

 	 	il vos mescroit de moi forment
 	 	et j'en tendrait le parlement?
 	 	(Bér., Trist. 169-170, Lesson 5)
 	 	'he suspects you strongly because of me and I would talk about it?'
Inversion is also found, cf.:

 	 	Sire cumpain, faites le vos de gred?' (CdR 2000)
 	 	'Sir companion, do you do this of free will?
In addition a series of interrogative elements are used. The Old French interrogative pronoun qui, ki traces back to Latin quis 'who' (fem. quae, and neuter quod). The paradigm in Old French is as follows:

Interrogative Pronoun, qui 'who?', que 'what?', 'which?'

 	 	Masc/Fem.	 	Neuter
Nom. Sg/Pl.	 	qui, ki	 	que, ke
Nom. Sg/Pl. (str.)	 	 	 	quoi, coi
Dir. Obj. Sg/Pl.	 	que, ke	 	que, ke
Dir. Obj. Sg/Pl. (str.)	 	cui	 	quoi, quei
Indir. Obj.	 	cui	 	 
Examples:

· qui nominative masculine and feminine:

 	 	E ki serat devant mei en l'ansguarde? (CdR 748)
 	 	'and who will be in front of me in the vanguard?'
· que direct object animate and neuter nominative and direct object, cf.:

 	 	que fereient il el? (CdR 1185)
 	 	'what would else would they do?'
· cui functions as a strong direct object (e.g. with a preposition) and as indirect object, cf.:

 	 	de ço qui calt? (CdR 1806)
 	 	'to whom is it of importance?'
This example also shows that qui and cui often are confused.

As the strong form of the neuter interrogative, quoi may be used in isolation (quoi? 'what?'), but it typically combines with prepositions, cf.:

 	 	Pur quei me portez ire? (CdR 1723)
 	 	'why are you angry with me?'
 	 	 
 	 	de quei avez pesance? (CdR 832)
 	 	'what hurts you?'
In addition, Old French has an interrogative element quant meaning 'how much, how many':

Declension of quant 'how much', 'how many'

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
Nom. sg.	 	quanz	 	quante	 	quant
Obl. sg.	 	quant	 	quante	 	quant
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. pl.	 	quant	 	quantes	 	-
Obl. pl.	 	quanz	 	quantes	 	-
And an element quel 'which, what', which has the following paradigm:

Declension of quel 'which', 'what'

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
Nom. sg.	 	quels	 	quel(s)	 	quel
Obl. sg.	 	quel	 	quel	 	quel
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. pl.	 	quel	 	quels	 	-
Obl. pl.	 	quels	 	quels	 	-
NB: -l- may vocalize before -s, which will give: queus

Examples:

 	 	Par quele gent quiet il espleiter tant? (CdR 395)
 	 	'for what people is he pretending to accomplish such things?'
 	 	 
 	 	En quel mesure en purrai estre fiz? (CdR 146)
 	 	'in what circumstances can I trust it?'
The reader will have noticed that interrogative elements tend to occur in clause-initial position and therefore trigger subject inversion when they do not convey subject function, cf.:

 	 	que fereient il el? (CdR 1185)
 	 	'what would else would they do?'
· with an interrogative adverb, cf.:

 	 	U estes vos, bels niés (CdR 2403, Lesson 2)
 	 	'where are you, beloved cousin?'
 	 	 
 	 	U est vostre espee? (CdR 1363)
 	 	'where is your sword?'
 	 	 
 	 	cum le purrum nus faire? (CdR 1698)
 	 	'how should we do it?'
32 Relative Pronouns: Forms and Uses
The paradigm for the relative pronoun is almost identical to that of interrogatives, cf.:

Relative Pronoun, qui 'who', que 'that, which'

 	 	Masc/Fem.	 	Neuter
Nom. Sg/Pl.	 	qui, ki	 	que, ke
Nom. Sg/Pl. (str.)	 	 	 	quoi, coi
Dir. Obj. Sg/Pl.	 	que	 	que, ke
Dir. Obj. Sg/Pl. (str.)	 	cui	 	quoi, quei
Indir. Obj.	 	cui	 	 
Other elements that are used in relative clauses are:

· dont, originally an adverb of place and often used as an interrogative or relative, meaning 'from where, whence'. It may also refer to animate nouns, 'of whose'.

· lequel 'which', which spread from the 13th century onwards.

· ou, originally a relative and interrogative. It refers to animate and inanimate nouns, meaning 'where, in which, in whom'.

32.1. Function of qui as impersonal. On the whole the uses of the relative pronoun correspond to the regular functions of the cases. Yet there are a few important phenomena. One of them is the use of subject qui conveying generalizing value, often tending toward 'if one ...', 'whoever'. Cf.:

 	 	Ki l'unt oïd remainent en grant dute (Al. 300)
 	 	'those who heard it remain very frightened'
Many proverbs in Old French include a generalizing qui:

 	 	qui tout tient tout pert
 	 	'who keeps it all to himself, will lose it all' >
 	 	'if one keeps it all to one's self, one will lose it all'
32.2. Cui is used in Old French primarily as indirect object, but is also found in the function of a direct object, a genitive, or a prepositional complement.

32.3. Regular use of relative pronouns includes the occurrence of an antecedent, cf.:

 	 	N'i ad castel ki devant lui remaigne (CdR 4, Lesson 1)
 	 	'there is no castle that resists him'
The physical distance between the antecendent and the relative pronoun may be rather lengthy:

 	 	Li reis Marsilie la tient, ki Deu nen aimet (CdR 7, Lesson 1)
 	 	'Marsilie holds it, who does not love God'
The antecedent ce is often deleted, cf.:

 	 	ne sai jo que face (CdR 1982)
 	 	'I do not know what to do'
32.4. Deletion of relative pronoun. The relative pronoun is quite often deleted after a negation, cf.:

 	 	Ja mais n'ert hume plus volenters le serve (CdR 2254)
 	 	'there will never be a man who will serve him more readily'
33 On
While Latin nouns that survived in Old French originally were accusatives, a few nominatives made it into (Old) French as well, cf. the difference between modern sire and seigneur, which trace back to the nominative and accusative respectively. Similarly two forms of the Latin noun homo survive, one goes back to the nominative, one is the former accusative, cf. La. homo, which survives as on 'one', and La. hominem which survives as modern French homme 'man'. We therefore observe that in the history of Old French the nominative form homo survived and grammaticalized into a pronoun; the accusative form survived as a regular noun and did not undergo a process of grammaticalization.

Grammaticalization is a type of change whereby a lexical element develops into a grammatical element: in this instance the noun homo developed into a pronominal element in French. Similarly the Latin noun mente developed into a derivational suffix in adverb formation in Romance (see Grammar Point 26). It is also possible that a grammatical element develops a stronger grammatical profile. This happened when Latin demonstratives -- with deictic value -- developed into definite articles (see Grammar Point 13).

The fact that Old French (l')on is a grammaticalized personal pronoun does not mean that the original element no longer is used as noun. The noun in question had the following declension pattern:

Declension of (l')ome

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl.
Nom.	 	(l') (h)om,	 	(li) (h)ome
 	 	(l ) on	 	 
 	 	(l') uem	 	 
Obl.	 	(l') (h)ome	 	(les) (h)omes
 	 	 	 	 
Nominative singular forms, with or without definite article, occur with the generalizing meaning of 'one' from early texts onward, cf.:

 	 	iluec paist l'um del relef de la tabla (Al. 247, Lesson 3)
 	 	'there they feed him on the scraps of dinner'
 	 	 
 	 	que l'an ne l'apialt recreant (Yv. 2563, Lesson 6)
 	 	'so that one will not call him a coward'
The nominal origin of the element is reflected in the occurrence of the definite article. Since the element refers to an undetermined person or undetermined persons, on may be rendered by in translations by 'one', general 'they', or passive constructions.

In the glosses instances of (l')on have been identified as third person personal pronouns because the grammaticalization process has reached that stage in Old French.

34 Agreement
In Old French we find several processes of agreement:

· Agreement between subject and finite verb. When there are several subjects in a clause, the verb agrees with the subject that is closest, cf.:

 	 	Karles l'oït e ses cumpaignes tutes (CdR 1757, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Charles hears it and all his troops' >
 	 	'Charles and all his troops hear it'
For collective subjects there is variation: sometimes the finite verb is singular sometimes it is plural:

 	 	Quan Rollant voit la ... gent,
 	 	ki plus sunt neirs que ... (CdR 1933-1934)
 	 	'when Rollant sees the ... people who are more black then ...'
· Agreement between noun and adjective. The patterns in Old French are not different from those in Indo-European. A remarkable phenomenon is the declension of adjectives that are used as adverbs (see Grammar Point 26), but continue to be marked for agreement, cf.:

 	 	tote sui sole en ceste terre (Bér., Trist. 153, Lesson 5)
 	 	'I am completely alone in this country'
· Agreement between nouns and their determiners: there is agreement marking for case, number, and gender, cf.:

 	 	cest mien anel (Yv. 2603)
 	 	'this ring of mine'
· Agreement between noun and perfective participle. Agreement patterns depend on the auxiliary used in these contexts. A perfective participle that combines with the auxiliary estre 'be' will agree in case, number and gender with the subject of the clause, cf.:

 	 	fut presentede Maximiien (Eul. 11, Lesson 4)
 	 	'she was brought before Maximian'
 	 	 
 	 	morz est Rollant (CdR 2397, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Roland has died'
When the perfective participle combines with the auxiliary avoir 'have', it may agree in case, number and gender with the direct object, independently of its relative position to the participle, cf.:

 	 	ço dist li reis que sa guere out finee (CdR 705)
 	 	'the king says that he had finished his war'
 	 	 
 	 	Rollant ad l'enseigne fermee (CdR 707)
 	 	'Roland has attached the standard'
 	 	 
 	 	Cordres ad prise e les murs peceiez (CdR 97, Lesson 1)
 	 	'he has taken Cordres and smashed its walls'
 	 	 
 	 	proïe avez la duchesse
 	 	'you have robbed the duchess'
When the direct object is masculine, agreement is especially manifest when the participle follows, cf.:

 	 	Charles li magnes ad Espaigne guastede
 	 	les castels pris, les citez violees (CdR 703-704)
 	 	'Charlemagne has devastated Spain,
 	 	taken castles and violated towns'
Conversely when the direct object -- masculine or feminine -- follows the participle, there may be no agreement:

 	 	j'ai creü vostre parole
 	 	'I believed what you said'
The perfective participle may also agree with the direct object of an infinitive or with a direct object that is not explicit in the clause. Neuter elements (pronouns) do not feature agreement. Along these same lines, there is no agreement in compound tenses including impersonal verbs.

35 Brace Constructions
In a so-called brace construction, the finite verb and the perfective participle are separated by the direct object, cf.:

 	 	Li empereres out sa raisun fenie (CdR 193)
 	 	'the emperor had finished his speech'
In Grammar Point 17 it was noted that if word order in Old French already had strong SVO characteristics, there still are several archaic features, cf. for example the occurrence of SOV in subordinate clauses. Another archaism is the ordering of the direct object between the auxiliary and the perfective participle, as in:

 	 	Li reis ad la culur muee (CdR 441)
 	 	'the king had changed color'
This type of construction goes back to the original Latin construction in which a lexical verb 'have' combined with a direct object determined by a perfective participle, cf.:

 	 	epistulas	 	scriptas	 	habeo
 	 	letters-Acc.fem	 	written-Acc.fem.sg.	 	have-1sg.pers.
 	 	'I have letters that are written'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	puer epistulas scriptas habet
 	 	'the boy has letters that are written'
It would go too far to discuss the development of habeo into a Romance auxiliary, but it is clear that when habeo changed position, a so-called brace construction emerged, cf.:

 	 	puer habet epistulas scriptas
In Old French:

 	 	li gars a letres escrites
At later stages:

 	 	le garçon a escrit(es) les letres
The brace construction survived in Old French for a long time: instances are still found in the 17th century. Yet in the Old French documents, one observed a gradual decline in occurrence.

Examples in Old French:

 	 	ad sun tens uset (CdR 523)
 	 	'he has finished his time'
 	 	 
 	 	par tant teres ad sun cors travaillet (CdR 540)
 	 	'he has burdened his body by all these countries'
 	 	 
 	 	Guenes li fels ad nostre mort juree (CdR 1456)
 	 	'Ganelon the traitor has sworn to our death'

Lesson 8
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
During the 12th century new techniques in agriculture were developed and, as a result, crop harvests increased dramatically. Consequently the population was better nourished, more productive, and achieved greater wealth; commerce could expand. Towns grew, becoming more important centers of regional and national commercial activity and craftsmanship. In the 13th century, with the foundation of universities, towns became centers of academic activity as well. In addition to the Church and the Aristocracy, a third non-peasant class emerged, the bourgeoisie. Members of this class not only played their own roles within medieval society, but also were organized in (professional) institutions, and developed a cultural life of their own reflected in literature and theater, the littérature bourgeoise.

The literary audience was broader and less refined than that of the littérature courtoise. The texts, mainly narratives in a rather loose style, were more openly joyful. Narrative texts can be divided into religious works (e.g. Les Miracles de la Vierge) and comic texts featuring animals. There was also a growing production of plays, religious and comic (see Lesson 9). The animal texts are either short narratives that fit the long-lasting tradition of fables (fabliaux), or longer texts, among them the Roman de Renart. The fabliaux are meant to make people laugh, but they also present wise lessons, based on critical observations of mankind. The characters are animals, presenting the characteristics of their species in combination with typically human behavior. In fact, the fabliaux present a disguised form of social satire and criticism. All groups in society are represented. The texts also offer a lively description of everyday medieval life and society.

The Roman de Renart (late 12th and early 13th centuries) is a series of poems relating the adventures of the fox Renart.

The fabliaux continue a long tradition that is rooted in the East (India), and came to Greece (e.g. Aesop) and Rome (e.g. Phaedrus). A manuscript of the Latin fables allegedly of Phaedrus made it into the Middle Ages and was translated around 1180 by the well-known author Marie de France, with the title Isopet. In the 13th century the word Isopet refers to any collection of fables.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text for this lesson is the fable Du Renart et du Corbet (Isopet 1.15). Isopet I is a 13th century collection of fables by an unknown author. The fable selected here is part of a long tradition and, with La Fontaine in the 17th century, became one of the best known stories in French literature. It is a story of animals criticizing man's greed for glory. The main characters are the Raven, who is vain, and the Fox, who is the incarnation of slyness and deception. Another character is mentioned, Hersen, who in the Roman de Renart is the wife of the wolf Ysengrin, Renart's opponent. Hersen spends her life spinning and represents simple life without claims to fame.

Translation
Sir Tiercelin, the Raven,
Who thinks he is attractive and handsome,
Had a cheese in his beak
Renart, who has done much harm,
Ran through the forest hunting
Like someone who would die of great hunger.
He saw him hold the cheese;
He knows well that he cannot get to it
Unless by craft and cheating.
"Ha," says Renart, "dear Tiercelin,
You who are of noble lineage,
It is a pity that you do not sing
As well as did your father.
If you sang as well, by St Peter,
I think that there would be no bird
In the entire forest who would please all that much."
The Raven, who does not notice
That Renart deceives and misleads him,
And who thinks that he will please with his singing,
Puts such great zeal in his singing
That his cheese fell.
Renart was not surprised,
Who appreciated his singing very little;
Renart has taken the cheese immediately,
And ate it completely
Tiercelin never had a portion of it.
The Raven was very sorry about it,
And his grief increases because of shame.
The lesson:
Whoever looks and hunts for vain glory,
Pursues his fall and his disgrace.
False honor, this you can understand,
Often causes very great pain.
The crazy people who pursue vain glory
Are used to drinking much disgrace;
Glory puts them out of their senses.
I consider lady Hersen wiser
Who wants to draw threat from her distaff;
And for that reason I do not have to disgrace her.
Whoever wants to be too visible,
Will have no protection from deceit.
Grammar
36 Passive
While Latin had a fully developed passive paradigm -- an innovation, from an Indo-European perspective -- Old French had analytic forms to express passive voice, cf.:

 	 	e por o fut presentede Maximiien (Eul. 11, Lesson 4)
 	 	'and for this reason she was brought before Maximian'
 	 	 
 	 	furent desconfit (Conq. 345, Lesson 7)
 	 	'they were defeated'
The passive was not a common structure in Old French, as the texts analyzed in this course illustrate: so far only three passive constructions have been attested.

Generally the agent -- if expressed at all -- is referred to by a prepositional phrase introduced by de, cf.:

 	 	purent petit plaint de la gent (Conq. 345, Lesson 7)
 	 	'they were little mourned by the people'
The prepositions par and a are found as well in this function, albeit not very frequently.

37 Reflexive or Pronominal Verbs
Old French has many more reflexive -- or rather pronominal -- verbs than today's language. That is because many intransitive verbs took the pronominal form, referring to an action that does not involve anything or anyone outside the subject itself, cf.:

 	 	se craindre	 	'fear
 	 	se demorer	 	'remain'
 	 	se dormir	 	'to sleep'
 	 	se feindre	 	'feign'
 	 	se pasmer	 	'faint'
 	 	se douter	 	'to be afraid'
 	 	se morir	 	'to die'
 	 	se perir	 	'to perish'
 	 	se monter	 	'ascend'
 	 	se partir	 	'leave'
 	 	s'apoier	 	'learn'
Several of these verbs exist in non-proniminal form as well, cf. for example demorer 'remain', monter 'ascend, mount', feindre 'behave in a cowardly way', perir 'perish', partir 'leave', morir 'die'.

Not all pronominal verbs of today go back to a reflexive form in the Middle Ages:

 	 	Li reis est par matin levet (CdR 163)
 	 	'the king has gotten up early'
Modern French has the pronominal se lever in this use, cf.:

 	 	le roi s'est levé tôt
In compound tenses the auxiliary is estre, although instances with avoir are attested as well, cf.:

· with auxiliary estre:

 	 	sur l'erbe verte s'i est culchet (CdR 2358, Lesson 2)
 	 	'there he has lain down on the green grass'
· with auxiliary avoir:

 	 	il s'a vestu
 	 	'he has put his clothes on'
For practical reasons, pronominal verbs have not all been identified in the glosses of this course as a separate category. The pronominal element has been identified as a pronoun, with the appropriate case indication, or the verb has been given as se + infinitive (e.g. se pasmer).

38 Nominal Forms of the Verb
Old French has several so-called nominal forms of the verb: while these forms are part of a given verbal paradigm, they express nominal characteristics, such as gender, case, and number, and assume nominal functions. In Old French, the nominal forms of the verb include the perfective participle, the present participle, the gerund, and the infinitive.

· the perfective participle is based on the perfective stem, cf. for example:

 	 	chanter	 	chantet
 	 	fenir	 	fenit
 	 	partir	 	parti
 	 	corre	 	coru
 	 	faire	 	fait
 	 	venir	 	venu
 	 	metre	 	mis
· the present participle is based on the present stem, cf. for example:

 	 	chanter	 	chantant
 	 	finir	 	fenissant
 	 	partir	 	partant
 	 	corre	 	corant
 	 	faire	 	fesant / faisant
 	 	venir	 	venant
 	 	metre	 	met(t)ant
Formally the declension of present participles follows the patterns of class III adjectives, cf.:

Declension of the Present Participle

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. Sg.	 	chantanz	 	chantant / chantanz
Obl. Sg.	 	chantant	 	chantant
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	chantant	 	chantanz
Obl. Pl.	 	chantanz	 	chantanz
· gerunds are formally identical to present participles, but in contrast to these forms, gerunds are invariable.

· infinitives, e.g. chanter 'sing', fenir 'end', partir 'leave', remanoir 'stay', corre 'run'. Infinitives may convey case (see Grammar Point 39) as expressed in the definite article and the case ending.

Declension of the Infinitive

Nom. Sg.	 	li chanters
Obl. Sg.	 	le chanter
The use of a preposition could lead to article enclisis, e.g. du doner 'of the fact of giving'.

39 Nominal Forms of the Verb: Uses
39.1. The infinitive in Old French may function as a noun assuming the function of subject, direct object, or complement in a prepositional phrase, cf.:

· subject:

 	 	tencier est laide chose (Theb. 3924)
 	 	'quarreling is no good'
· object:

 	 	doubtant le retourner de son adversaire (CNN 52.118)
 	 	'afraid of his ennemy's return'
· complement of preposition:

 	 	se seigne a l'entrer el champ (Art. 102.13)
 	 	'he crosses himself when he enterd the battlefield'
 	 	 
 	 	en chanter met si grant estude (Isop. 1.15; this lesson)
 	 	'he puts such great zeal in his singing'
The combining of a preposition + (determiner) + infinitive generally conveys temporal or causal value, manner, means, for example:

· temporal value:

 	 	se seigne a l'entrer el chanp (Art. 102.13)
 	 	'he crosses himself when he enters the battlefield'
 	 	 
 	 	au redrecier
 	 	'at his getting up'
· expressing manner:

 	 	par nos passage paier
 	 	'by paying our crossing'
Infinitive used as a nominal complement, cf.:

 	 	tens est del herberger (CdR 2482)
 	 	'it is time to encamp'
The nominal characteristics of the infinitive are manifest not only in its combining with a definite article, but also in case endings (for forms, see Grammar Point 38), cf.:

 	 	(li) parlers 'the fact of talking'
For example:

 	 	li corners ne nos avreit mester (CdR 1742)
 	 	'blowing the horn would not be of help to us'
Determiners other than definite articles combine with the infinitive as well, cf.:

 	 	jusq'au mien partir
 	 	'until my leaving, until my departure'
Direct objects of infinitives may take either the form of an accusative (verbal syntax) or a genitive (nominal syntax), cf.:

 	 	a l'ouvrir la chambre (CNN 279.55)
 	 	'at the opening of the room'
 	 	 
 	 	li porters dou rainsel
 	 	'the fact of carrying the small branch'
The accusative in this context reflects verbal syntax, showing that the infinitive is considered a fully verbal element. The genitive reflects nominal syntax, showing that the infinitive is considered a nominal element.

Nominal uses of the infinitive survived until the 16th century; today's language has several fossilized forms, cf. le dîner, le déjeuner 'lunch', le devoir 'task', and others.

39.2. The forms in -ant in Old French functioned as present participles and as gerunds, but the distinction between both types of use is not always clear. The form in -ant is commonly attested in prepositional phrases, expressing adverbial value. The phrase may include a possessive:

 	 	a lor vivant	 	'in their lifetime'
 	 	en son dormant	 	'during his sleep'
The prepositional phrase may also include a noun conveying an underlying direct object or subject, cf.:

· subject:

 	 	devant midi sonnant (R. Cambr. 8399)
 	 	'before noon'
 	 	 
 	 	al coc cantant (Brut. 995)
 	 	'at cockcrow'
· direct object:

 	 	a la porte ouvrant
 	 	'at the opening of the door'
 	 	 
 	 	eust grant peur de la teste perdant
 	 	'he was afraid he would lose his head'
Forms in -ant and infinitives may show overlap in some of the prepositional uses, cf.:

 	 	par mes armes portant	 	par noz testes trancher
 	 	'by carrying my arms'	 	'by cutting off our heads'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	en mon dormant vi une vision	 	jusqu'au mien partir
 	 	'I had a vision during my sleep'	 	'until my departure'
By contrast, forms in -ant alone combine with a finite form of the verb to indicate progressive action or to specify the circumstances in which the action conveyed by the main verb is carried out, cf.:

 	 	que Carles diet ... qu'il fut mort cunquerant (CdR 2362-2363)
 	 	'that Charles will say that he died a conqueror'
 	 	 
 	 	desuz un pin i est alet curant (CdR 2357, Lesson 2)
 	 	'he has gone under a tree running'
Forms in -ant in combination with forms of the verb aler or estre specifically convey action in progress, cf.:

 	 	il est as porz passant (CdR 1767)
 	 	'he passes by the ports'
40 Absolute Constructions
Absolute constructions in Old French are residues of a much wider (occurrence and use) phenomenon in earlier times. An absolute construction is a combination of a noun and a participle; both elements agree in number, case and gender and are syntactically completley independent from the other elements in the clause. The noun typically conveys the underlying subject or the direct object of the participle. Latin absolutes typically had the ablative form and they conveyed a wide range of meanings, such as temporal, causal, or conditional value. Cf.:

 	 	armis	 	acceptis	 	Crassus...	 	(Caes., DBG 3.23)
 	 	weapons-Abl.	 	accept-Pf.Part.Abl.pl.	 	Crassus-Nom.	 	 
 	 	'having accepted the weapons, Crassus... '
These constructions survive in Old French--mostly in the oblique case--but their use is rather limited. They often include nouns referring to clothes, bodyparts, and general equipment. They are slightly fossilized and descriptive, cf.:

 	 	juntes ses mains est alet a sa fin (CdR 2392)
 	 	'his hands joined he went to his death'
Their fossilized nature is especially manifest in fixed expressions, such as helmes laciez 'helmets fastened', espee çainte 'sword girded', and others.

Lesson 9
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
The littérature bourgeoise (see Lesson 8) also incorporated many plays, either comic or religious. Theater has its roots in early religious ceremonies. From the 10th century, the liturgy of important Christian holidays (e.g. Christmas) came to include a dramatic representation of the events that were celebrated. Persons in special costumes would represent characters in the holy stories. Gradually, these characters began to exchange sentences and communicate with one another; dialogues became longer, and the sets more sophisticated. In the 12th century, several scenes came to be combined on one stage. When the texts began to include too many non-religious aspects, the stage left the confines of the church and instead was set up outside, in front of the church. French was used increasingly, actors were no longer recruited among priests and other religious figures alone, and the topics became more diverse. Yet the topics within this setting remained religious; they addressed the history of mankind (starting at the Garden of Eden, Le Jeu d'Adam), focused on saints (Le jeu de St. Nicolas), or related stories featuring the Virgin Mary (Le miracle de Théophile).

The Virgin Mary played a most important role in the Middle Ages as a person who would intercede on behalf of sinful Christians, even during their lives. Regretting sin was the primary condition for salvation.

Some of the stories of these plays became very popular indeed, and are found in other forms of art as well. The story of Theophile, for example, which had Greek origins, is represented in the tympan on the north side of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text chosen for this lesson is taken from Le miracle de Théophile (540-580; 585), written by Rutebeuf during the second half of the 13th century. Theophile is a priest to whom injustice is being done by his bishop. He therefore rejects God and instead signs an agreement with the Devil. The Devil, in exchange for Theophile's soul, ensures that Theophile gets back his possessions and standing and prestige. Later Theophile regrets his actions and, in despair, decides to beseech Our Lady to save him.

The fragment selected here presents Theophile petitioning Mary for help. After a first rejection, Mary decides to save him and to wrest the agreement from the Devil.

HERE OUR LADY SPEAKS TO THEOPHILE, AND SHE SAID:
Who are you, who goes through here?
THEOPHILE:
Dear Lady! Have mercy on me!
It is the miserable
Theophile, the unhappy one
Whom devils have tied and taken hold of.
Now I come to pray
To you, Lady, and to beg for mercy,
So that he will not look for the moment that
He will come to torment me, he
Who has put me in such great misery.
You considered me already as your son,
Beloved queen!
OUR LADY SPEAKS:
I do not care about your story.
Go away, go out of my chapel.

Lady, I do not dare.
Flowering wild rose and lily and rose,
In whom the Son of God rests,
What shall I do?
I feel I am badly committed
Towards the furious devil
I do not know what to do :
I will never stop begging!
Virgin, noble maiden,
Honored Lady,
My soul will be devoured completely,
When staying in hell
With Cain.
OUR LADY:
Theophile I have known you
In the past when I had you at my service.
Know for sure,
I will make you have your agreement back
Which you gave away by ignorance.
I go look for it.
HERE OUR LADY LEAVES TO GET THE AGREEMENT OF THEOPHILE
Satan, Satan, are you in prison?
If you have come to this world now
In order to start to trouble my clerk,
You thought so in vain.
Give back the agreement that you got from the clerk
Because you have done too much harm.
SATAN SPEAKS:
Me give it back to you!
I would very much prefer that they hang me! ...
OUR LADY:
And I will trample your belly.

41 Indefinite Elements
There are a number of indefinite elements in Old French, nouns, pronominal elements, adjectival elements.

· Indefinite nouns. Among indefinite nouns, chose (cose) and rien (ren) are the most important and most common. Chose traces back to Latin causam 'cause, business', whereas rien originated in Latin rem 'thing, business'. In Old French, both chose and rien mean 'thing, something, (some) business, person'. The difference between the two elements resides in the occurrence of rien in negated contexts, meaning 'nothing'; cf.:

 	 	ne rien veer 'to see nothing'
It is this negated use that rien preserved into the modern period, cf.:

 	 	il ne mange rien 'he does not eat anything'
· Pronominal and adjectival elements. There is a group of quantifying (quant, tant) and qualifying (tel) elements. As nominal elements, they have declensional paradigms.

Declension of quant, '(how)ever many, (how)ever much'

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. Sg.	 	quanz	 	quante
Obl. Sg.	 	quant	 	quante
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	quant	 	quantes
Obl. Pl.	 	quanz	 	quantes
The student will have noticed that the declension of this element follows the patterns of Class I and Class II adjectives. The group includes tant 'so much, so many' and alquant (auquant) 'certain ones, several', which appear only in the plural.

Declension of tel 'such, such one'

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. Sg.	 	tels, teus	 	tel
Obl. Sg.	 	tel	 	tel
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	tel	 	tels, teus
Obl. Pl.	 	tels	 	tels, teus
· Various lexical qualifiers. In addition there is a series of indefinites that qualify nouns, adjectives, verbs or adverbs: molt 'many, much', poi (pou, peu) 'a little, little', tot 'all, entirely'; cf.:

 	 	Mult grant eschech en unt si chevaler (CdR 99, Lesson 1)
 	 	'his knights had a very large booty'
42 Adverbs
In Lesson 6 adverbs of manner were already discussed. In fact manner adverbs are the most "regular" among the adverbs in Old French. The other adverbs have a variety of etymological backgrounds. Some trace back to preposition, others to particles, and so forth.

· Adverbs of time. Time reference in Old French is conveyed by a group of adverbs, cf.:

 	 	Present	 	 
 	 	ore, ores, or	 	'now'
 	 	maintenant	 	'now'
 	 	(h)ui	 	'today'
 	 	encui	 	'today'
 	 	oan	 	'this year'
 	 	endementres	 	'during'
 	 	anuit	 	'tonight'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Future	 	 
 	 	main	 	'tomorrow'
 	 	demain	 	'tomorrow'
 	 	a piece	 	'in a moment'
 	 	tantost	 	'shortly'
 	 	tost	 	'soon'
 	 	désormais	 	'from now on'
 	 	encore, encor, uncor	 	'yet again'
 	 	adès	 	'soon'
 	 	todis	 	'always'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Past	 	 
 	 	lors	 	'then'
 	 	(h)ier	 	'yesterday'
 	 	l'autrier	 	'the day before yesterday'
 	 	ja, jadis	 	'in the past'
 	 	antan	 	'last year'
 	 	onques	 	'never'
 	 	pieça	 	'long ago'
Pieça is a fossilized form of the temporal expression piece a:

 	 	piece	 	a
 	 	segment of time	 	have-3sg. pres.
 	 	'there has been some time'
· Adverbs of place. Location in space is referred to with a variety of adverbs, among them:

 	 	Here	 	 
 	 	ici, ci	 	'here'
 	 	ça	 	'here, hither'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	In here	 	 
 	 	ceanz	 	'in here'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	There	 	 
 	 	la	 	'there'
 	 	ça	 	'there'
 	 	i	 	'there, thither'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Place where	 	 
 	 	ou	 	'where'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Place from which	 	 
 	 	dont	 	'from which, whence'
 	 	en	 	'thence, away'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Inside	 	 
 	 	leanz	 	'inside, within'
 	 	enz	 	'inside'
 	 	dedenz	 	'inside, within'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Outside	 	 
 	 	hors	 	'outside'
 	 	fors	 	'out, outside'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Above	 	 
 	 	sus	 	'up, above'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Under	 	 
 	 	suz, soz	 	'under, beneath'
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Down	 	 
 	 	jus	 	'down'
43 Prepositions
Prepositions in Old French trace back to a variety of elements: prepositions in Latin, adverbs, participle, and nouns.

· Latin origin. Prepositions going back to Latin prepositions may be either compound forms or non-compound forms:

 	 	a	 	< Lat. ad	 	'at, in, ...'
 	 	sans	 	< Lat. sine + s	 	'without'
 	 	tres	 	< Lat. trans	 	'through'
 	 	de	 	< Lat. de	 	'from'
 	 	contre	 	< Lat. contra	 	'against'
 	 	en	 	< Lat. in	 	'in'
In spoken Latin many prepositions were combined to form new prepositions, several of which subsequently surivive in (Old) French; see, for example:

 	 	avan	 	< La. ab + ante	 	'before'
 	 	devant	 	< La. de + ab + ante	 	'in front of'
 	 	envers	 	< La. in + versus	 	'in the direction of'
· Adverbs. Several prepositions trace back to adverbs, such as:

 	 	hors	 	'out of'
 	 	dans	 	'in'
· Nouns. The prepositions chez 'at' and lez 'beside' originally were nouns. Chez traces back to Latin casa 'hous', whereas lez originates in La. latus 'side'.

· Participles. In the later stages of Old French, participles came to be used as prepositions as well; mostly present participles, cf.:

Present participles:

 	 	suivant	 	'following'
 	 	moyennant	 	'through'
 	 	durant	 	'during'
 	 	pendant	 	'during'
Perfective participles:

 	 	hormis	 	'with the exception of'
 	 	excepté	 	'with the exception of'
44 Subordinate Conjunction, que
The conjunction que in Old French has a very rich use. It may simply connect a subordinate clause to the main clause, it may also express intensity ('so that'), intention ('so that'), cause, reason, or concession ('because', 'although'), and simply 'and'. Examples:

· Connecting element, cf.:

 	 	Ço sent Rollant que la mort le tresprent (CdR, 2355, Lesson 2)
 	 	'Roland feels that death overcomes him completely'
· Intention, cf.:

 	 	Congié ... li requiert ... d'aler tornoier
 	 	que l'an ne l'apialt recreant. (Yv. 2563, Lesson 6 )
 	 	'he asks permission to fight in tornaments'
 	 	'so that they do not call him a coward'
 	 	 
 	 	Pur ço l'ad fait que il voelt veirement (CdR 2361, Lesson 2)
 	 	'for this reason he has done this that he really wants'
· Cause, reason, concession, cf.:

 	 	La dame tantost li otroie,
 	 	qu'el ne set qu'il vialt demander (Yv., 2556)
 	 	'the lady immediately grants it to him,
 	 	'although she does not know what he wants to ask'
45 Facts: Numbers, Distances, Measures, Time
· Numbers. In Old French texts, numbers are either spelled out in full or are rendered by Roman numbers. When Roman numbers are used, the number is preceded and followed by a dot.

· Numerals. Numerals in Old French are decimal, continuing a long tradition in Indo-European. During the Middle Ages, vigesimals emerge in various languages in Western Europe, among them Old French. They are also attested in other Medieval Romance languages as well as Germanic and Celtic languages. They are used specifically in combination with elements that typically are counted: agricultural products, coins, measures, and so forth. From the 16th and 17th centuries vigesimals became less frequent again. Numerals like quatre-vingts in modern French therefore are residues of a much wider use (see Grammar Point 48 in Lesson 10 for references).

· Time. As pointed out in Lesson 3, the calendar of the Church determined life in the Middle Ages to a great extent. The year, for example, is organized around important Christian holidays or around important days in the liturgy of the Church. These special days are used in reference to time, cf.:

 	 	pansez de tost venir arriere
 	 	a tot le moins jusqu'a un an
 	 	huit jorz aprés la Saint Johan (Yv., 2574-2576, Lesson 6)
 	 	'at the very least within one year
 	 	'make sure to come back in time
 	 	'eight days after the feast of St. John'
Reference is systematic as is the structure of the Church calendar. Epiphany, for example, is set on the Twelfth Night following Christmas (i.e. on January 6); Easter is set on the first Sunday following the first full moon after March 21; Lent is set during the forty days preceding Easter; Pentecost (cf. Gk. pentekostos 'fiftieth') is celebrated on the 50th day after Easter and is preceded ten days before by Ascension.

Hour indication in Medieval texts is quite relative, and follows Roman habits. The 24-hour day itself is divided into two important parts, the daylight part and the night part, each of twelve hours. The twelve hours divide each of these segments. Consequently, the length of the individual hours varies according to season. An hour at night in summer, for example, is much shorter than an hour at day in summer or an hour at night in winter. In addition, Old French had several adverbs indicating moments of the day; several of them are related to prayer habits in monasteries, cf.:

 	 	vespres	 	'early evening', 'sunset', when it gets dark
 	 	 	 	[early evening prayers]
 	 	complie	 	'evening', around 9 PM
 	 	 	 	[prayers of thanks for the completed day]
 	 	laudes	 	between 3 AM and dawn
 	 	 	 	[laudative songs at dawn]
 	 	matins	 	'early morning'
 	 	 	 	first canonical hour, between midnight and dawn
 	 	 	 	[first prayers in the morninng]
The hours are referred to with ordinal numbers, e.g.:

 	 	prime	 	'sunrise', around 6 AM
 	 	terce	 	'mid morning, around 9 AM
 	 	midi	 	'midday'
 	 	none	 	'nineth hour', 'mid afternoon', around 3 PM
· Distance/length. Distance and length are measured in a way not found in a metrical system: the measuring unit varies with the type of length and the object, and there is no consistent correlation between the individual units (as there is between a centiment, a decimeter, a meter, a kilometer, and so forth). The safest strategy for the student/reader is to check the individual instances of distance indication that are encountered. A few measures are relatively frequent:

 	 	pié	 	'a foot', a measure used in Antiquity; approx. 30 cm.
 	 	pouz	 	'a thumb', approx. 2.7 cm. (there are twelve pouz in one pié)
 	 	lieue	 	'a Gallic mile', approx. 4-5 km. (roughly three sea miles)
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Granz 'XXX' liwes ... (CdR, 1756, Lesson 2)
 	 	'a long thirty miles away'
The absolute value of these measures often varies with the region.

· Monetary system. The monetary system, which during the Middle Ages reaches isolated parts of the countryside as well, has strong local characteristics. While the official monetary system based on pounds (Fr. livres) becomes increasingly important for commercial and tax reasons, local systems continues to be used as well. The pound includes 20 shillings, each of twelve pennies, and goes back to Charlemagne's reform of the monetary system.

Lesson 10
Brigitte L.M. Bauer and Jonathan Slocum
Students will have noticed that translations played an important role in medieval French literature: texts in languages other than French, most commonly Latin, were indeed an important source of inspiration. In addition, the gradual spread of translations shows the increasing importance of French as a language of communication -- that is, in registers other than the day-to-day spoken varieties.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text selected for this lesson is from Le voyage de St. Brandan, a translation of the Latin Navigatio. Brendan was a 6th century Irish Benedictine monk who had founded a monastery on an island and one day set out to sail to the "Promised Land" situated in the West, which he reaches after seven years. His adventures have been related in the Latin Navigatio, which in all likelihood is a collection of stories of a sea-faring nation.

The Irish in the (early) Middle Ages were well-known for their marine skills, and they had the habit of traveling regularly from one island to another. That the Navigatio may have more to it than just imagination became clear in 1976 and 1977, when an expedition proved that it is possible to cross the Atlantic Ocean and reach North America while taking a northerly route in Irish skin boats (see references below). During their journey in the 1970s, the crew regularly came across phenomena that could be identified as the ordeals described in the text of the Navigatio. If the adventures related in the Navigatio indeed reflect stories of Irish people travelling to North America, then the Irish discovered that continent long before Columbus, or even the Vikings.

The Latin text, which also had a Germanic version, was translated into Old French no later than the second half of the 13th century.

The fragment chosen here relates the beginnings of Brendan's odyssey. Brendan is head of a monastery at Clonfert when he receives a visit from another monk, St. Barind. St. Barind tells him that he has been visiting his godson, Mernoc, who had left him to live as an anchorite and has founded a new monastery on an island. Mernoc invites St. Barind to travel to the "Promised Land," which is described as rich in flowers and fruits and providing plenty of food. Hearing about these possibilities, Brendan selects a group of monks and decides to seek the "Promised Land" himself.

Lesson Text
Cis Barintes commencha a plourer et se coucha a terre
et demoura longhement en orisons. Mais sains Brandains le leva de terre
et le baisa si dist:
Bials pere pour coi auons nous tristeche en te venue
Enne venistes vous a no consolation. Tu nous dois miex esleechier que courechier.
Demoustre nous le parolle diu
e refai nos ames des divers miracles que tu as veus en le mer. Dont commencha a dire sains Barintes a saint Brandain d'une isle et dist:
Mes fils Mernoc pourueeres des poures ihu crist
se departi de devant mi et iestres curieus. Il trouva une isle dales le mont de piere
qui est apielee par non isle delisieuse.
Apries une grant pieche de tans me fu nonchiet
qu'il auoit pluiseurs moines aueoc lui. Et que dex auoit demonstre molt de miracles par lui
En tel maniere alai a lui pour visiter men filluel

Translation
This Barind started to cry and lay down on the soil
And remained for a long time in prayers.
But St. Brendan lifted him up from the ground
And kissed him and said :
Dear father why do we have sadness at your arrival ?
Did you not come to our consolation ?
You have to make us happy rather than make us sad
Show us the word of God
And repair our souls with the various miracles that you have seen on sea.
Then St. Barind started to talk to St. Brendan about an island and he said :
My son Mernoc, purveyor of the poor of Jesus Christ
Left me and a safe way of life.
He found an island next to the mountain of stone
which is called by the name delicious island.
After a long period of time I was told
That he had several monks with him.
And that God had shown many miracles through him
In such way I went to him to visit my godson
And when I was close to three days under way
He hastened in order to meet me with his brothers.
Because Our Lord had made my arrival known to him.
