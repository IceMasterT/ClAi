Tocharian Online
Series Introduction
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum

Tocharian denotes two closely related languages of the Indo-European family, denoted simply Tocharian A and Tocharian B. Though quite similar, Tocharian A and B are now considered by most scholars to be two distinct languages, and not merely two dialects of one common language. It is still common practice, however, to use the term Tocharian to refer to both languages when no particular distinction needs to be made. The phrase "the Tocharian language" should be understood in this sense, not as implying any dialectal status of either A or B, but rather as a common euphemism for the two languages considered in terms where their differences are irrelevant.

Geographic Location
The Tocharian languages were first discovered in documents unearthed in expeditions to Chinese Turkestan (East Turkestan, or Xinjiang); the sites are located along what was once the Silk Road. One primary site of Tocharian remains is Turfan. Turfan lies to the north of the Tarim Basin, a depression situated to the northeast of the Takla Makan Desert. A second major source of Tocharian documents is Kučā, a city to the west of Turfan, in the center of the northern boundary of the Takla Makan Desert. A third major site, Tumšuq, forms the extreme western boundary of Tocharian finds. This lies along the northern rim of the desert, between Kučā and Kašgʰar, a city at the desert's western extreme.

Tocharian A is found only in the region of Turfan and Qārāšahr (Karashahr), a nearby oasis located to the west roughly midway between Turfan and Kučā. Tocharian B, by contrast, is found throughout the entirety of this branch of the Silk Road, from Turfan in the east to Tumšuq in the west. Some sources therefore refer to Tocharian A as East Tocharian or Turfanian, since Turfan is at the easternmost extent of the Tocharian sites. Occasionally it is termed Agnean, referring to the Sanskrit designation Agni for Qārāšahr. In this context, Tocharian B is referred to as West Tocharian (though it is found in the east, too) or Kuchean.

Tocharian Texts
The Tocharian documents all date to a period roughly between the sixth and eighth centuries AD. The materials are predominantly translations of Buddhist texts which were in common circulation in Central Asia. This of course is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, the well-known content assists in the process of decipherment; on the other hand, it provides very little information about the people who spoke the language. There are, however, some texts that are not translations of Buddhist progenitors, including monastic and business letters, caravan passes, and graffiti. These secular documents are all written in Tocharian B, leading some scholars to conclude that Tocharian A, by the time the surviving documents were written, may already have been an extinct language, preserved only as the liturgical language -- much as Latin was, in Europe. The relative paucity of such secular documents, however, necessarily makes such conclusions tentative.

Most of the Tocharian texts were in origin parts of monastic library collections, or left in monasteries as votive offerings. Often, parts of these documents were picked up by the wind and swept out into the desert, making the number of complete Tocharian documents quite small and making the manner of recovery at times haphazard. The Tocharian documents are not found in isolation. Tocharian manuscripts from monastery libraries naturally lie side by side with Sanskrit manuscripts of the same era. At times texts in other languages, such as Old Persian and Uyghur, are found alongside the Tocharian texts. Occasionally documents in gāndʰārī, a Middle Indic language, are found in the same areas, but they date to an earlier era. The texts themselves were predominantly written in a variant of the north Indian Brāhmī script, which was also used for the nearby Middle Iranian language Tumshuqese. There are however some Tocharian B documents that employ Manichean script (used to spread writings of the Manichean religion, which originated in the Mesopotamian region).

The Name "Tocharian"
The name "Tocharian" (German Tocharisch) was proposed first by F. W. K. Müller in 1907, and a year later by the renowned pair of Tocharianists Sieg and Siegling. This name is now thought to be a misnomer, but nevertheless remains due to sheer inertia and the lack of a definitive replacement.

The origin of the name goes back to the discovery of an Old Turkic (Uyghur) text Maitrisimit nom bitig, a translation of the Buddhist Sanskrit Maitreyasamiti-Nāṭaka. The colophon of the work states (Adams, pp. 2-3):

"The sacred book Maitreya-samiti which the Bodhisattva guru ācārya Āryacandra, who was born in the country of Nagaradeśa, had composed in the Twγry languages out of the Indian language, and which the guru ācārya Prajñarakṣita, who was born in Il-bliq, translated from the Twγry language into the Turkish language."
Thus a certain Āryacandra composed the original work here referred to as Maitrisimit nom bitig. This is the same name as the composer of the Indic Maitreyasamiti-Nāṭaka, so that the identification of the original text appears to be solid. Apparently this work was then translated into toxrï (Twγry), and from that translated by the present author, Prajñarakṣita, into Old Turkic (Uyghur).

Sieg and Siegling assumed that the intermediary language, toxrï, was the language which is the subject of these lessons, and that this language toxrï is identical to Greek To'kʰaroi and Sanskrit Tukʰāra, denoting inhabitants of Bactria. In some scholarly accounts, the inhabitants of this area were known as the Indo-Scythians, and so Sieg and Siegling proposed the name Tocharisch for the language of the Indo-Scythians.

Research and newly discovered documents have proven this identification to be untenable. The language of the Indo-Scythians is now termed Bactrian, and this language has left a number of loanwords in the languages now termed Tocharian. Tocharian, however, seems not to have left any linguistic traces in Bactrian, so these two cultures were likely never in direct contact.

What is clear is that toxrï is the name of Tocharian from the point of view of the Turkic people. This term, however, does not appear in the Tocharian languages themselves. In Tocharian A we find ārśi as a term likely denoting the Tocharians themselves. In Tocharian B we find the adjective kuśiññe, derived from kuśi (also kuci), the name of a dynasty and state also known from Chinese documents. The Turkic people also mention a language küšän (also küsän) from the Tarim Basin. One bilingual document listing first Sanskrit and then Tocharian B has the pair tokʰarikaḥ : kucaññe iṣṭʰake, but this is not as helpful as one would hope, since tokʰarika (Gk. To'kʰaroi ?) is not the name of any known people.

The Position of Tocharian in Indo-European
In terms of geography, Tocharian is the easternmost of all the ancient Indo-European languages. Tocharian also appears to be a so-called centum language, meaning that the Proto-Indo-European palatovelars became true velars. This, coupled with its geographical location, came as a shock to the historical linguistics community. The other centum languages included the Celtic, Germanic, Italic, and Hellenic branches of Indo-European -- all located to the west of the ancient Indo-European speech community. Tocharian thus broke down the geographical interpretation of the centum-satem dialectal division, which held that the centum speakers formed a western dialect group in the original Indo-European community, and the satem speakers, an eastern group.

Though certainly Indo-European in heritage, Tocharian shows a number of departures from its historical source. In particular, it is notable for having a reduced phonetic inventory in comparison to other Indo-European languages, the Tocharian stop consonants (e.g. p, t, k) being all voiceless (e.g. no equivalents to English b, d, g). Tocharian likewise seems to have lost a number of original cases of the Indo-European noun, and then developed a new and enlarged system. These cases tend to have what linguists call an agglutinative structure similar to that found in Japanese or in Turkic languages (among others), and this combined with the reduced inventory of stop consonants leads many scholars to believe that Tocharian went through a long period of extended contact with western and central Asian language groups such as Uralic, Turkic, and Mongolian. (The above technical terms will be explained in the course of the lessons, but the reader may at any time use the Table of Contents to locate discussion of a particular topic.)

Lesson 1
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Proto-Indo-European: a Brief Overview
The Tocharian languages are important objects of study for two principal reasons: first, they offer a window into the spread of Buddhism beyond the more well-studied confines of India and Southeast Asia; and second, they bring a new perspective to our understanding of the language of the Indo-Europeans and the migrations of subgroups of this population. The latter point concerns us in this section.

The relation of Tocharian to the other Indo-European languages is not an incidental fact only of interest to historical linguists. This relation in fact has useful pedagogical implications. This can be seen by imagining the ways in which one might approach the learning of Tocharian. On the one hand since, on a synchronic level, at the time of the Tocharian documents the language seemed to be a relative isolate, we may study the language in isolation. From that point of view we are free to organize our description of the language in any manner whatsoever. But in doing so, the language will appear a fairly complex jumble of facts, given the number of nominal and verbal paradigms, and we will have little recourse to bring to bear in any coherent sense knowledge we may have gained from the study of other languages.

On the other hand, we may use a knowledge of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) as an organizing principle. A reader may wonder how, if he or she does not already know Proto-Indo-European, this could be a benefit at all. When a historical linguist speaks of "Proto-Indo-European", in the strictest sense this simply denotes a collection of information about the common traits of a large swath of languages spreading in archaic times from Iceland to India (and now China, as these lessons will help demonstrate). From this viewpoint, understanding some information about Proto-Indo-European shows one how knowledge of certain individual languages --- e.g. English, French, Spanish, German, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit --- can be imported systematically to the understanding of several additional languages. Specifically, by stating that Tocharian is like, or unlike, PIE in certain specific respects, we may thus view Tocharian against the backdrop of a large number of well-studied languages. In this way, for example, a Buddhist scholar who knows Sanskrit may not only use his or her knowledge of Sanskrit Buddhist vocabulary in learning Tocharian vocabulary; but he or she may also use Sanskrit grammatical structure as a point of comparison for the understanding of Tocharian grammatical structure. Certainly he or she will draw parallels between Tocharian and Sanskrit when they show obvious similarities, as anyone would do in learning a new subject of any sort. But the PIE perspective adds more: one finds out how certain features of PIE still extant in Sanskrit --- but not in Tocharian --- may have developed through a logical sequence of steps into what one actually finds in Tocharian. Thus even the differences between Tocharian and other languages like Sanskrit often become logical in a certain manner of speaking. Moreover, one finds that these similarities and differences are linked to a large number of other languages which the reader may go on to study in the future.

A specific example may help to illustrate the point. Consider the Tocharian verb AB āk- 'lead', whose present tense active forms we list below.

Present	 	A	 	B
Active	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	ākam	 	ākau
2	 	āśt	 	āśt
3	 	āśäṣ	 	āśäṃ
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	ākamäs	 	ākem(o)
2	 	āśäc	 	āścer
3	 	ākeñc	 	ākeṃ
Note the seemingly haphazard alternation of the root-final consonant between -k- and -ś-. As given above, one must simply memorize which forms should have -ś-, with no apparent rhyme or reason. However, if we set beside the above forms the paradigm of the Greek root ag- 'lead', we find the following.

Present	 	A	 	B	 	Greek
Active	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	ākam	 	ākau	 	ág-ō
2	 	āśt	 	āśt	 	ág-eis
3	 	āśäṣ	 	āśäṃ	 	ág-ei
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	ākamäs	 	ākem(o)	 	ág-omen
2	 	āśäc	 	āścer	 	ág-ete
3	 	ākeñc	 	ākeṃ	 	ág-ousi
We see that Tocharian shows the original -k- precisely where the Greek ending shows an o-type vowel, and Tocharian shows -ś- precisely where the Greek ending shows an e-type vowel. The PIE perspective formalizes this relation, stipulating what features of PIE the Greek paradigm reflects, and how those PIE features propagated within Tocharian. If the reader does not happen to be familiar with Greek, this poses little problem; Indo-European languages are numerous, and Tocharian is related to all of them. By virtue of the fact that these lessons are in English, we can rest assured that the reader knows at least one (other) Indo-European language!

With this in mind, the organization of the present work will pay attention to how Tocharian developed out of PIE. Remarkably, this attention to the historical development of Tocharian from PIE not only serves as a useful mnemonic for, e.g., when root-final -k- shifts to -ś-. A second benefit derives from taking a slightly more "substantial" view of PIE, that is, by saying that PIE or something very similar was in fact a real language spoken by a real group of inhabitants of a certain area. Endowing PIE with substance in this way, and adding the postulate that (in the age before telecommunication) divergences in linguistic features correspond to increasing geographical isolation, the historical linguist may map linguistic changes onto rather coarse-grained routes of migration. That is, sometimes the way in which a language changes tells us about where its speakers have been. In this manner, when the predominantly Buddhist texts of Tocharian fail to tell us about where the Tocharians came from, the structures of the language can speak for themselves and reveal parts of their history otherwise lost to the dust.

Phonology
Historical linguistics opened up as a scientific discipline with the recognition that sound changes are regular. That is to say, if a sound change occurs in a speech community, that change occurs in a fashion almost exclusively conditioned by phonetic environment, not by what particular word the sound happens to be found in. Thus for example, the change of ā to o that took Old English bān to Modern English bone affected not only the ā of the word bān, but all ās throughout the language. Hence hām also became home.

Given this regularity, that is, this ability to describe the "laws" of sound changes, the historical linguistic endeavor begins to resemble that of physics. In physics, the great minds discover by hook or by crook the rules by which to derive the final states of systems given knowledge of their initial states. Similarly in historical linguistics, and specifically historical phonology, one postulates an initial state -- the phonological system of Proto-Indo-European -- and applies rules of sound change to this initial state in order to arrive at the phonological systems of the daughter languages.

If one knows the sound rules, then one only needs the starting point to arrive at the end result. In historical linguistic terms, one calls the starting point (for the languages that concern us here) Proto-Indo-European. If one knows the rules that take the phonemes of PIE to, say, the phonemes of Latin, then all one needs is the starting point -- the phonological inventory of PIE -- to predict the phonological inventory of Latin. Of course, in practice the situation is a little more difficult, on the one hand because one has to work in reverse (e.g. we already know the phonological system of Latin), and on the other hand because neither the PIE phonological system nor the rules of derivation are known a priori. Thus one must hypothesize a PIE phonological system, hypothesize rules of derivation, and then change one or both in a give-and-take manner until one can cogently arrive at the phonological system of Latin with a minimum of exceptions to the rules. (This is not as ad hoc or "unscientific" as it may appear: after all, in physics one knows the outcome of experiments. Given that, one then has to reason or guess to figure out a law that explains those results. Only then may one proceed to try to predict new results using the law that explained the old results.) These rules are generally in the form of correspondences, stating that some specific PIE sound corresponds to an equally specific Latin sound (perhaps with the attendant necessity of specifying the surrounding environment in which one sound corresponds to the other). The following table shows an example of correspondences between PIE and Latin phonemes.

PIE	 	Latin	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	PIE	 	Latin	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	PIE	 	Latin	 	 
 	 	Init.	 	Med.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Init.	 	Med.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Init.	 	Med.
*p	 	p	 	p	 	 	 	 	 	*b	 	b	 	b	 	 	 	 	 	*bʰ	 	f	 	b
*t	 	t	 	t	 	 	 	 	 	*d	 	d	 	d	 	 	 	 	 	*dʰ	 	f	 	d (b)
*k	 	c	 	c	 	 	 	 	 	*g	 	g	 	g	 	 	 	 	 	*gʰ	 	h (f)	 	g (h)
*kʷ	 	qu	 	qu	 	 	 	 	 	*gʷ	 	v	 	v	 	 	 	 	 	*gʷʰ	 	f	 	gu (v)
This says, for example, that the initial *gʰ- and the medial *-bʰ- of PIE *gʰabʰ- correspond respectively to the h- and -b- of Latin habēre 'have'.

One may ask: where does this get us? After all, we already knew the Latin phonological system! A simple example may illustrate the point. Grimm's Law is the well-known set of rules relating the PIE phonetic inventory to the Germanic phonetic inventory. Simply applying Grimm's Law to the PIE root *gʰabʰ- leads one eventually to Modern English give. Thus, Latin habēre 'have' is related to Modern English give, and not to the Modern English word have, though they look similar orthographically. The point: one infers that perhaps the original PIE root *gʰabʰ- must have originally contained semantic elements of both 'give' and 'have'. This correspondence and others among etymologically related words across the Indo-European languages allow historical linguists to reconstruct, not just a Proto-Indo-European language, but a Proto-Indo-European culture based on ties of reciprocal giving. Presented as such, this hypothesis would be nothing more than a vague speculation. But further investigation shows that cultural traits of just this sort remain preserved in the Greek literary heritage of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. The impact is twofold: First, we may then see these traits of Homeric culture not as an isolated idiosyncracy, but as a traditional viewpoint maintained over the centuries; second, we gain insight into the Proto-Indo-European culture itself, a culture which left no written records whatsoever, merely by careful consideration of rules relating the sounds of the languages of the daughter cultures!

In the early period of historical linguistic investigation, familiarity with ancient languages like Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and Gothic and with their modern relatives such as Italian, Modern Greek, Hindi, and German, led scholars to believe that the evolution of languages followed a general principle of phonological and morphological simplification. In postulating the phonological system of PIE, scholars thus posited the most ornate of the systems they had encountered, which happened to be that of Sanskrit. The various points of stop consonant articulation, such as the lips, then had a complete series of four phonemes: *p, *pʰ, *b, *bʰ. Similarly for the dental stops, palatals, and velars. Sanskrit was thus supposed to be the only language to keep the stops unchanged, while other languages simply lost one or other of the consonants.

With closer inspection of the relationships among the Indo-European languages, as well as the discovery of hitherto unknown members of the family such as Hittite, whose documents were older than those of any other Indo-European language but whose consonant inventory was far simpler than that of Sanskrit, scholars finally had to abandon the equation of the Sanskrit and PIE systems. In the common understanding of the PIE consonant inventory, there are no voiceless aspirates (e.g. *pʰ), but only voiceless non-aspirates (e.g. *p), voiced non-aspirates (*b), and voiced aspirates (*bʰ).

The current reconstruction of the PIE system of stop consonants is given in the following table.

 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Palatal	 	Velar	 	Labiovelar
Voiceless	 	p	 	t	 	ḱ	 	k	 	kʷ
Voiced	 	b	 	d	 	ǵ	 	g	 	gʷ
Voiced Asp.	 	bʰ	 	dʰ	 	ǵʰ	 	gʰ	 	gʷʰ
The labiovelar consonants are similar to their velar counterparts, but with a simultaneous rounding of the lips. Examples of their remnants in daughter languages are Latin quid, Hittite kwit, Old English hwæt (this initial labiovelar is still preserved in some pronunciations of Modern English what, e.g. in midwestern dialects of the United States).

Centum vs. Satem
In truth, no ancient Indo-European language maintains all of the Indo-European stop consonants intact. One of the major changes that occurs between the period of PIE and that of the daughter languages is the merger of series (that is, the merger of columns in the preceding table). The principal merger is that between velars and palatals on the one hand, and between velars and labiovelars on the other hand. These mergers divide the IE languages into two groups, called the centum and satem groups. Specifically, the groups show mergers as follows.

In Centum languages, velars merge with palatals while labiovelars remain distinct;
In Satem languages, velars merge with labiovelars while palatals remain distinct.
The general situation is outlined in the following chart.

Mergers	 	Centum	 	PIE	 	Satem
 	 	*kʷ	 	*kʷ	 	*k
 	 	*k	 	*k	 	*k
 	 	*k	 	*ḱ	 	*ḱ
There are similar correspondences for the voiced non-aspirates, e.g. PIE *g, and the voiced aspirates, e.g. PIE *gʰ. The following chart provides a specific illustration of the above.

Examples	 	Latin	 	PIE	 	Sanskrit
 	 	quod	 	*kʷod	 	kát
 	 	cruor	 	*kreuh₂	 	kravíṣ
 	 	centum	 	*ḱṃtóm	 	śata'm
One may liken this process to a much later change which took place within the Romance language family, whereby the c- (pronounced [k]) of Latin centum became the c- (pronounced [s]) of Spanish cien. This shows a similar assibilation process to that found in the satem group, though the change in the Romance group occurred thousands of years later.

This merger of PIE series had the effect of giving all the ancient IE languages situated to the east a common linguistic trait, and similarly all those to the west a common trait. Specifically, the language families grouped as follows.

Centum: Celtic, Germanic, Italic, Greek;
Satem: Balto-Slavic, Albanian, Armenian, Indo-Iranian.
The centum and satem dialectal grouping thus correlated with a geographic grouping, much the way the use of y'all distinguishes Southern American English from other American English dialects.

The discovery of Tocharian, however, put an end to this neat correlation between linguistic and geographic affiliation. The Tocharian word for 'hundred' is A känt B kante, showing an initial velar k-. This squarely associates Tocharian with the other centum subfamilies. The latter lie in the west, however, while Tocharian alone among them appears in the east. Thus Tocharian's linguistic traits undercut the correlation between geography and the centum-satem division, in much the same way that y'all would fail to distinguish Southern American English from northern dialects if that pronoun suddenly were to become common in, say, Connecticut.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following text is an excerpt in Tocharian A from the Buddhist Puṇyavanta-Jātaka. This text was initially published in Sieg and Siegling's Tocharische Sprachreste, Leipzig 1921. Somewhat later George Lane published the text and translation in English in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 67, No. 1 (Jan. -- Mar. 1947), 33-53. Though much has been learned about Tocharian in the time since Lane's translation, the article still remains a very useful starting point, providing a translation that generally remains close to the original text.

As Lane points out, the Tocharian text does not provide a previously unknown text; the Puṇyavanta-Jātaka was already known to scholarship via Sanskrit texts. This is often the case with Tocharian manuscripts. What is revealing, however, is that as Sieg et al. and Lane note, the Tocharian version turns the style of composition on its head. Rather than giving prominence to the actual exploits of the story's protagonists (as is done in the Sanskrit version), the Tocharian version instead gives overwhelming prominence to the stories told before the protagonists start their journey. The Tocharian version also downplays some of the erotic overtones found in the Mahāvastu version, thus showing a different moral perspective. Such changes hold interest for the Buddhist scholar in delineating the fluidity of Buddhist doctrine within the different cultures in which it took hold. But they also hold interest for the Tocharian scholar inasmuch as they are clues to the cultural fabric of the Tocharian peoples themselves.

A linguistic study of the text shows features of a languages in transition. In particular we note in verse 10 the phrase poñcäṃ saṃsāris --- a noun in the genitive takes a modifier in the oblique. We will see in the course of the next few lessons how this demonstrates that the new inflectional cases being generated within the Tocharian language family are beginning to overtake the older inflectional cases inherited directly from the common parent of the Indo-European languages.

Translation
1 "The good fame of the strong spreads in the ten directions.
Reverence, respect, obeisance, (and) honor (are) to be attained through strength from everyone.
To be conquered quickly (are) enemies. To be obtained quickly (is) prosperity.

Nets with four sorts of Sphatika thread guarding the royal house of king Sagara, the great, awful Nagas having traversed completely, he obtained the Cintamani-stone, the precious, from king Sagara. Of all Jambudvipa the sickness he caused to disappear. 9 And so (in samner-meter):
"The ocean difficult to cross the strong cross.

Strength is not capable of performing a disgrace (even) to a small degree.
10 "There is not another thing (which has) become (lit. turned) so for the injury of the entire world as (has) sloth. 11 For formerly of men without work (there) was chaffless rice to eat. In the kalpa-trees ready prepared for them to wear were clothing and ornaments. 12 The rice of the slothful (man) (to be had) by gathering and the kalpa-trees disappeared for them. Miseries (?) were plainly before them. 13 Without work (and) without chaff the rice disappeared for them. By great labor and with chaff a store of grain was for them. 14 Indeed of this, sloth being the opposite, therefore, strength (is) in the world in my opinion altogether the best thing."
Grammar
1 Sounds and Writing
1.1 Writing System
The writing system of the Tocharian languages was not a wholly new creation, but an adaptation of a pre-existing script. The Tocharian scribes adopted a certain version of the north Indian Brāhmī script. This they subsequently modified to suit the requirements of their own language. A very small number of texts, however, are found in a Manichean script.

The Brahmi script is not purely alphabetic, nor purely syllabic. It is a system of so-called akṣaras. Each consonant has a separate, unique representation. The unmodified version, however, always represents the consonant followed by the default vowel a. Thus the symbol <p>, in the absence of other modifications, represents [pa] --- much as in English we write p, but say it is the letter 'pee'. But in English we would then have to write, say, the name Peter as p-ter, since we pronounce 'pee' whenever we see the symbol p.

To then tell the reader to pronounce the consonant with a different vowel, a certain symbol would be located above the <p> to denote [pi], a different symbol below to denote [pu], and so on. These symbols placed around the consonants to change the value of the following vowel are the bound forms of the vowels. Each vowel also had its own free form, generally used in word-initial position. The diphthongs ai and au had their own symbols, and were not written as the combination of their constituent elements.

The Indic languages are blessed with a wealth of stop consonants; the Tocharian languages, by contrast, lie impoverished in this regard. Tocharian thus had no need, in principle, to use symbols for the voiced aspirates such as gʰ, dʰ, bʰ; nor for the retroflex consonants such as ṭ, ḍ, ṇ. But this is not to say that Tocharian scribes did not employ them. The scribes were, in fact, often very faithful to the sounds and spellings of the Sanskrit words they borrowed. And as in other Buddhist traditions, so too the Tocharians borrowed a very large inventory of terminology directly from Sanskrit Buddhist texts. Thus the majority of Indic sounds have a graphical representation in some word or other in the Tocharian languages; but these are to be taken as the result of conservative tendencies in spelling and not necessarily as aids to the native Tocharian speaker in reproducing a faithful pronunciation -- much the same as our own tendency in English to keep the long silent gh of words like through.

Hard as it is to believe, there are in fact some sounds in Tocharian which are not to be found in Sanskrit. In particular, there is the voiceless dental affricate ts. This was in fact written by the Tocharians with a ligature of the characters representing t and s, but the sound itself is a single phoneme in Tocharian. Tocharian also possesses a reduced high central vowel denoted ä, since its representation in the Tocharian script involved the placements of two dots above the character for a. Take care to remember, however, that this is merely a convention of scholarly transcription, and it does not represent the German sound ä in words such as Mädchen. The phonetic value was probably closest to the IPA [ɨ].

One peculiar feature of Tocharian is that some vowels -- generally i, u, and ä -- could lose their syllabic content in open syllables. When this occurred, the Tocharian scribes would combine the preceding consonant with the following consonant, and write the non-syllabic vowel above the vowel which properly belonged to the following consonant. For example, phonemic /kuse/ was evidently pronounced with a reduced vowel as [kʷse], and this latter was represented in writing as <ksue>. Modern scholars generally transcribe this as kuse.

1.2 Phonological System
Relative to a language like Sanskrit, and even to Proto-Indo-European itself, the phonological system of Tocharian is quite simple. Both Tocharian languages have almost identical phonological systems. In particular, they have the same consonant inventory.

 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Alveolar	 	Palatal	 	Velar	 	Labiovelar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stop	 	p	 	t	 	 	 	 	 	k	 	kʷ
Affricate	 	 	 	ts	 	c	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sibilant	 	 	 	s	 	ṣ	 	ś	 	 	 	 
Nasal	 	m	 	n	 	 	 	ñ	 	ṅ	 	 
Liquid	 	 	 	l	 	r	 	 	 	 	 	 
Glide	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	y	 	 	 	w
The only voiced consonants are the resonants (liquids and nasals) and glides; all stops, affricates, and sibilants are voiceless. To what degree this classification is actually phonetic, and not merely phonemic, is difficult to say. For example, the stops of native Tocharian words are generally not written with the characters corresponding to the Sanskrit aspirates. But this is no guarantee that the stops themselves did not have some degree of aspiration, much like the p in English pot. We can only be relatively certain that the distinction between aspirate and non-aspirate was not important in Tocharian.

One important distinction is that between palatal and non-palatal consonants. As is clear in the chart, the Tocharian languages have a large palatal inventory, and the distinction between e.g. l and ly is phonemic. This alternation is largely a result of historical processes which will be discussed elsewhere in these lessons.

All consonants can be single (e.g. ṣ) or doubled (e.g. ṣṣ), possibly denoting a difference in consonant length. Compare, for example, the distinction between [n] in English pennant and [nn] in English penknife. Doubled consonants are rare, however, in Tocharian A. There is evidence that consonant doubling might not (always) denote consonant length: it appears that ll is a frequent spelling for the single palatal consonant ly. From this and other alternations, it seems likely that doubling consonants is a typical manner of denoting palatalization.

The two Tocharian languages have a common inventory of simple vowels. Their transcription and probable phonetic values are given in the chart below.

Transcription	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Phonetic Value	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Front	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	Back	 	 	 	Front	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	Back
High	 	i	 	 	 	ä	 	 	 	u	 	 	 	[i]	 	 	 	[ɨ]	 	 	 	[u]
Mid	 	 	 	e	 	a	 	o	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[e]	 	[ā́]	 	[o]	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	ā	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[a]	 	 	 	 
There is no certain evidence that the Tocharian languages had phonemic vocalic length. Rather, all vowels are phonemically short in both languages. It is important to note in this regard that the symbol ā is merely a convention of transcription -- it does not denote a long vowel, but rather an open, low, central unrounded vowel.

The phonetic value of ä is also poorly understood. Some evidence points to it being a front, mid vowel, though likely very weakly articulated. ä is often found where it is not etymologically expected, being the vowel generally employed to break up difficult consonant clusters.

By the time of the documented Tocharian languages, diphthongs remain only in Tocharian B.

 	 	Front	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	Back
High	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Mid	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	oy	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	ay, aw	 	 	 	 
The diphthongs are falling diphthongs formed the addition of one of the semivowels y or w. That is, the first vowel of the diphthong carries the syllabic content (and therefore can carry stress in a stressed syllable), while the second element changes the off-glide or release. The diphthongs written with the simple vowel e appear to have had the vocalism of a diphthong with nucleus a: one finds variations <ey> alternating with <ai>, <eu, eu, euw> alternating with au. Likewise <oi> alternates with oy. The diphthongs which existed in Proto-Tocharian were monophthongized in Tocharian A.

Some spellings indicate possible allophonic variation of consonants, that is, variation in the actual phonetic realization of a sound, but which nevertheless does not change the meaning of the form. Though the stops were generally voiceless in word-initial or word-final position, there is some evidence that stops were voiced in certain other environments. For example, the occasional writing of ṅ for ṅk suggests that -k was voiced to [g] in this position. It also seems stops were generally voiced between vowels, or after a consonant but before a vowel. Doubling of stop consonants evidently denotes a voiceless consonant which would otherwise have been voiced between vowels: for example, nätk- 'push' has present stem nättäk-, suggesting that the t remained voiceless between vowels. A summary of the possible allophones of the stop phonemes in various environments is given in the table below.

 	 	 	 	 	 	#_ or _#	 	 	 	 	 	V_V or C_V	 	 	 	 	 	N_
/p/	 	 	 	 	 	p	 	 	 	 	 	β	 	 	 	 	 	b
/t/	 	 	 	 	 	t	 	 	 	 	 	d	 	 	 	 	 	d
/k/	 	 	 	 	 	k	 	 	 	 	 	g	 	 	 	 	 	g
The character used for w seems at times to represent the voiced bilabial fricative [β]. The v of Sanskrit, which frequently had a fricative pronunciation, is typically rendered by Tocharian scribes as v, emulating Sanskrit spelling, or as w (e.g. aviś or awiś from Skt. avīci). As the table shows, Tocharian p seems also at times to represent [β]. This might explain such spelling alternations as B cpi for more usual cwi 'his'.

1.3 Rough Guide to Pronunciation
Given the preceding discussion, it is possible to estimate the actual phonetic value of the Tocharian sounds. These are given in the table below. These can only be approximate at best and are certainly open to revision as the Tocharian languages become better understood.

Transcription	 	Example	 	 	 	 	 	Transcription	 	Example
a	 	but	 	 	 	 	 	ḍʰ	 	--
ā	 	hot	 	 	 	 	 	ṇ	 	--
ä	 	bit	 	 	 	 	 	t	 	stop
i	 	beet	 	 	 	 	 	tʰ	 	top
u	 	boot	 	 	 	 	 	d	 	day
ṛ́	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	dʰ	 	--
e	 	bait	 	 	 	 	 	n	 	enough
ai	 	why	 	 	 	 	 	p	 	spot
o	 	boat	 	 	 	 	 	pʰ	 	pot
au	 	loud	 	 	 	 	 	b	 	boy
k	 	escape	 	 	 	 	 	bʰ	 	--
kʰ	 	cape	 	 	 	 	 	m	 	money
g	 	gate	 	 	 	 	 	y	 	yes
gʰ	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	r	 	rest
ṅ	 	long	 	 	 	 	 	l	 	late
c	 	watch	 	 	 	 	 	ly	 	William
cʰ	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	v	 	vibrate
j	 	jury	 	 	 	 	 	w	 	water
jʰ	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	ś	 	ship
ñ	 	onion	 	 	 	 	 	ṣ	 	wash
ṭ	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	s	 	seven
ṭʰ	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	ts	 	pots
ḍ	 	--	 	 	 	 	 	h	 	heart
The Tocharian letters are given in their dictionary order. This order is essentially the same as that of Sanskrit, with minor modifications.

It is not clear what pronunciation should be assigned to the Sanskrit sounds not contained in the Tocharian phonetic inventory (the lack of a clear approximation is denoted by "--" above). One possibile resolution is to remain faithful to the pronunciation of Classical Sanskrit. Given the changes, however, that some Sanskrit words undergo in their adoption by Tocharian speakers, this is not likely the manner in which any but the most learned Tocharian speakers pronounced these sounds. A more plausible scenario is that, though the writing may have remained faithful to the Sanskrit, the pronunciation was adapted to the available Tocharian phonological inventory.

The Sanskrit anusvāra is also employed in Tocharian writing. This is a raised dot placed over the syllable, representing in Sanskrit either a bilabial nasal (m) in word-final position, or a nasal homorganic with (having the same point of articulation as) the following consonant. As with Sanskrit, the anusvāra is transcribed as ṃ. In Tocharian, however, the majority of instances point to a single pronunciation as a dental nasal n.

1.4 Accent
The accent of words in Tocharian is complex and it is difficult to state a simple, overarching rule governing its placement. The vocalic alternations of Tocharian B lead scholars to believe that

the accent was on the second syllable in words of more than two syllables;
the accent was on the first syllable in words of two syllables.
This statement may not hold, however, for Tocharian A. It seems that if the second syllable contained a non-high vowel, the accent was retracted leftward.

Less is known about overall patterns of accent governing phrases and clauses. Particles generally lacked any sort of accent, and some evidence suggests that this may also be true for monosyllabic verb forms. It is unclear if the same is true for polysyllabic verb forms.

1.5 Palatalization
The phonetic development from Proto-Indo-European to the documented Tocharian languages involves various stages in which palatalization affected certain consonants. That is, due for example to a following vowel having an articulation with the blade of the tongue near the mouth's palate, the articulation of a preceding consonant might itself shift toward the palate. When different forms of the same word involve different vowels, some palatal and some not, this can lead to a concomitant alternation between palatalized and non-palatalized variants of the neighboring consonants. Such palatalizing processes occur both during and after the Proto-Tocharian period, and leave behind a system of somewhat regular correspondences between consonant phonemes in the daughter languages. The following chart lists the major correspondences between such palatalized and non-palatalized single consonants and clusters.

 	 	Non-Palatalized	 	Palatalized	 	Secondary
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stop	 	p	 	*p'	 	B py
 	 	t	 	c	 	 
 	 	k	 	ś	 	B ky

Nasal	 	nt	 	ñc (-ñś)	 	 
 	 	ṅk	 	A ñś B ñc	 	 
We will discuss palatalization further in the context of the historical phonology of the consonants.

2 Gender, Number, and Human/Non-Human
2.1 Gender
Tocharian maintains the three grammatical genders masculine, neuter, and feminine. As with many modern languages, these grammatical genders are distinct from the notion of biological gender, unless the particular noun represents something animate (in which case the grammatical and biological genders are often the same, but not always). Rather, grammatical gender serves as a marker for grammatical agreement, so that the listener knows that a noun and modifier (adjective) are associated if they both have, e.g., masculine grammatical gender. If they have differing genders, then the one does not modify the other. The Tocharian neuter grammatical gender however only survives as a separate category in the pronouns. This very much parallels the situation in modern Spanish. In that language nouns and adjectives show two grammatical genders (Sp. nouns el tablero m. 'the chalkboard' and la mesa f. 'the table'; adjectives bueno m. and buena f. 'good'). The pronouns by contrast show not only masculine (Sp. él 'he' or 'that (man who...)') and feminine (Sp. la 'she' or 'that (woman who...)'), but also a neuter (Sp. lo 'the (thing)' or 'that (thing which...)').

Among the nouns, the phonological changes in Tocharian led to the neuter endings converging with the masculine endings in the singular, and with the feminine endings in the plural, resulting in nouns which display a combination of the masculine and feminine endings. PIE masculine nouns of the type of Latin dolus (accusative dolum) merged in the singular with neuter nouns of the type of Latin donum (acc. donum), and also with neuter nouns of the type of Latin genus (acc. genus).

Singular	 	PIE	 	PToch.
Masculine	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*-o-s	 	*-æ
Accusative	 	*-o-m	 	*-æ
 	 	 	 	 
Neuter	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*-o-m, *-os-Ø	 	*-æ
Accusative	 	*-o-m, *-os-Ø	 	*-æ
By contrast, in the plural the PIE neuter ending *-H₂ fell together in PToch. with the feminine plural suffix *-H₂-es.

Plural	 	PIE	 	PToch.
Feminine	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*-H₂-es	 	*-ā
Accusative	 	*-H₂-es	 	*-ā
 	 	 	 	 
Neuter	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā
Accusative	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā
Such nouns, with masculine endings in the singular and feminine endings in the plural, are said to have alternating gender.

2.2 Number
Tocharian has kept the PIE categories of singular (one of a thing), dual (two of a thing), and plural (more than two of a thing). It has also innovated in creating the paral, which is a sort of dual used to denote naturally occurring pairs, e.g. (two) hands, (two) eyes. The forms derive from the original inherited dual of PIE, with the additional suffix *-nō. For example, A aśäṃ, B eśane 'both eyes'. Tocharian B has a further innovation called the plurative, which employs the ending -aiwenta (from the plural of PIE *oi-wo- 'one') to express 'one at a time, individually'.

2.3 Human versus Non-Human
In the earliest stages of Proto-Indo-European there appears to have been a basic distinction between animate and inanimate among the substantives. That is, substantives denoting animate beings shared one type of morphology, characterized in part by the fact that the nominative ending differed from the accusative. By contrast, substantives denoting inanimate things shared a different type of morphology, generally characterized by the fact that the nominative and accusative forms were identical.

By the time of the documented languages, however, this system was almost everywhere restructured into a ternary system of masculine, feminine, and neuter genders -- Hittite being the most notable exception. These genders were grammatical, in the sense that, for example, not all nouns denoting males had masculine endings. The Latin noun nauta 'sailor' furnishes a ready example, taking the feminine ending -a even though generally denoting a male.

The Tocharian languages show a different restructuring. Though there are, as mentioned elsewhere, still clear remnants of the three-way gender distinction of the majority of the IE family, Tocharian noun classification shows another overarching structure. Tocharian consistently distinguishes substantival morphology on the basis of whether a noun is human or non-human. Most succinctly,

human nouns have oblique singular -ṃ, i.e. /n/;
non-human nouns do not.
Thus 'dog', though animate, will not take the oblique singular ending -ṃ, since it is not human. This ending has not only morphological value, but semantic value as well.

3 Adjective Overview
Adjectives display two genders, masculine or feminine, unless they are used as substantives (see below). Substantives with masculine grammatical gender take the masculine adjective endings, feminine substantives take the feminine endings. There is a special class of nouns, however, that takes masculine adjective endings in the singular and feminine adjective endings in the plural. These substantives are those with the so-called alternating grammatical gender.

An adjective may be used as a neuter substantive, parallel to the process in English whereby good becomes the good (thing) -- e.g. You have to take the good with the bad -- or even more akin to how Spanish bueno becomes lo bueno. The Tocharian neuter substantive is for the most part formally indistinguishable from the masculine, a natural result of the collapse of the PIE masculine and neuter into identical forms. The only difference in Tocharian is that the new substantive now, like any PIE neuter, has identical nominative and oblique (old accusative). Thus what was the masculine nominative form is in this substantive now the nominative and oblique. Such neuter substantives are only found in the singular.

4 Overview of the Verbal System
4.1 Person & Number
Tocharian verbs, as with the majority of the Indo-European languages, distinguish three persons: first ('I, we'), second ('you/thou, you (all)'), and third ('he, she, it, they') person. The first person refers to the speaker, perhaps with companions. The second person refers to the addressee. The third person refers to participants or referents outside of the first and second person.

Tocharian verbs further distinguish three numbers: singular, dual, and plural. The singular and plural distinguish between one and more-than-one; the dual specifically signifies two. There is no complete verbal paradigm with dual forms for all persons; the dual is a highly restricted verbal category, usually occurring in the third person (e.g. B nesteṃ 'they two are'), and whose forms have no sure connection to the dual forms of Proto-Indo-European itself. Thus, in general, Tocharian verbs distiguish singular from plural: B nesau 'I am' vs. nesem 'we are'; B nest 'thou art' vs. nescer 'you (all) are'; B nesäṃ 'he/she/it is' vs. nesäṃ 'they are'.

4.2 Voice
In a concrete sense, the distinction of voice is found in the contrast of the two English sentences 'The dog bit the man' and 'The man was bitten by the dog'. In the former, the dog is the grammatical subject, and also the one doing the action of biting. In the latter, the man is now the grammatical subject, though the dog is still doing the action of biting. We say the sentence 'The dog bit the man' is active, because the grammatical subject (the dog) is also the agent (the one doing the action). The second sentence, 'The man was bitten by the dog', is passive, because the agent is not the grammatical subject; instead, the patient (the one being acted upon) is instead the grammatical subject. Active and passive are two types of voice.

There is a third voice relevant to many Indo-European languages, one which is neither active nor passive, but combines some connotations of both. For this reason it is known as the middle voice, or, because especially in Greek the passive and middle forms largely overlap, as the mediopassive. In order to get some idea of how this functions, consider the following English example sentences:

1a. 'The man soaked the towel in the bathtub';
1b. 'The towel was soaked by the man in the bathtub';
1c. 'The man soaked himself in the bathtub'.
Sentence (1a) is clearly active: the grammatical subject, the man, is also the agent (the one doing the soaking). Sentence (1b) is clearly passive: the grammatical subject, the towel, is not the agent but the patient (the one receiving the action). In sentence (1c), however, the grammatical subject is the agent (the man is doing the soaking) and also the patient (the man is also the one getting soaked). We say that sentence (1c) is middle or mediopassive.

In the example above, sentence (1c) is mediopassive by virtue of the fact that it is reflexive. That is, by explicit use of the word himself, we have equated the agent and patient. However, this is not always necessary:

2a. 'The towel soaked the paper underneath';
2b. 'The towel was soaked by the man in the bathtub';
2c. 'The towel soaked in the bathtub'.
In sentence (2a) the towel is the agent and subject of the active sentence; in sentence (2b), the towel is the patient and subject of a passive sentence. And in sentence (2c) the towel is the subject, agent and patient, this time not by virtue of the insertion of a reflexive pronoun, but by something the English verb soak allows.

The sentence (2c) is not very different in sense from sentence (2b) if we delete the agentive phrase by the man. It may therefore come as no surprise to find that many languages which morphologically mark passive and middle verb forms often use the same forms for both. Classical Greek falls into this category, so that pʰérō 'I carry' is active, while pʰéromai is both middle ('I carry for myself') and passive ('I am carried'). Some middle and passive forms do nevertheless differ: lūsámenos (masc. nom. sg.) 'having freed (for himself)' is the aorist middle participle, while lūtʰeís (masc. nom. sg.) 'having been freed' is the aorist passive participle.

Some languages, furthermore, do away with a separate passive formation altogether, and simply make do with a basic distinction between active and middle. Tocharian falls into this class of languages. There is no morphological passive; when passive statements are intended, middle forms are used. This may in fact be a late development, a usage borrowed on the model of Sanskrit. In short, Tocharian has only a morphological active and mediopassive, with no separate morphological forms that are strictly passive.

Some verbs are (middle) deponents, that is, verbs which occur with exclusively middle forms. For example, all finite forms of AB trik- 'be confused' are middle: A trikatär B triketär 'is confused', where -tär is the 3rd person singular middle ending; forms with the active endings A -ṣ B -ṃ do not occur. Some such deponents occasionally have an active present participle form, e.g. trik- forms the present participle A trikant. But it must be kept in mind that, although this suffix derives from PIE *-o-nt-, which comes to be the active present participle in such languages as Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, nevertheless:

the A -nt B -nta / -ñca formations are not participles necessarily derived directly from the synchronic present stem, but often function more as agent nouns than participles;
the PIE *-ent- / -ont- formation may have functioned as an agent noun in the earliest stages of PIE.
Thus it may not even be proper to denote such forms as 'active' participles. For example, the root AB pik- 'paint', related to Latin pingere with the same meaning, forms A pekant. Rather than having the connotation of the Latin present participle pingens (-ntis) '(someone) painting (at the moment)', the Tocharian form pekant has the connotation of 'someone who paints by profession', i.e. a 'painter', akin to the Latin agent noun pictor.

4.3 Mood
Tocharian distinguishes four basic moods: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative. The indicative is the mood of simple fact, as in the English 'He was an athelete'. The indicative mood has both present and past tense formations in Tocharian. The subjunctive is the mood of hypothesis or supposition, as in the English 'If he were an athelete...' or 'Were he an athelete...'. Tocharian subjunctive forms do not differ based on tense; the subjunctive stem differs from the present tense stem, but nevertheless employs the same endings. Tocharian often uses the subjunctive where English would use a future tense. The optative is the mood of wish or desire, as in English 'Would he were an athelete'. This is formed by adding the typical PIE optative marker, *-i-, to the subjunctive stem. The imperative is the mood of direct command, as in English 'Be an athelete!' The imperative in Tocharian has no distinct stem, but is formed by addition of the prefix p- to the preterite or subjunctive stem. There are special endings for the 2nd person only, all numbers.

4.4 Tense
Tocharian distinguishes between past and present tenses only in the indicative. There are two past tenses: imperfect and preterite. The distinction is basically one of verbal aspect. The preterite denotes a simple past, with no connotation of an internal structure to the action; compare English 'he went'. The imperfect, by contrast, denotes an ongoing past, with the expressed connotation of the event having internal structure; compare English 'he was going'.

There is no separate morphological future tense in Tocharian. Though the present can be used to express the future, as in English 'I am going to the store tomorrow', the Tocharian subjunctive frequently acts as a future tense. Tocharian also employs verbal nouns to render the future tense.

4.5 Base & Causative
One of the most fundamental distinctions in the Tocharian verbal system is that between base and causative. In linguistic terms, the notion of causative, or factitive, has to do with 'making' or 'causing' another verbal action to be done. That is, if we have a verb DO Y, then the causative of the verb denotes MAKE [(X) DO Y] or CAUSE [(X) TO DO Y]. Thus the causative construction applied to English 'paints a picture' is 'someone makes [(someone else) paint a picture]'. The underlying verb need not be eventive (e.g. DO Y), but may also be stative (e.g. BE Y). The causative construct then denotes MAKE [(X) BE Y]. Different languages realize this underlying formation differently, some through concatenation of lexical verbs as in English, some though separate morphological formations; or both, or neither. Consider, for example, English 'I am captain'. By the formulation just given, the basic causative rendering might be 'He makes me be captain'. English of course simplifies this to 'He makes me captain'. Thus the stative be captain has causative make captain.

Note that neither does English have one unique manner of forming this kind of causative. If we apply the same construction to the stative be strong, then we arrive at a causative make strong. But English has an alternate formation: strengthen. This of course applies only to certain adjectives, e.g. lengthen, widen, shorten, heighten; one cannot however say (!)closen, but rather one can only say make close. This disparity arises because rules that were once regular in the period of Old English no longer apply synchronically in Modern English. A similar situation obtains in Tocharian.

Tocharian achieves this distinction by changes to the verbal stem, giving rise to a distinction between a causative stem and a non-causative, or base, stem for a large number of verbs. The distinction between causative and non-causative runs throughout the present, subjunctive, and preterite systems; the base and causative stems of a given verb, however, are not the same throughout these systems. For example, consider the verb AB tsälp- 'be free of suffering, pass away'.

Present	 	Toch. A	 	Toch. B
Base	 	śalpatär	 	tsälpetär
Causative	 	tsälpäṣtär	 	tsalpäṣtär
 	 	 	 	 
Subjunctive	 	 	 	 
Base	 	tsälpātär	 	tsälpātär
Causative	 	tsälpāṣtär	 	tsalpästär
 	 	 	 	 
Preterite	 	 	 	 
Base	 	tsälp	 	tsalpa
Causative	 	śaśälpāt	 	tsyālpāte
The preterite forms show that one method of forming the causative in Tocharian involves reduplication: A tsälp vs. śaśälpāt. The initial consonant sequence and vowel of the root (subject to phonological modifications) are repeated at the beginning of the word. Another mark of the causative form is palatalization: B tsalpa vs. tsyālpāte. The initial consonant may develop a palatal off-glide.

The other forms, however, show traces of a more common method of forming the causative in Tocharian: addition of the PIE *-sḱ- and *-s- suffixes. These suffixes of course undergo phonological changes within the Tocharian languages. Tocharian A generally employs only the *-s- suffix, which often palatalizes into -ṣ-. Tocharian B employs both suffixes: *-sḱ- palatalizes as -ṣṣ- in CLASS IX, and *-s- as -ṣ- in CLASS VIII (cf. Lesson 4, Sections 19.3 and 19.4). For its part, the PIE *-sḱ- suffix does not have a causative meaning in many of the other Indo-European languages in which it survives, but often has either an inchoative or iterative connotation.

The Tocharian situation is also not as clear cut as one might hope. One must in fact be careful to distinguish between 'causative' as a purely formal morphological category and 'causative' as an actual semantic category. The above mentioned structures clearly show a formal morphological formation which we may call 'causative' because it does, in fact, have a true factitative meaning for many verbs. However this is not true for all verbs: many verbs have the structural markings of the causative formation, but show no apparent change in meaning distinct from the non-causative (base) formations. In general, one may only say that

 	 	the 'causative' has true factitative value only when the base paradigm has intransitive value.
That is to say, there are two basic possibilties as to how the base is converted into a causative:

Base Intransitive: the causative morphological formation has factitative meaning;
Base Transitive: the causative morphological formation might not have meaning different from the base.
5 Basic Word Order
The prose texts of Tocharian exhibit a basic Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order. The constraints of meter, among other considerations, often result in divergence from this pattern in poetry. Consider the following examples of the basic SOV word order:

A	 	kāsu	 	ñom-klyu	 	tsraṣiśśi	 	śäk	 	kälymentwaṃ	 	sätkatär
 	 	nom.sg.m.	 	nom.sg.m.	 	gen.pl.m.	 	indecl.	 	loc.pl.mf.	 	pres.3.sg.med-pass.
 	 	good	 	fame	 	of-strong	 	ten	 	in-directions	 	spreads
which means

 	 	'The good fame of the strong spreads in the ten directions'.
From Tocharian B we have

B	 	cauw-ak	 	yakne	 	eṅkaskemttär	 	mäkcau	 	procer	 	eṅsate
 	 	obl.sg.m.-pcl.	 	obl.sg.m.	 	pres.1.pl.	 	obl.sg.m.	 	nom.sg.m.	 	pres.3.sg.med-pass.
 	 	same	 	manner	 	we-take-up	 	which	 	brother	 	takes
which means

 	 	'We take up the same manner which (our) brother takes'.
Phrasal structure generally shows the following patterns: Adjective + Noun, Genitive + Noun, Noun + Postposition, the term 'postposition' denoting a 'preposition' that comes after the noun it governs. In general, the structure within Proto-Tocharian was one of Modifier + Head, where 'head' denotes the principal element on which all others in the phrase depend.

Speaking typologically, languages with verb-final syntax tend to employ postpositions rather than prepositions. This tendency is further exhibited in Tocharian through the development of the secondary cases, whose endings apparently began as postpositions. This postpositional quality is still felt strongly enough in Tocharian that it results in "group inflection", whereby only the last element in a string of nouns, or in a string composed of a noun with adjectives, takes the secondary case ending.

Laryngeals
Since voiceless aspirates were finally removed from the PIE stop inventory, scholars were forced to explain the origin of the voiceless aspirates in Sanskrit. For this Hittite again led the way. Hittite preserved consonants, now called laryngeals and denoted *h₁, *h₂, *h₃ (or collectively just *H), which were unattested in any of the other daughter languages. These consonants, when following voiceless non-aspirates in Sanskrit, resulted in the corresponding aspirate: PIE *-tH- > Skt. -tʰ-. Laryngeals also had the following effects:

Coloring: laryngeals change the quality, or "color," of an adjacent PIE short *e;
Contraction: laryngeals contract with a preceding vowel to give a long vowel of the same quality;
Vocalization: a laryngeal between consonants yields a vowel.
The following chart illustrates Laryngeal coloring.

Color	 	PIE	 	Result	 	PIE	 	Result
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
e	 	*h₁e	 	*h₁e	 	*eh₁	 	*eh₁
a	 	*h₂e	 	*h₂a	 	*eh₂	 	*ah₂
o	 	*h₃e	 	*h₃o	 	*eh₃	 	*oh₃
The chart below shows the laryngeal contraction that follows coloring.

PIE	 	Color	 	Contraction
 	 	 	 	 
*eh₁	 	*eh₁	 	*ē
*eh₂	 	*ah₂	 	*ā
*eh₃	 	*oh₃	 	*ō
The vocalization of laryngeals differed according to language, as shown in the following chart.

PIE	 	Greek	 	Latin	 	Sanskrit
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dʰh₁s-	 	tʰés-pʰatos	 	fānum < fas-no-	 	dʰiṣ-ṇya-
*sth₂-tó-	 	sta-tó-s	 	sta-tu-s	 	stʰi-ta-
*dh₃-ti-	 	dó-si-s	 	da-tiō	 	di-ti-
After coloring and contraction, the laryngeals themselves were subsequently lost in all languages except Hittite. The following chart compares the outcomes of some PIE roots in Hittite and Latin.

PIE	 	Coloring	 	Hittite	 	Latin
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*h₁es-ti	 	*h₁es-ti	 	ēš-zi 'is'	 	est 'is'
*h₂ent-	 	*h₂ant-	 	hant- 'forehead'	 	ante 'before'
*h₃erbʰ-	 	*h₃orbʰ-	 	harapp- 'be separated'	 	orbus 'orphan'
The table below gives some typical examples of the sequence of changes leading from PIE forms containing laryngeals to their remnants in other daughter languages.

PIE	 	Color	 	Contraction	 	Result
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dʰeh₁-mṇ	 	*dʰeh₁-mṇ	 	*dʰē-mṇ	 	Gk. (aná)-tʰēma
*peh₂-s-	 	*pah₂-s-	 	*pā-s-	 	Lat. pās-tor
*deh₃-rom	 	*doh₃-rom	 	*dō-rom	 	Gk. dō-ron
Vowels
As with the PIE stop inventory, the PIE vocalic system was originally assumed to be quite robust. The original assumption was that it contained all the "continental" vowels -- *a, *e, *i, *o, *u -- together with their lengthened counterparts -- *ā, *ē, *ī, *ō, *ū. Upon further investigation, it was found that the evidence for PIE *a is in fact sparse. The advent of laryngeal theory in turn allowed for even greater simplification, since both PIE *a and *o could be assumed to derive from earlier PIE *eh₂ and *eh₃, respectively. The lengthened vowels could likewise be derived from laryngeal contraction. Thus the PIE vowel system seemed to devolve into merely *e plus the semivowels *i and *u. This position seems so extreme, however -- there are no extant languages with solely one vowel -- that most historical linguists take the core PIE vowels to be *e, *a, *o (the latter two being rarer than the first), plus the semivowels *i, *u. The lengthened grades are typically seen as the result of laryngeal contraction, though there does seem to be evidence from patterns of vocalic alternation (ablaut) that some long vowels were original in PIE.

Resonants
The resonants of PIE are the typical *r, *l, *n, *m. Each of these can function as consonant, beginning or ending a syllable, or as forming the nucleus of a syllable, like a vowel. In the latter role they are often denoted *ṛ, *ḷ, *ṇ, *ṃ. As an example, compare the first l- of the English word little, which as a consonant begins the first syllable, to the second -l-, which as a vowel forms the nucleus of the second syllable.

Given the ability of the laryngeals to vocalize between consonants, it is occasionally convenient to think of the laryngeals likewise as resonants.

Affricates
PIE had the sole sibilant *s. In certain environments this may have become voiced, but this was an allophonic change, not phonemic.

Proto-Indo-European Phonology: a Summary
The basic idea of PIE phonology is to posit a phonological system of the parent language Proto-Indo-European, and to state explicitly different groups of rules, whereby the phonemes of PIE changed regularly into those of the various daughter languages. For instance, one set of rules should say how those phonemes changed into the phonemic inventory of Proto-Germanic; another should describe how the PIE phonemes changed into those of Proto-Italic; and so on. From there, one repeats the procedure, e.g. stating rules by which the phonemes of Proto-Italic developed into those of Latin. The Tocharianist of course desires to apply the same methodology to Tocharian A and B, first deciding how PIE phonemes became those of Proto-Tocharian, and how these latter became the phonemes seen in Tocharian A and Tocharian B themselves.

Lest the reader receive the impression that this is in some sense a merely linguistic pursuit devoid of application to matters of Tocharian society and culture, consider the following. In the early period of Tocharian studies, it was not clear what relative status to give to the two languages Tocharian A and Tocharian B. Scholars were not clear as to whether they are mere dialects, two separate languages in their own right, or if one is the linguistic ancestor of the other. It is primarily through studies of phonology that one attempts to decide the question: for the most part is has become clear that the two languages have phonological rules distinct enough that it is difficult to say one derives from the other. And in many instances it is quite difficult to imagine that they were mutually intelligible at the time they were spoken. (However assertions of this sort are notoriously dubious, since there are ancient references that Old English and Old Norse were mutually intelligible, something that rarely occurs to modern scholars as they attempt to learn the two languages.) At present there is general concensus that Tocharian A and Tocharian B are in fact two distinct languages, likely spoken concurrently by different groups of speakers. This conclusion must be taken into account, then, when one discusses the curious fact that the Tocharian A documents found thus far are all translations of foreign Buddhist literature, while Tocharian B shows at least some documents of native Tocharian composition. If one were to look at a similar situation in the present day, noting that Latin is used almost solely as a liturgical language, while Italian has a robust native literature, one might surmise that as Italian descends from Latin, so must Tocharian B from Tocharian A. But this is not borne out by linguistic inquiry. One must ask then what societal conditions would lead to the Tocharian A speakers writing solely liturgical documents, while Tocharian B speakers left documents on a much wider variety of matters of daily life?

Moreover, in terms of scientific inquiry, laryngeal theory has provided the greatest historical linguistic instance of scientific prediction. Saussure in essence developed the initial idea of laryngeals as a means to explain certain irregularities in Sanskrit root formations: in particular, some roots take a linking -i- between root and suffix, while others do not, without any obvious underlying pattern. Saussure hypothesized that if there were PIE consonants obeying certain rules, then these consonants would explain the resultant situation in Sanskrit. This theory actually preceded the discovery of Hittite, and so such consonants were relegated at the time to the status of mere formal speculation. But with the subsequent decipherment of Hittite, scholars realized that Hittite preserved Saussure's hitherto unattested consonants!

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following text is a continuation of the previous Tocharian A excerpt from the Buddhist Puṇyavanta-Jātaka.

Note the use in verse 20 of näṃ, a shortened form for naṣ-äṃ, the third person singular present of the copula, followed by the enclitic pronoun, here 'is for them'. Such constructions with copula and pronoun are common ways of representing possession in Indo-European languages, for example Lat. mihi nōmen est... 'to me is the name...', i.e. 'I have the name...'.

Verse 21 is somewhat problematic, with scholarly opinion divided as to whether one should read kälpitär 'should attain (for oneself)' or käl(y)itär 'should exist'. The form amok 'skill' is unfortunately of no help, being the same in nominative and oblique. The reading kälpitär is presented in the selection given below, following the text of Krause & Thomas (Tocharisches Elementarbuch). The translation however gives the rendering according to Lane, and so appropriate to a reading käl(y)itär. See the grammatical notes accompanying the gloss for more details.

The reading selection illustrates in verse 22 the typical Indo-European use of the neuter accusative of an adjective in the role of an adverb, here kāsu 'carefully'. Since masculine and neuter have fallen together in Tocharian, this neuter accusative adverb has form identical with the nominative singular masculine.

Translation
15 Shilpavant says: "Skill of men is altogether the best (thing); for (in kuma...-meter):
16 The good fame of the artisan spreads in all directions.
He is to be treated with reverence, (is) to be respected, to be received by men.
17 Guarded property is to be made vanish; water, fire, kings (and) thieves cut off (one's) resources.
But skill does not vanish, and of property skill (is) the root.
18 "And (in just the same measure) as an artist an artistic object creates, (just) so the five advantages are for him. 19 One advantage, having done the thing, arises for him; a second (is that) having created out of skill (there) is a (sense of) pleasure in him(?); a third (is that) he acquires glory(?) from men; a fourth (is that he acquires) pupils; and a fifth is for him the advantage of possession or acquisition. 20 Of establishing a house and of the divine world the root being skill, therefore this of (=by) the great teachers has been said (in shurishin-meter):
21 "First skill should exist, then one should collect property,
But collected property indeed one should make (into) four part(s):
22 One part one should enjoy at home; with two (parts) one should perform works.
Later, having seen distress, the fourth one should put carefully (away).
23 "One work (is) water for the earth; the second, cattle to be pastured; the third trade;
The fourth, however, rearing cattle; the fifth... ; the sixth putting (away) (?).
24 In establishing a house, whoever, having provided these six things,
gathers property by parts in five ways, of him the work goes aright.
25 "Thus collecting, possessions by day and by night thrive.
So -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- or having wiped away (?).
26 For an old (man) property (is) not to be laid up, not for those who are over the land (?),
Not for the terrible, the evil, and not for the powerful.
27 "A thing to be done one should always do; a thing not to be done one should not do.
(In) doing a thing to be done one appears (as) a flaming fire.
28 Through one's relatives, through glories (?) -- -- -- having received at birth (and) death (?).
Always among relatives he bellows like a bull, confidently.
29 "Having given a gift (and) received (one), as (is) fitting, (a man is) like (i.e. equal) to all.
If a man go in the direction of death,
He should reach the place of the gods by prospering without blame.
30 Therefore skill, in my opinion, (is) altogether the best (quality) of men."
Grammar
6 Sandhi
As with most languages, Tocharian sounds at the moment of utterance are subject to rules of euphonic combination, also known by the Sanskrit term sandhi. The idea is simply that a given sound may change in any given utterance according to the particular phonetic environment in which it occurs. During the pronunciation of a given sound, the mouth may already be preparing itself for the following sound, and hence may change the sound under consideration; or the mouth may still be at the point of articulation of the previous sound, and this may affect the sound under consideration. This process commonly occurs in English, for example when the final voiced labio-dental fricative [v] of have [hæv] becomes the unvoiced counterpart [f] in the phrase I have to go -- more phonetically, I hafta go. This is a result of the mouth already preparing to say the following unvoiced t while still pronouncing the last consonant of have -- the [v] is devoiced to [f] as a result of this anticipation.

Such changes are generally very regular within a particular language. Sanskrit is perhaps the pinnacle of this, where the changes appear to have been grammaticalized after a time (certain rules of sandhi were less regular in the Vedic period than in the Classical period). While the Tocharian system is not nearly as ornate as the system of Classical Sanskrit, it does obey certain regularities of its own. These are frequently applied in the context of poetry where the number of syllables is essential to the meter. Outside of the poetic context, such euphonic combination is less frequently applied.

Generally the final vowels i, e, u, o are changed to their nearest equivalent semivowel before a following vowel. The syllabic resonants, that is the liquids and nasals reinforced by the epenthetic vowel ä -- är, äl, än -- become their fully consonantal equivalents.

Semivowel Examples	 	Before Sandhi	 	After Sandhi
 	 	 	 	 
-i > -y	 	A ñi anapär	 	ñy anapär
-e > -y	 	A sne āñu	 	sny āñu
 	 	 	 	 
-u > -w	 	B su eru	 	sw eru
-o > -w	 	B po akālkänta	 	pw akālkänta
 	 	 	 	 
-är > -r	 	A āṣtär akmalṣi	 	āṣtr akmalṣi
-äl > -l	 	B eṅkäl aknātsaññe	 	eṅkl aknātsaññe
-än > -n	 	A poñcäṃ ārkiśoṣṣis	 	poñcn ārkiśoṣṣis
Some of the rules, however, do not apply equally or in all instances in both languages. For example, the change -e > -y is rare in Tocharian B, the -e generally contracting with the following vowel in this language. The change -o > -w is often accompanied by the change a- > ā- in Tocharian B: nano alyek > nanw ālyek.

Two vowels of the same basic type generally contract to the respective simple vowel.

Like-Vowel Examples	 	Before Sandhi	 	After Sandhi
 	 	 	 	 
a + a > a, ā	 	B āsta arkwina	 	āst=arkwina
a + ā > ā	 	A śla āñcālyi	 	śl=āñcālyi
ā + a, ā > ā	 	A mā appärmāt	 	mā=pärmāt
 	 	 	 	 
i + i > i	 	A āñmaṣi ime	 	āñmaṣ=ime
e + e > e	 	B te epiṅkte	 	t=epiṅkte
 	 	 	 	 
o + o > o	 	A wiyo oki	 	wiy=oki
When the following vowel is dissimilar from the preceding vowel, the preceding vowel generally disappears if it does not become a semivowel according to the previous discussion. A notable exception to this is o, which has various differing results when it does not change to the semivowel -w. These results are summarized in the following table.

Unlike-Vowel Examples	 	Before Sandhi	 	After Sandhi
 	 	 	 	 
a + i > i, a	 	B warsa ite	 	wars=ite
a + e > a, e	 	B -mpa eṣe	 	-mp=eṣe

o + e > o	 	B yärpo entwe	 	yärpo=ntwe
o + ai > oy	 	B po aiśeñcai	 	po=yśeñcai
Consonant sandhi is less widespread than its vocalic counterpart. In general, final consonants may assimilate to the point of articulation of the following initial consonant, so that for example a dental consonant may become palatal before a following palatal.

Initial-Consonant Examples	 	Before Sandhi	 	After Sandhi
 	 	 	 	 
Dental	 	B täñ no	 	tän no
 	 	 	 	 
Palatal	 	A ālakäṃ caṃ	 	ālakäñ caṃ
 	 	B śaul ñi	 	śauly ñi
 	 	 	 	 
Velar	 	B postäṃ ka	 	postäṅ ka
In addition, one finds that a final consonant is occasionally doubled before a following initial vowel. In Tocharian A this generally occurs before enclitics. The complementary process is also seen, where an initial consonant is doubled after a preceding final vowel. See the following chart.

Consonant-Doubling Examples	 	Before Sandhi	 	After Sandhi
 	 	 	 	 
C + V > CC + V	 	A tmäṣ aci	 	tmäṣṣ aci
 	 	B poñ āppai	 	poññ āppai
 	 	 	 	 
V + C > V + CC	 	B entwe ka	 	entwe kka
 	 	B welñenta ceṃts	 	welñenta cceṃts
7 Case
Case, more specifically morphological case, signifies the mechanism whereby changes to the ending of a noun, adjective, or pronoun serve to denote its grammatical role in a particular utterance. This survives in a relatively small way in modern English, particularly with the addition of 's to denote the genitive singular, or s' to denote the genitive plural, or s to denote nominative or oblique plural. Here the terms nominative, genitive, and oblique are all names of cases in modern English. Some, like the nominative and genitive, still largely carry the form and/or function of their historical predecessors in Proto-Indo-European; the other, the oblique, by contrast is an amalgam of historically distinct cases whose forms merged to give the modern representative. Much the same state of affairs holds in the Tocharian languages.

Speaking loosely, the nominative is the case of the grammatical subject of a clause, or of something equated with the subject. Thus English she is nominative, since this is the form of the feminine pronoun which one uses for the grammatical subject: she walked home yesterday. The genitive is often explained as the "possessive case", since this is a common function represented by the marker 's and s' in English, but this is a great oversimplification. The case denotes very general relationship or qualification. Consider the relations denoted by 's in the following phrases:

Lincoln's presidency;
gold's luster;
Lincoln's assassination;
Booth's assassination;
Lincoln's top hat.
The first and second show what many would call "possession," but this is usually for lack of a better term, since 'presidency' and 'luster' are not commodities one can buy at the local store. The third denotes the object of the action represented by assassination, the fourth denotes the subject. Only the last actually denotes possession. The oblique denotes in English the object of a verb or preposition, such as me in the following sentences: He hit me; He gave me the book; He gave the book to me.

Proto-Indo-European possessed a much more robust case system than that of modern English. PIE, by most reconstructions, had eight cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative. These cases survived intact only in the earliest exemplars of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European family; in other families, the forms of different cases fell away and their roles were adopted by the forms of other cases, perhaps aided by the use of prepositions or postpositions (compare English me and to me above). This same process occurred within the history of the Tocharian languages, so that only three of the original PIE cases survived as morphological entities in Tocharian. However the use to postpositions in conjunction with one of these cases became so widespread that it appears to have led to the generation of new cases, different in form -- and sometimes in function -- from the original PIE cases. In this way Tocharian developed a two-tiered case system, the remnants of the PIE cases being called primary, and the newly developed cases called secondary.

7.1 Primary Cases
Tocharian retains only three of the original Indo-European cases: the nominative, genitive, and accusative, this last generally called the oblique case in the literature because it forms the basis for the secondary cases discussed below. Tocharian B additionally retains a vocative case. The nominative has generally undergone numerous changes which obscure the relation between the Tocharian endings and the original Indo-European endings, and even when the oblique shows some of its original PIE color, terminating in a nasal, this turns out to be a false friend -- since final consonants other than liquids and the voiced dental stop were generally lost in the earliest stages of the Tocharian language family, the nasal element of many oblique endings must in fact come from a PIE suffix preceding the ending, and not the ending itself. This is a large clue to the origin of many Tocharian nominal patterns lying with the extension of the original PIE n-stems. The genitive shows a variety of endings, which at times go back to PIE genitive endings, but possibly also to dative endings. This latter possibility is bolstered by the fact that the Tocharian genitive case often serves many of the roles of the PIE dative case.

The following chart shows the original PIE cases and their survival in the primary cases of Tocharian.

PIE Case	 	Function	 	English Example	 	Survives in Tocharian
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	subject	 	she sees him	 	Nominative
Accusative	 	direct object	 	she sees him	 	Oblique
 	 	directed motion	 	she throws it across the room	 	 
Instrumental	 	thing by means of which	 	she sees him with her eyes	 	 
 	 	accompaniment	 	she is going with him	 	 
Dative	 	indirect object	 	she give a book to him	 	Genitive
Ablative	 	source	 	she comes from New York	 	 
Genitive	 	relation	 	her look was enchanting	 	Genitive
 	 	possession	 	her car was red	 	 
Locative	 	stationary position	 	she called me at home	 	 
Vocative	 	direct address	 	O, my Lord!	 	Vocative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The blank spaces in the rightmost column indicate that the given PIE case did not survive in the primary cases of Tocharian. Most of the functions however are taken up in the secondary case system, to be described later.

7.1.1 Declension Types

Due to the large number of phonological changes between Proto-Indo-European and the Tocharian languages, the original PIE declensional types have undergone a heavy restructuring. The result is a large degree of variation between declensional classes. But across the board, Tocharian nouns fall into two broad types based on the formation of the plural:

Type (a)	 	nominative plural	 	 	 	 	 	different from	 	 	 	 	 	oblique plural;
Type (b)	 	nominative plural	 	 	 	 	 	same as	 	 	 	 	 	oblique plural.
Given these two basic types, some further tendencies may be pointed out. In both languages, nouns of Type (a) generally have singular forms which differ in the nominative and accusative. Likewise, Type (b) nouns generally have singular nominative and oblique forms which are the same. Thus we have the following tendencies:

i.	 	nom. pl. different from obl. pl.	 	 	 	 	 	==>	 	 	 	 	 	nom. sg. different from obl. sg.
ii.	 	nom. pl. same as obl. pl.	 	 	 	 	 	==>	 	 	 	 	 	nom. sg. same as obl. sg.
But this certainly does not always hold true.

7.1.2 Primary Case Endings

The singular nominative and oblique in both Tocharian A and B lack an explicit ending. Human nouns provide the exception, where the oblique singular is marked by -ṃ. This lack of an overt marker led in Tocharian A to a nearly uniform equivalence of nominative and oblique forms. In Tocharian B, stem alternations prevented this equivalence, except when the nouns derived from original PIE *o-stem masculines and from PIE neuters.

The genitive singular shows AB -i, the reflex of the PIE dative, in nouns denoting kinship and proper names. In other situations, the genitive singular generally shows A -ys B -ntse, reflexes of PToch. *-nse.

The vocative only survives in Tocharian B. The form of the vocative varies widely across declensional types.

The nominative and oblique dual in Tocharian always maintain the same form in both Tocharian A and Tocharian B.

We may consider nominative and oblique plural forms according to type. Type (a) plurals in Tocharian A always have oblique ending A -s. The nominative shows A -ñ after a stem-final vowel, or A -i after a stem-final consonant (which may be palatalized as a result). Type (a) plurals in Tocharian B always have oblique ending B -ṃ. The nominative shows the ending B -i for Tocharian B e-stems, the ending B -ñ for stems in other vowels, and the ending B -i for stems ending in a consonant (which is always palatalized as a result).

Type (b) nominative and oblique plurals generally have A (zero) B -a. A stem change generally accompanies these endings:

Type (b)	 	Toch. A Sg.	 	Toch. A Pl.	 	 	 	 	 	Toch. B Sg.	 	Toch. B Pl.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	pältsäk	 	pälskant	 	 	 	 	 	palsko	 	pälskonta
Oblique	 	pältsäk	 	pälskant	 	 	 	 	 	palsko	 	pälskonta
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The genitive plural in Tocharian A nouns of Type (b) is A -śśi. Tocharian A frequently employs the genitive singular ending in the plural. Tocharian B has the ending B -ts. Alongside this Tocharian B uses B -ṃts, an ending probably originally restricted to nouns of Type (a).

7.1.3 Primary Case Reference Paradigms

The following tables show the primary case forms for the nouns A yuk B yakwe 'horse' and A oṅk B eṅkwe 'man'. Note that the latter, being human, shows the ending -ṃ in the oblique.

 	 	Toch. A Sg.	 	Toch. A Pl.	 	 	 	 	 	Toch. B Sg.	 	Toch. B Pl.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	yuk 'horse'	 	yukañ	 	 	 	 	 	yakwe	 	yakwi
Genitive	 	yukes	 	yukaśśi	 	 	 	 	 	yäkwentse	 	yäkweṃts
Oblique	 	yuk	 	yukas	 	 	 	 	 	yakwe	 	yakweṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	oṅk 'man'	 	oṅkañ	 	 	 	 	 	eṅkwe	 	eṅkwi
Genitive	 	oṅkis	 	oṅkaśśi	 	 	 	 	 	eṅkwentse	 	eṅkweṃts
Oblique	 	oṅkaṃ	 	oṅkas	 	 	 	 	 	eṅkweṃ	 	eṅkweṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
7.1.4 Preview of Declension Classes

As with many of the other Indo-European languages, the nominal inflection of the Tocharian languages can be divided into several broad classes. Each of these, in turn, often has further subclasses. Given the structure mentioned above, it is not surprising that the division into classes is based mainly on the structure of the endings of the nominative and oblique plural.

This is convenient from a synchronic point of view, since in terms of endings there are few other markers that are sufficiently thoroughgoing as to allow their use as a means of classification. From the standpoint of Indo-European linguistics, this classification system is unfortunate, inasmuch as it often cuts across the typical divisions into PIE *o-stems, *i-stems, *n-stems, etc. However this classification system does highlight the fact that, for example, the nominative singular forms of nouns vary to a large degree, and do not provide much information as to the actual inflection of a given noun.

As a preview of coming attractions, and for convenient reference, the following chart lists the basic declension classes and their primary distinguishing features.

Noun Class	 	Type	 	Case	 	Toch. A Plurals	 	Toch. B Plurals
I	 	(b)	 	Nom.	 	-ā, -wā, -u	 	-a, -wa
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	-ā, -wā, -u	 	-a, -wa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
II	 	(b)	 	Nom.	 	-ṃ, -mnā-	 	-na, -nma
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	-ṃ, -mnā-	 	-na, -nma
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
III	 	(b)	 	Nom.	 	-nt, -ntu	 	-nta, *-ntwa
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	-nt, -ntu	 	-nta, *-ntwa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
IV	 	(a), (b)	 	Nom.	 	(r)i, (r)e	 	(er)a, (är)ñ
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	(r)äs, (r)es	 	(er)a, (är)ñ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
V	 	(a)	 	Nom.	 	-i, -ñ	 	-i
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	-s	 	-ṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VI	 	(a)	 	Nom.	 	-ñ	 	-ñ
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	-s	 	-ṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VII	 	(a)	 	Nom.	 	 	 	-ñc
 	 	 	 	Obl.	 	 	 	-ntäṃ
As one can see from the chart, the division into classes follows primarily according to the forms found in Tocharian B, as for example in Class VII. Class IV contains only kinship nouns with stem in -r-. Some scholars ascribe to Class VIII the nouns which do not fall into the above classes.

8 Adjective Structure
8.1 Adjective Endings
The plural of Tocharian A adjectives are Type (a) in the masculine, and either Type (a) or Type (b) in the feminine. The plurals of Tocharian B adjectives are Type (a) in the masculine and Type (b) in the feminine. The singular of both Tocharian A and B adjectives can be either Type (a) or Type (b). The dual of Tocharian A and B adjective always have identical nominative and oblique forms.

The feminine of adjectives is generally signaled by a suffix A -yā- B -ya- placed between stem and ending. This suffix is present in all forms of the feminine singular. The plural however is not as uniform. All Type (a) forms in Tocharian A and some paradigms in Tocharian B retain the singular stem in the plural. Another tendency in both languages, however, is to use the masculine singular nominative or oblique form as the basis for a Type (b) paradigm.

The above description of adjectives is depicted in the following two tables.

Toch. A Adj.	 	Masc. Type	 	Masc. Stem	 	 	 	 	 	Fem. Type	 	Fem. Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	(a)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(a)	 	[base]-yā-
 	 	(b)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(b)	 	[base]-yā-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Dual	 	(b)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(b)	 	[m/f]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	(a)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(a)	 	[base]-yā-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(b1)	 	[base]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(b2)	 	[m.sg.nom/obl]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Toch. B Adj.	 	Masc. Type	 	Masc. Stem	 	 	 	 	 	Fem. Type	 	Fem. Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	(a)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(a)	 	[base]-ya-
 	 	(b)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(b)	 	[base]-ya-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Dual	 	(b)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	(b)	 	[m/f]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	(a)	 	[base]	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(b1)	 	[base]-ya-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(b2)	 	[m.sg.nom/obl]
In the tables above, [base] stands for the basic stem as found in the dictionary entry. [m/f] denotes the fact that either the masculine or feminine stem may be used. [m.sg.nom/obl] represents the fact that either the nominative or oblique form (not stem) of the masculine singular may be used as the new stem for certain forms.

The nominative singular has no marker for any gender in either Tocharian A or Tocharian B. The oblique singular adds a nasal to the basic nominative form, though in Tocharian B this undergoes the change PToch *-aN > B -ai.

The genitive singular masculine ending is A -(y)āp B -epi (though B -pi appears after a vowel). Occasionally Tocharian B employs the ending B -e < PIE *-os in the genitive masculine. The genitive singular feminine ends in A -e B -ai.

The nominative plural masculine of Tocharian A shows A -e, A -ñ, A -i after a stem-final consonant (which may be palatalized as a result), or just simple palatalization of a final consonant without addition of an overt ending. Tocharian B shows the ending B -i for Tocharian B e-stems, the ending B -ñ for stems in other vowels, or simple palatalization of the final consonant.

The oblique plural has a more irregular formation. In general Tocharian B adds a nasal to the stem. Tocharian A for the most part shows the ending A -s in the masculine, but this is generally added to the nominative form, not to the stem.

The following tables summarize the above.

Adj. Endings A	 	Masc.	 	Fem.
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Sg.	 	[base]-(zero)	 	[base]-yā--(zero)
Gen.	 	[base]-(y)āp	 	[base]-yā--e
Obl.	 	[base]-(N)	 	[base]-yā--(N)
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	[base]-e, (V)-ñ, (C'), (C')-i	 	 
Gen.	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	[m.pl.nom]-s	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
Adj. Endings B	 	Masc.	 	Fem.
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Sg.	 	[base]-(zero)	 	[base]-ya--(zero)
Gen.	 	[base](C)-epi, (V)-pi, -e	 	[base]-ya--ai
Obl.	 	[base]-ai	 	[base]-ya--ai
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Pl.	 	[base](e)-i, (V)-ñ, (C')	 	 
Gen.	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	[base]-(N)	 	 
In the tables above, N stands for a nasal, V stands for a vowel, C for a consonant, and C' for a palatalized consonant. (zero) denotes the absence of an ending, while a blank space denotes the lack of a succinct, overarching pattern.

8.2 Adjective Classes
Adjectives are divided into four main classes. This division follows the Tocharian B forms of the masculine singular. The distinction of the forms is inherited from the Proto-Indo-European structure of the forms, so that there is a fairly clean correspondence between Tocharian adjective types and distinct PIE formations.

There are four adjective classes. These may be split into two basic groups: thematic and athematic classes. Adjective Class I is thematic. This means in PIE terms that the suffix preceding the ending included a vowel, such as in PIE *o-stem formations: PIE *medʰ-i(y)o-s gives Lat. medius, Grk. mésos, Skt. madʰya-. The remaining three adjective classes are athematic, characterized by the lack of such a vowel in the suffix before the ending. Each athematic class is distinguished based on the PIE athematic suffix leading to the Tocharian formation: PIE *-n-, *-nt-, or *-s-. The following chart illustrates the Tocharian adjective classes.

Adjective Class	 	Case	 	Toch. B Plural	 	PIE
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	Nom.	 	-i	 	-oi
(thematic)	 	Obl.	 	-eṃ	 	-o-ns
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
II	 	Nom.	 	-ñ	 	-n-es
(athematic)	 	Obl.	 	-(nä)ṃ	 	-n-ṇs
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
III	 	Nom.	 	-ñc	 	-nt-es
(athematic)	 	Obl.	 	-ntäṃ	 	-nt-ṇs
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
IV	 	Nom.	 	-ṣ	 	-s-es
(athematic)	 	Obl.	 	-ṣäṃ	 	-s-ṇs
Note that a vowel may be part of the PIE ending, even though it is not a part of the suffix, in an athematic form. The thematic/athematic distinction refers to the root suffix, and not to the ending.

9 Present System
The present system of verbs comprises both finite verb forms (the present indicative verb tense) and non-finite forms (the present participle, gerundive, and infinitive). Both the indicative and participle have separate formations for active and mediopassive voices.

The verbs of the two Tocharian languages show several variations in present formation. These different formations are characterized by the suffixes, and sometimes infixes, which are applied to the basic verbal root. Some of these affixes function in a manner analogous to various types in the other ancient Indo-European languages. It is therefore convenient to distinguish those which have their origin in the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, and those which are new formations generated within Tocharian.

9.1 Present Classes
The distinction of the various classes of present conjugation in Tocharian have their origins in different stem formations in Proto-Indo-European itself. Several different types of primary PIE formations have made their way into Tocharian. The root athematic verbs remain in the present CLASS I, as in Tocharian A swiñc 'they rain' < PIE *suh₂-énti, while the root thematic presents remain in CLASS II: B akem 'we lead' < PIE *h₂eǵ-o-mes, cf. Lat. agimus. In two of the Tocharian present classes, the thematic vowel *-o- has replaced the thematic *-e- and been extended throughout the entire paradigm. These are most clearly illustrated in Tocharian B: CLASS III lipetär 'is left over' < PIE *lip-o-tor; CLASS IV osotär 'dries' < PIE *as-o-tor.

The nasal-infixing presents are also well-represented in Tocharian. CLASS VI contains verbs with a nasal infix before a root-final laryngeal, such as AB musnātär 'lifts up', cf. Ved. muṣṇā́ti 'steals'. CLASS VII contains other nasal-infixed stems such as B piṅkeṃ 'they paint' < PIE *pi-n-g-, cf. Lat. pingunt.

Other classes contain suffixed roots. For example, CLASS VIII contains the thematic s-suffix *-se / o-: A nämseñc 'they bow down to, they revere', cf. Gk. némō 'I pay'. CLASS IX contains verbs with the *-sḱe / o-suffix, as in B aiskau 'I give'.

CLASS XII contains verbs derived from nominal items by variations on the PIE *-ye / o-suffix. For example, B lareññentär 'they love' < PToch. *lāren-yä-, cf. Toch. AB lareñ (pl.) 'dear'.

The remaining classes are either of uncertain origin or Tocharian extensions of these basic types. CLASS V perhaps contains verbs with a final laryngeal *-H- or with the suffix -eh₂- found in the Latin first conjugation. CLASS X seems to be a Tocharian extension by *-sḱe / o- of stems already ending in a nasal or nasal followed by a laryngeal, such as the verbs of CLASS VI. Similarly, CLASS XI contains verbs whose stems already ended in the *-se /o-suffix found in CLASS VIII, but which were further extended by the *-sḱe / o-suffix. The present classes of Tocharian are outlined in the following table.

Present Class	 	Type	 	Affix	 	Toch. A	 	Toch. B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	athematic	 	*-(zero)	 	pälkiñc	 	palkeṃ	 	Gk. pʰlégō, Lat. fulgeō
II	 	thematic	 	*-e / o	 	pärtär	 	paräṃ	 	Skt. bʰárati, Gk. pʰéretai
III	 	thematic	 	*-o	 	wikatär	 	wiketär	 	Skt. vijáte, OHG wīhhan
IV	 	thematic	 	*-o	 	plantatär	 	plontotär	 	 
V	 	athematic	 	*-H-, -eh₂	 	śwāṣ	 	śuwaṃ	 	Eng. chew, OE cēowan
VI	 	athematic	 	*-n-H	 	knāṣ	 	katnaṃ	 	Gk. skídnēmi
VII	 	athematic	 	*-n	 	 	 	piṅkeṃ	 	Lat. pingunt
VIII	 	thematic	 	*-se / o	 	arsamäs	 	ersem(o)	 	 
IX	 	thematic	 	*-sḱe / o	 	 	 	aiskau	 	 
X	 	thematic	 	*-n(H)-sḱe / o	 	tämnäṣtär	 	tänmastär	 	 
XI	 	thematic	 	*-se / o-sḱe / o	 	āksisam	 	aksáskau	 	Lat. aiō
XII	 	thematic	 	*-ṇ(H)-ye / o	 	tuṅkiññant	 	āñmantär	 	 
9.2 Present Endings
The present tense may also function as a future, akin to English I am going to the grocery store tomorrow and Spanish Voy mañana al mercado, and in that sense more proper terminology for the present tense would be non-past. More frequently, however, Tocharian employs the subjunctive as a future tense. The subjunctive nevertheless uses the same endings as the present tense. The non-past endings of Tocharian verbs are given in the following table.

Non-Past	 	Active A	 	Active B	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive A	 	Mediopassive B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-m	 	-u / w	 	 	 	 	 	-mār	 	-mar
2	 	-t	 	-t	 	 	 	 	 	-tār	 	-tar
3	 	-s	 	-ṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-tär	 	-tär
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
3 Dual	 	 	 	-teṃ	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-mäs	 	-m	 	 	 	 	 	-mtär	 	-mtär
2	 	-c	 	-cer	 	 	 	 	 	-cär	 	-tär
3	 	-y(ñc)	 	-ṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-ntär	 	-ntär
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ppl.	 	-ant	 	-eñca	 	 	 	 	 	-māṃ	 	-mane
Grnd.	 	-l	 	-lle	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Infin.	 	-tsi	 	-tsi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The participle and infinitive are only employed with the present stem. The gerundive, however, is employed with either the present or subjunctive stem.

The dual form is rarely encountered.

The Indo-European heritage of the Tocharian endings is quite evident in the mediopassive, where the same marker *-r is found as in Latin, e.g. Lat. tingit 'touches' vs. tingitur 'is touched'.

9.3 Non-Past Reference Paradigms
The following chart shows the present forms for the verb AB läk- 'see'. Since the subjunctive also employs the non-past endings, these forms are given as well.

Non-Past	 	Present A	 	Present B	 	 	 	 	 	Subjunctive A	 	Subjunctive B
Active

The forms with asterisks, of which there are clearly quite a few, are unattested. And AB läk- is actually one of the best attested Tocharian verbs!

Note some of the important inequivalences between the Tocharian languages regarding the stems employed in verb formation. In particular the Tocharian B present indicative of AB läk- shows the *-sk- causative formation, but without any change in meaning. Tocharian A, by contrast, does not use this formation in the simple present. Likewise, the form with stem-final long -ā- provides the present in Tocharian A, while it provides the subjunctive in Tocharian B. Tocharian A actually employs a completely different root in the subjunctive.

10 Agglutination
The Tocharian languages are exceptionally beautiful and unique among the ancient Indo-European languages for the way in which they freeze frame an show an intermediate phase in a shift from the PIE synthetic system to a new (from a PIE point of view) agglutinative system.

We may characterize the difference between synthetic and agglutinative languages broadly as follows. A synthetic language is one in which form denotes function; by contrast, an agglutinative language is one in which form fits function. More specifically, the major ancient Indo-European languages are generally classic examples of synthetic languages. For example, Latin distinguishes grammatically a nominative case and a genitive case. In the first declension, we have the following endings:

Latin 1st Decl.	 	Singular	 	Plural
 	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	-a	 	-ae
Gen.	 	-ae	 	-ārum
Thus Latin has an ending for each case and number, i.e. an ending for nominative and genitive, each singular and plural. But note that the ending is different for singular and plural, both in the nominative and in the genitive. There is no single 'nominative ending'. Moreover, the nominative plural ending is the same as the genitive singular ending! Thus, given the Latin form nautae, out of context, one cannot say if the intended meaning is 'sailors' (as subject) or 'of the sailor'. In the context of an utterance such complete ambiguity is rarely felt, but nevertheless possible (as any modern student of Latin is well aware!). Thus in a synthetic language like Latin the form denotes the grammatical function, but not uniquely.

Moreover, in synthetic languages like Latin, the ending may change slightly depending on the form of the stem to which it is applied. For example, the accusative singular of Lat. rex 'king' is rēgem, but the accusative singular of Lat. turris 'tower' is turrim.

Agglutinative languages, however, show in some sense a more rigid matching between form and function. Tocharian exhibits this agglutinative tendency in the secondary cases of nouns (to be discussed more fully in the next lesson). For example, Tocharian A employs the ending -aśśäl to denote the comitative, i.e. to denote accompaniment. This ending is employed any time the sense of accompaniment is desired; the form does not alter depending on whether the noun is singular or plural. The one function is denoted by this one form. Thus, if one wants to construct a form meaning 'with the horse', one takes the noun A yuk 'horse', arrives at the singular oblique (incidentally also yuk), and then applies the comitative ending: hence yukaśśäl 'with the horse'. If one wants to arrive at a form denoting 'with the horses', then one follows an analogous procedure: yuk 'horse' becomes yukas (obl. pl.) 'horses', and finally yukasaśśäl 'with the horses'. The point is that the secondary case suffix is invariant. Comitative is comitative is comitative. The same applies to all other secondary case endings.

Many modern languages the world over function according to this type of agglutinative structure, for example Japanese and Finnish. Tocharian however is the unique instance of an Indo-European language exhibiting this structure. What is all the more beautiful, however, is the fact that Tocharian appears to be in the process of changing from synthetic to agglutinative structure. This too is clear in the nouns (or perhaps it is more accurate to say this is mostly restricted to the nouns). First and foremost, the primary cases still function according to the general PIE synthetic structure, so that nominative, genitive and oblique case endings change depending on the stem to which they are applied. But one finds examples where the Tocharian languages are beginning to treat the primary cases in a manner analogous to the secondary cases.

This change is particularly apparent with the genitive. The genitive, though a primary case and therefore synthetic, still in some sense allows its case marker to 'distribute' over the entire noun phrase. In Latin one says tōtīus mundī 'of the entire world', where both tōtīus and mundī are genitive singular forms, redundantly marking the fact that the noun phrase as a whole is in the genitive. Though Tocharian may parallel such constructions, one also finds A poñcäṃ saṃsāris 'of the entire world' -- here the -is of saṃsāris is the proper synthetic case marker of the genitive; but rather than redundantly mark 'entire' with a genitive ending, Tocharian employs the oblique instead. That is, the Tocharian speaker understands the noun + (synthetic) genitive ending structure in the same fashion as the secondary case construction noun-oblique + secondary case ending. Thus the group inflection typically employed with secondary cases begins to be employed with the primary cases as well. This however is not uniformly applied, suggesting that Tocharian is still in a process of converting from synthetic to agglutinative structure in the nouns.

Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Morphology: Verbals
By comparison to the Modern English system, the verbal system of Proto-Indo-European is quite ornate. In Modern English, the verb give merely displays 5 forms: give, giving, gives, gave, given. In Proto-Indo-European, by contrast, any particular verb can disply dozens of distinct forms. We turn now to a discussion of the categories which describe the formal verbal system.

Tense and Aspect
In many modern, western European languages, we customarily distinguish a number of verb tenses. Tense denotes the placement of an action in time, relative to the moment of utterance. That is, when I say in English "he gave," we say gave is in the past tense, and that this signifies that the action of giving occurred prior to the moment the sentence was uttered. "He gives," by contrast, employs the present tense, and this is supposedly concurrent to the moment of utterance. But here we run into a peculiarity of English: the simple present form typically denotes a habitual action, among other types of action, so that "he gives" typically means "he gives regularly" or "he is always giving," i.e. "he is a generous person." What it does not mean is "he is giving right now." Historically, in earlier stages of English, this situation did not obtain, and "he gives" was truly an action concurrent with the utterance; in Modern English we must say "he is giving" to achieve the desired effect of a true present tense. This brings out a subtle point: not everything that is called a "tense" actually is a tense in the strict sense; at times, however, we will bow to tradition and still employ the terminology.

Verbal aspect contrasts with tense. Aspect denotes the quality or shape of an action in time. That is, aspect does not say, even relatively, when an action takes place, but rather describes something about how it takes place, or rather how the speaker views it taking place. For example, contrast Modern English "he gave" vs. "he was giving." Both verb forms mark the past tense, i.e. they both mark the action as occurring prior to the moment of utterance. They therefore have the same tense. But they do not show the same aspect: in particular, "he gave" represents the action as a complete whole, while "he was giving" does not. To make the distinction more clear, realize that with "he gave," we know that the act of giving began, perhaps progressed, but definitely terminated before the moment of utterance; with "he was giving," we similarly know that the action began and progressed, but we cannot be sure that the action finished before the moment of utterance. We might distinguish these two aspects by saying that "he gave" is completive -- or punctual or perfective -- whereas "he was giving" is progressive -- or non-punctual or imperfective. The perfective aspect views the action as a point in time, whereas the imperfective aspect views the action as an interval of time (with indeterminate endpoint).

Clearly the concept of verbal aspect is more nebulous than its cousin tense, and there are many finer distinctions to be made, not all of which enjoy universal agreement within the linguistic community. As an example of another type of verbal aspect, we might consider the verbal unit "be green," as in "he is green," or even more simply "be" or "exist." These actions -- well, verbs at any rate -- do not sit conveniently within the above framework of completive (denoting a point in time) or incompletive (denoting an interval of time). Linguists assign such verbs to a class all their own called stative verbs, aptly enough comprising verbs which denote a state of being, i.e. something almost out of time altogether.

Many languages, such as German, have morphology which predominantly marks tense: er geht, formally "he goes," but really equivalent to "he is going", vs. er ging "he went." Some languages, such as Spanish, morphologically mark tense distinctions, e.g. dice "he says" (really, "is saying") vs. dijo "he said" (cf. Latin dīcit vs. dīxit); and even mark some aspectual distinctions morphologically, e.g. dijo "he said" vs. decía "he was saying" (cf. Lat. dīxit vs. dīcēbat). Still other languages predominantly mark aspectual distinctions, such as Yucatec Maya: k-inw-il-ik "I am seeing (something)" vs. tz'o'ok inw-il-ik "I was seeing (something up till just now)" vs. tz'o'ok inw-il-aj "I saw (something)." In this last example, the root il- means "see (something);" the prefixes k- and tz'o'ok denote, respectively, aspectual distinctions of ongoing and ongoing-to-the-present-moment, while the suffixes -ik and -aj denote, respectively, incompletive and completive aspect.

Communis opinio, but by no means the only opinio, currently holds that the early stages of Proto-Indo-European demonstrate an aspectual, rather than tense, system. This system comprises three basic aspects: durative (imperfective), punctual (perfective), and stative. Any one of these aspects could be inherent to the particular verbal root's (more on which below) meaning; but the Proto-Indo-European speaker could also shift categories by applying morphological affixes with aspectual content. This structure eventually gives way, at least in large part, to a tense system before the appearance of the documented languages. But the variety of tense structures we find in the daughter languages arises from the intricacies of the original aspectual system of PIE. For example, the fact that linguists may reconstruct (Sihler, p. 446ff)

 	 	*dʰegʷʰ-ti 'is burning'	 	(!)gʷem-ti
 	 	*e-dʰegʷʰ-t 'was burning'	 	*e-gʷem-t 'arrived'
suggests that what distinguishes the imperfect tense (ongoing, past-time action) from the aorist (punctual, past-time action) was not necessarily the morphology, but often the verbal aspect inherent in the root. The PIE root *dʰegʷʰ- 'be burning', 'be on fire' has an inherently non-punctual meaning, so that when a speaker applies hic-et-nunc (here-and-now) morphology in the guise of *-ti, the natural interpretation is as a continuous, present-time action, i.e. as a present tense. When the speaker applies, let's say, the there-and-then morphology *e-...-t, the resulting interpretation is a continuous, past-time action, i.e. an imperfect tense. But with PIE *gʷem-, the outcomes are different: applying *e-...-t produces a form which the speaker interprets as punctual and there-and-then, i.e. a simple past, or aorist, tense; the difference in interpretation can not derive from the morphology, and so must lie in the root itself. The root *gʷem- must inherently have a punctual (non-durative) meaning, "arrive" or "reach this point" (either you've reached it or you haven't; either you've done the verb or you haven't). In this sense, the absence of here-and-now morphology for the root *gʷem- derives from a natural incongruity between the sense of the hic-et-nunc morphology and the inherent aspect structure of the root.

But PIE speakers could also employ a number of suffixes which modify the aspectual structure. For example, we do find evidence to reconstruct

Present	 	*gʷṃ-sḱe-ti	 	*gʷṃ-ye-ti
Imperfect	 	*e-gʷṃ-sḱe-t	 	*e-gʷṃ-ye-t
and even the aorist *e-dʰēgʷʰ-s-t with additional punctual marker *-s-.

Of course the data supporting the reconstruction of the PIE aspectual system is never as clear-cut as one would hope, and exceptions to the above tendencies abound. However the tripartite aspectual distinction durative-punctual-stative goes a long way to making sense of the idiosyncrasies which permeate the tense systems of the daughter languages. To provide a common footing, nevertheless, we may say that Proto-Indo-European itself showed, in its latest stages, the emerging dominance of a tense-based verbal morphology. Generally, scholars identify the following tenses.

Tense	 	Meaning	 	English
 	 	 	 	 
Present	 	durative action, concurrent with utterance	 	he is eating
Imperfect	 	durative action, prior to utterance	 	he was eating
Aorist	 	punctual action, prior to utterance	 	he ate
Perfect	 	action completed as of utterance	 	he has eaten
There also arise further tenses whose inclusion in PIE is more problematic.

Tense	 	Meaning	 	English
 	 	 	 	 
Pluperfect	 	action completed prior to utterance	 	he had eaten
Future	 	action subsequent to utterance	 	he shall eat
The perfect, pluperfect, and future enjoy a special status. The perfect, on the one hand, most archaically derives from the stative, signifying the state resulting from prior action: "I have done" is equivalent to "I am in a state of having completed." In this and other senses, the notion of tense only loosely applies to this category. On the other hand, in some daughter languages, what is termed the perfect is actually a conflation of tenses. In particular, the Latin verb dīcere "to say" forms the perfect dīxit. This form may have two interpretations in Latin, either "he said" or "he has said." Only the latter properly expresses the perfect tense; the former denotes a simple past. In the case of this verb, the sense of the simple past results from the historical morphology: dīx-it < PIE *deiḱ-s-, where the *-s- provides the overt marker of the aorist. In Latin, the twofold interpretation for perfect tense forms derives from the coalescence of both perfect and aorist markers into the same tense category.

The notion that the pluperfect, or past of the perfect, was a truly PIE category meets with some skepticism in the scholarly community. Similarly scholars debate whether the future itself should be counted among the PIE inventory. In particular, as a tense it lacks anything near uniform attestation in the daughter dialects, both in terms of existence as a distinct morphological category and, if it does happen to exist in a given language, in terms of its morphological realization. It is likely that the subjunctive mood filled the role of a future in PIE, and that the future as such was not a morphological tense in PIE itself.

Thus saying that PIE had such a replete system either throughout its history, or throughout all regions ultimately leading to the earliest attested languages, is a gross oversimplification. Hittite for example has a greatly reduced verbal morphology, in many ways more in line with the aspectual system discussed above. Since Hittite is to date the earliest attested Indo-European language, this furnishes the necessity of distinguishing stages on an aspect-tense continuum throughout the Proto-Indo-European period.

Mood
The classical moods ascribed to Proto-Indo-European are the indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and optative. A verb takes the indicative mood when the speaker wishes to relate the action as a fact. The imperative mood denotes a direct command. Both the subjunctive and optative combined constitute the so-called irreales moods, that is, the speaker employs a verb in the subjunctive or optative when the depicted action does not (yet) hold a factual status from the speaker's perspective. Among these two, subjunctive and optative, the optative generally has the further connotation of a wish or desire. As formal categories, these continue to distinguish themselves in English. Consider the following examples.

Category	 	Example
 	 	 
Indicative	 	I was looking...
Imperative	 	Look!
Subjunctive	 	Were I looking...
Optative	 	Would I were looking...
Their morphological distinction, however, is another matter. In general, PIE does in fact distinguish all of these categories based on morphological features. In particular, the imperative distinguishes itself by employing the basic verbal stem and a special set of endings. The subjunctive exhibits a lengthened vowel grade between verbal root and ending, while the optative employs the special suffix *-ih₁. In fact, the morphological distinction between the subjunctive and optative is often clearer than the semantic distinction: for example, the Germanic languages as a whole generally lost the subjunctive and replaced it with the optative. The subjunctive seems also to have served as the future tense. Homeric Greek and Vedic, moreover, provide evidence for a further irrealis category: the injunctive or conjunctive. These tend to show past tense morphology, but often have an irrealis force. Scholars still debate the status of this category, but likely it represents an under-marked form of the verb that takes its interpretation from the preceding verb.

Stem Shape
Proto-Indo-European verbal morphology generally proceeds by adding affixes to a verbal root. For the most part, these added elements are suffixal, coming at the end of the word. Scholars find it convenient to further analyze these terminal elements into two parts, called the suffix and the ending. Thus a PIE verb form as encountered in an utterance breaks down into the following constituents:

 	 	Root	 	+	 	Suffix	 	+	 	Ending.
This is often simply denoted R+S+E. For example, a Sanskrit form such as bʰárati 'carries' would break down as follows:

Surface	 	Root	 	Suffix	 	Ending
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
bʰárati	 	bʰár-	 	-a-	 	-ti
For a given form or a given verb, however, one or both of the suffix or ending may be Ø, as in asti 'is':

Surface	 	Root	 	Suffix	 	Ending
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
ásti	 	ás-	 	-Ø-	 	-ti
The root conveys the inherent meaning of the verb. The root and suffix taken together form what linguists term the verbal stem:

Stem	 	=	 	Root	 	+	 	Suffix.
Any one of the elements in a verb, be it the root, the suffix, or the ending, can undergo alterations of various types to further modify the meaning of the form as a whole.

The thematic vowel is a suffix of particular interest. This suffix takes the form of either *-e- or *-o-, depending on the particular form within a verbal paradigm. For example, consider the PIE roots *bʰer- and *h₁es-, antecedent to Skt. bʰar- and as- mentioned above. The former verb employs the thematic vowel in the present indicative, while the latter does not, as the following forms help illustrate.

Person	 	Present	 	Root	 	Suffix	 	Ending
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
3 Sg.	 	*bʰéreti	 	*bʰér-	 	*-e-	 	*-ti
1 Pl.	 	*bʰéromesi	 	*bʰér-	 	*-o-	 	*-mesi
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
3 Sg.	 	*h₁ésti	 	*h₁és-	 	*-Ø-	 	*-ti
1 Pl.	 	*h₁ésmes	 	*h₁s-	 	*-Ø-	 	*-mes
The presence or absence of the thematic vowel plays an important role in PIE historical morphology. Accordingly linguists divide all verbs into two main classes, thematic and athematic, depending on whether a given verb employs or does not employ the thematic vowel in its conjugation.

Of course PIE languages also display a wide variety of prefixal elements, or preverbs. Sometimes these elements only find application in verb forms, such as the past tense augment *(h₁)e-. But more frequently these preverbs take the form of pre- or postpositions that gravitate strongly to the verbal root and more or less substantially color its meaning. In this latter case, these generally undergo no further modification and become part of the lexical entry in a dictionary. Thus, in terms of the R+S+E analysis of verbs, it is customary to include these with the verbal root under the heading of R.

Ablaut and Reduplication
Ablaut refers to the use of vowel gradation to change meaning within a root. Examples abound in English: sing, sang, sung, song. With each change of vowel, the root s-ng referring to some type of melodic speech act changes grammatical function: sing, present indicative; sang, past indicative; sung, past participle; song, noun. Such vocalic shifts form the bane of any non-native speaker's attempt to learn the language, since the particular type of vowel gradation often depends strongly on the verb: fling, present indicative; flung, past indicative; flung, past participle -- this employs some of the same vowels as sing, but at times in different roles. The assumption of parallelism, can run one into trouble: flang won't beget anything but a chuckle. All hope is not lost, however, since the possible ablaut patterns realized by English verbs actually fall into only a handful of categories: for example hang, hung, hung follows the same pattern as fling; so the problem reduces to one of identifying the few possible ablaut patterns and then remembering which verbs belong to which class, something which proves difficult even for native speakers! (Do I say you sank my battleship or you sunk my battleship?)

Speakers of Germanic languages, however, may at least find it interesting that this system of vocalic alternation, ablaut, is as old as the hills from a linguist's perspective. That is, verbal ablaut is an original feature of Proto-Indo-European itself. Certainly the Germanic ablaut categories do not exactly match those of PIE -- at times they don't even match between Germanic languages -- but the essential system remains in many respects intact. Linguists customarily illustrate the system with an example from Greek: the Greek form leípō means 'I leave,' where -ō is the present indicative ending for the first person singular. Consider now the grade of the root vowel in the following forms.

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Perfect
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	leíp-ō	 	é-lip-on	 	lé-loip-a
We see the appearance of three distinct grades of the root vowel e: full grade e, zero grade Ø, and o-grade o. The above correlation between grade of the root vowel and grammatical function happens to be emblematic of the situation in PIE as a whole. In fact, the above ablaut pattern correlates nicely with the threefold aspectual distinction mentioned earlier: durative correlates with full grade, punctual with zero grade, and stative with *o-grade.

Of course nothing in Indo-European linguistics is ever that easy, and the above threefold system does not depict the whole story. For example, the verb leípō also forms the aorist éleipsa, with the full grade of the root. But we see that this has in addition the punctual marker *-s-, and so this too concords with our notion that the durative stem leip- can be made punctual by other morphological features, as here with the suffix *-s-. Neither are the above the only vowel grades one encounters. There is strong evidence for a lengthened-grade stem in the past tense formations: Latin present indicative leg-ō 'I read' < *leǵ-, but perfect (i.e. preterite) lēg-ī, with lengthened grade of the root vowel.

We also see in the form léloipa the feature of verbal reduplication, that is, the appending of the initial consonant (cluster) and vowel of the root to the front of the root itself. Thus the initial *le- of the root *leip- are prefixed to the verbal root, and then ablaut is applied to the root syllable itself. Such verbal reduplication is a characteristic, but not defining, feature of the PIE stative or perfect. But it is not wholly confined to the perfect, appearing also in the present of some verbs: Gk. dí-dō-mi, from PIE *deh₃. Present reduplication is not nearly as systematic as its perfect counterpart: neither is it as pervasive as in the perfect, being confined to a small number of roots; nor is the formation quite the same, since Gk. dí-dō-mi and Skt. dá-dā-mi show the reduplicated vowel does not follow any clear pattern.

The actual semantics of reduplication still remain obscure. One in fact finds another type of reduplication in which the root as a whole (including root-final consonants) is prefixed to the root itself. This reduplication falls under the heading of intensive, but it remains unclear as to how this relates to present and perfect reduplication.

Primary, Secondary and Perfect Endings
Linguists have been able to reconstruct three basic sets of verb endings for PIE. The first set, called primary, consists of those endings which generally pertain to non-past tense conjugations of verbs in the daughter languages. The second set, called secondary, consists on the other hand of those endings which generally pertain to past conjugations. The third set, the perfect endings, naturally comprises those endings which pertain to the PIE stative or perfect. Each of these sets further divides into active and middle endings, pertaining to the respective voices of the PIE verb. The following charts illustrate the endings.

Person	 	Primary	 	Secondary	 	Perfect
Active	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	*-mi, H₂	 	*-m	 	*-H₂e
2	 	*-si	 	*-s	 	*-tH₂e
3	 	*-ti	 	*-t	 	*-e
n	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Du.	 	*-we-	 	*-we(-)	 	 
2	 	*-to-	 	*-to-	 	 
3	 	*-to-	 	*-teH₂	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	*-me-	 	*-me(-)	 	*-me-
2	 	*-te(-)	 	*-te(-)	 	*-e
3	 	*-(é)nti	 	*-(é)nt	 	*-ēr, ṛs
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Middle	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	*-H₂er	 	*-H₂e	 	 
2	 	*-tH₂er	 	*-tH₂e	 	 
3	 	*-or, tor	 	*-o, to	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Du.	 	 	 	 	 	 
2	 	 	 	 	 	 
3	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	*-medʰH₂ (?)	 	*-medʰH₂ (?)	 	 
2	 	*-dʰ(u)we- (?)	 	*-dʰ(u)we- (?)	 	 
3	 	*-ro(r), ntor	 	*-ro, nto	 	 
The paradigms clearly show that we have more secure knowledge about the singular forms than about those for any other number. Clearly the active primary and secondary endings bear a closer resemblance to each other than either does to the perfect system. In part, the active primary endings recapitulate their secondary brethren, but with the addition of the hic et nunc (Latin "here and now") particle *-i. Interestingly, however, the perfect active endings and the middle endings in general bear an unexpected similarity. The exact reasons for this similarity remain unclear, and the relation between the systems still forms an important area of research.

Participles
Participles are verbal adjectives, that is, adjectives built from a verbal root. PIE possesses a large variety of participial formations. The *nt-participle shows reflexes in a number of daughter languages. This participle was formed by adding *-(e)nt- to the verbal root. This combined in athematic verbs with the weak form of the present stem: *h₁s-ent- > Lat. ab-sent- 'being away'. In thematic verbs the zero grade *-nt- combined with the *o-grade of the thematic vowel: *bʰer-o-nt- > Gk. pʰéront- 'carrying.' As seen in the examples, this formation generally takes on the role of a present active participle. In the Anatolian branch, however, the same formation conspicuously carries the meaning of a past participle: Hitt. iyant- 'having gone'.

Scholars also reconstruct a mediopassive participle in PIE, either *-m(e)no- or *-mh₁no-. This survives in such forms as Gk. pʰeró-menos 'carrying (oneself), being carried'.

PIE likewise contains a perfect participle in *-wos-/*-us-. This was added to the zero grade of the perfect. For example: Gk. (w)eid-ṓs (m.) and (w)iduĩa < *widusih₂ (f.) 'knowing'.

One of the more pervasive formations was the *tó-participle. This was added to the zero-grade of the root and provided the semantic equivalent of the modern past participle in English. In particular, when suffixed to a transitive root, the *tó-participle took on a passive sense, while when suffixed to an intransitive root, the sense remained active: *gʷʰen- 'kill' gives *gʷʰṇ-tó- > Skt. hatá- and Gk. -pʰatós '(having been) killed'; but *gʷem- 'come' yields *gʷṃ-tó- > Skt. gatá- and Gk. -batós '(having) come'. Filling an analogous role is the *nó-participle, which carries a similar connotation: PIE *bʰid-onó- > Eng. bitt-en.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following Tocharian A text is A255, now THT 888 in the new Berlin numbering system. This was the first text published by Sieg and Siegling, appearing in 1908.

The text contains a list of the deeds of past Buddhas, a list also found in the Turkic text Maitrisimit nom bitig. Though there is as yet no reason to suppose that the present Tocharian text forms the basis of the Turkic version, they evidently treat the same material. The general form of the text as a whole is as follows.

Chapters 1--4 relate the story of how Maitreya meets the historical Buddha Śakyamuni, who tells Maitreya that he is the future Buddha. Chapters 5--9 tell of Maitreya's preparation in the city of Katumati. In chapter 10 Maitreya descends from Heaven to Earth. There follows a biography of his youth and the typical three encounters of a Buddha. In chapter 12 Maitreya leaves the city and begins his life as an ascetic. In chapters 16--19 Maitreya proceeds to convert various people he encounters. In the "chapters on health", chapters 20--25, he counsels people concerning the perils of Hell. Maitreya converts King Singha in chapter 26, who subsequently becomes a monk. In the last chapter Maitreya converts his mother, and he himself finally enters Nirvāṇa.

11 Historical Phonology: Vowels
The foundation of all modern historical linguistics lies in the study of phonological development. Two given languages cannot be shown to be either genetically related or genetically unrelated if not by phonological rules: to show linguistic relationship one must establish, either by documentary evidence or by hypothesis, the phonological system of a parent language, and then show how this phonological system develops by distinct rules, with little to no exceptions, into each of the phonological systems of the languages under consideration. The introductions to preceding lessons have discussed the phonological system of Proto-Indo-European in some detail.

The task remains to establish how the PIE phonological system thus develops into the phonological systems of the two Tocharian languages. Due to the relatively recent discovery of Tocharian relative to the other archaic Indo-European languages, the process of pinning down how the PIE system developed into that of Tocharian is very much alive and an area of active debate. These lessons will try to walk a middle path, for the most part quoting standard phonological developments where there is general consensus, but also providing some less than standard conjectures when deemed useful for better understanding, and even on occasion leaving out the phonological history altogether if there is no real consensus or if the rules are technical and of dubious pedagogical value for a first pass through the language.

11.1 From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Tocharian
For clarity, it is easiest to break the changes undergone by vowels into stages, first demonstrating how the sounds of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) resulted in the phonetic inventory of Proto-Tocharian (PToch or PT; also Common Tocharian, CToch), and then showing how these sounds in turn developed into those of the documented languages. This procedure of breaking the historical evolution into stages actually helps shed light on the possible historical relationships Tocharian A and Tocharian B can have with one another. Specifically, one can say that B descends from A only if the sounds of B can be regularly derived from those of A. To put it another way, in deriving Tocharian B from Proto-Tocharian, we would have to be able to consistently insert Tocharian A as an intermediate stage. In current research on the Tocharian languages, this does not seem to be feasible; there are situations in which the Tocharian B reflex must develop directly from Proto-Tocharian, and Tocharian A cannot be interpolated as an intermediate stage. This supports the conclusion that Tocharian A is not somehow an 'archaic' form of Tocharian, and Tocharian B its 'vulgar' or 'popular' or 'modern' form. The two languages most likely developed separately from Proto-Tocharian.

The starting point, therefore, is the Proto-Indo-European vocalic system, as depicted in the following chart.

PIE	 	Front	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Back
High	 	*i, *ī	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*u, ū
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Mid	 	 	 	 	 	*e, ē	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*o, ō	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*a, ā	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In Proto-Indo-European, vowel quantity (length) was an important distinction, each of the vowels having a lengthened counterpart, here denoted by a macron. In some sense, these lengthened counterparts denote a secondary development, whereby a sequence of short vowel plus laryngeal simplified into a single long vowel. For example, PIE *eh₂ > *ā. Thus the above depicted long vowels may be understood as a simplified notation for certain sequences of the form VH, where V is some vowel, and H some laryngeal.

Scholarly opinion still fluctuates as to the exact phonological system which must be hypothesized for Proto-Tocharian. For much of what these lessons treat, the following system will suffice.

PToch	 	Front	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Back
High	 	*i	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*ä	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*u
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Mid	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(*a)	 	 	 	*o	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*æ	 	 	 	*å	 	 	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*ā	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
It bears repeating that, where Tocharian is concerned, ā does not denote quantity (length), but rather quality. The sound represented by ā is short, or to be more precise, indifferent to length. One can see then in the above chart that Proto-Tocharian did not distinguish vowel quantity; length was not a phonemic characteristic in the Tocharian vocalic system.

We also see in the above chart the emergence of two vowels denoted *æ and *å. The position of these vowels within the above chart remains, to date, an educated guess -- there is little approaching scholarly consensus on the actual phonetic qualities of these vowels. In particular, though *æ uses the archaic English orthography for the letter ash, it does not necessarily represent the sound denoted by a in Modern English hat. Why then use this symbol? Simply put, it provides a convenient mnemonic: the Proto-Tocharian vowel represented by *æ results in Tocharian A a and Tocharian B e. The symbol merely combines its outcomes in the respective daughter languages. Similarly for *å: the actual phonetics of the vowel are not altogether clear; but nevertheless PToch *å results in Tocharian A a and Tocharian B o. Their participation in Tocharian umlaut, discussed below, does however lend credence to the idea that their relative phonetic values may be similar to those depicted in the chart.

It remains to describe how the PIE vocalic system descends into that depicted above for Proto-Tocharian. We outline this below, but first we briefly discuss how the Proto-Tocharian system above develops into the systems of the respective daughter languages. This will facilitate understanding of the examples quoted for the development from PIE to PToch.

11.2 Proto-Tocharian to Tocharian: General Rules
To guide one through the maze of historical phonology, there are some rules that, though not exceptionless, may be broadly stated and on which we may hang our hats. These are the following:

Final vowels are generally lost in Tocharian A;
ä is lost in open syllables (1) always in Tocharian A, (2) when unstressed in Tocharian B.
Epenthesis or anaptyxis inserts -ä- to break up difficult consonant clusters.
These rules play an important role in the evolution of the majority of Tocharian words.

For the most part, the remaining PToch vowels develop into what one would expect in Tocharian A and B. That is, as mentioned above, PToch *æ and *å have reflexes which differ among the documented languages; but with the cleverly chosen mnemonic orthography, the outcomes are transparent. As for the other PToch vowels, they essentially pass unchanged into the daughter languages. One exception to this tendency, however, is the effect the accent has on the series of central a-type vowels. This forms the subject of the following section.

11.3 Proto-Tocharian to Tocharian: Accent and the a-Series
The reader may have noticed the parentheses surrounding PToch *a in the above chart depicting the PToch vocalic system. Certainly this vowel appears in the documents of both Tocharian A and B; recall the three-way distinction displayed in the chart below.

Tocharian	 	IPA	 	Example
 	 	 	 	 
ä	 	[ɨ]	 	bit
 	 	 	 	 
a	 	[ʌ]	 	but
 	 	 	 	 
ā	 	[a]	 	father
In that sense AB a may be supposed to form part of the PToch phonetic inventory. But as we will see in the examples to follow, the presence in the documented Tocharian languages of the vowel AB a rarely results directly as a development from PIE to PToch. Many etymologies allow the appearance of PToch *a to derive from synchronic accentual processes within PToch itself, rather than from historical inheritance from PIE.

Specifically, the vowels PToch *ä and *ā show an important interplay with the PToch accent. In fact in many examples they provide our only clue regarding where the PToch accent resided. Note the following alternations.

Alternation	 	Unaccented	 	Accented
 	 	 	 	 
*ä vs. *a	 	*ä	 	*á
 	 	 	 	 
*a vs. *ā	 	*a	 	*ā́
Thus we may say that PToch *ä, when accented, yields *a; and PToch *ā, when unaccented, yields *a. In this way, PToch *a appears as the result of secondary processes, and not directly as the descendent of a PIE vowel.

11.4 PIE to PToch: Non-Palatal Vowels
Palatalization plays an important role in Tocharian phonology, and it is useful to distinguish palatal vowels, which share certain changes in historical phonology, from the non-palatal vowels which do not. We treat first the non-palatal vowels.

11.4.1 PIE *a

The Proto-Indo-European short *a, whether the (rare) original *a or the later result of laryngeal coloring PIE *h₂e > *a, yields Proto-Tocharian *ā. Consider the following chart.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*a	 	*ā	 	 	 	*h₂elyo-	 	*āl'æ + kä	 	A ālak	 	Lat. alius
 	 	 	 	 	 	'other'	 	 	 	B alyek	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*h₂ént-o-	 	*āntæ	 	A ānt	 	Hitt. hant-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'in front'	 	 	 	B ānte	 	Gk. ánta-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*sak-ro-	 	*sākræ	 	A sākär	 	Lat. sacer
 	 	 	 	 	 	'sacred'	 	 	 	B	 	 
We note in the first example the role played by accent in deriving the Tocharian B form: *h₂elyó- > *ā̀l'æ + kä > B alyek, showing the emergence of B a as a result of the PToch unaccented *ā̀. Lest this seem a purely academic matter of historical interest and of lesser import from a synchronic perspective, consider the following example.

Accent	 	PToch	 	Toch
Shift	 	 	 	 
Sg.	 	*pākæ	 	A pāk
 	 	 	 	B pā́ke
Pl.	 	*pākæ-nta	 	B pakénta
In the above example, perhaps inherited directly from PIE *bʰag-o- or perhaps a Middle Iranian loanword borrowed during the Proto-Tocharian period, we see that the Proto-Tocharian accent (often extending back to the PIE accent) has direct consequences in the vocalic alternation exhibited within nominal paradigms. Here we see it is not enough to view the plural form B pakenta as merely the synchronic singular with the addition of a plural suffix; rather we find a change in the root vowel which results from a shift of accent in PToch itself. In the singular, the accent fell on PToch *ā, while in the plural it fell on PToch *æ.

Some scholars suggest that PIE *a < *h₂e may possibly yield PToch *ä in absolute final position, for example in the present tense, second person singular ending, coopted from the PIE perfect ending: PIE *-t h₂e > PToch *-tä > A -t B -t(o) (with 'moveable-o').

11.4.2 PIE *ā

Proto-Indo-European long *ā (including PIE *eh₂ and in general *aH) results in PToch *å. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ā	 	*å	 	 	 	*bʰrā́tēr	 	*pråcær	 	A pracar	 	Eng. brother
 	 	 	 	 	 	'brother'	 	 	 	B procer	 	Lat. frater
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*wā́stu	 	*wåstä	 	A waṣt	 	Ved. vā́stu-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'dwelling'	 	 	 	B ost	 	Gk. (w)ástu
Note in the second example above the typical Tocharian A shift -st- > -ṣt-.

There is evidence that PIE *ā may also result in PToch *ā, for example: PIE *peh₂-sḱe / o- > PToch *pāsk- > A pās- B pāsk- 'protect'. This however may be alternately explained as deriving from an original zero-grade, PIE *pʰ₂-sḱe / o-, and the general rule that a vocalized laryngeal yields PToch *ā. As another example, PIE *wleh₂nt-ih₂ > PToch *wlāntsā > B lāntsa 'queen' may be alternately explained as PIE *wlh₂nt-ih₂ > PToch *wlāntsā > B lāntsa, given that the sequence PIE *-h₂nC- vocalizes the nasal and yields PToch *-ānC-.

11.4.3 PIE *o

Proto-Indo-European short *o, including *h₃e > *o, results in PToch *æ. Consider the examples in the following chart.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*o	 	*æ	 	 	 	*h₃ékʷ-s	 	*æk	 	A ak	 	OE ēage
 	 	 	 	 	 	'eye'	 	 	 	B ek	 	Gk. ṓps
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*ḱṇtóm	 	*käntæ	 	A känt	 	Lat. centum
 	 	 	 	 	 	'hundred'	 	 	 	B *kánte	 	Gk. hekatón
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*ǵómbʰo-	 	*kæmβæ	 	A kam	 	Skt. jambʰa-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'tooth'	 	 	 	B keme	 	Gk. gómpʰos
We also find an example in the pronoun: PIE *so > PToch *sæ > A sa- B se. The addition of suffixes prevents the a- of A sa- from standing in final position, thereby preventing its loss. The following example again shows the importance of the accent in Proto-Tocharian.

Accent	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
Shift	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sg.	 	*tékʷ-os	 	*cäkæ	 	A	 	Skt. tákti
 	 	'a rushing, moving forward'	 	'river'	 	B cáke	 	Av. táčati
Pl.	 	 	 	> B *c(ä)ké-ntā̀	 	B ckenta	 	 
In Tocharian B, PIE *mózgo- 'knot' becomes PToch *mæskæ > B meske 'joint'; but the development in Tocharian A shows an example of the insertion of -ä- to break up a consonant cluster: PToch *mæskæ > A *mask(a) > A masäk.

In some instances PIE *o remains PToch *o, but this generally results from assimilation of the normal result PToch *æ to a following PToch *u or *o < PIE *ō or *ā (umlaut). For example, PIE *(d)oru > PToch *æru > PToch *or(u) > AB or 'wood'.

11.4.4 PIE *ō

Proto-Indo-European long *ō, including *eh₃ and *oH both giving *ō, results primarily in PToch *ā. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ō	 	*ā	 	 	 	*ṇ-ǵneh₃-tih₂	 	*ā̀knā́tsā̀	 	A āknāts	 	Lat. ignōtus
 	 	 	 	 	 	'not knowing, foolish'	 	 	 	B aknā́tsa	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*dʰoHneh₂	 	*tānå	 	A	 	Skt. dʰānā́
 	 	 	 	 	 	'grain'	 	 	 	B tāno	 	 
A more detailed explanation of the first example proceeds as follows: PIE *ṇ-ǵneh₃-tih₂ > PToch *æn-knā-tsā by normal treatment of the vocalized nasal and the semivowel PIE *-i- followed by the laryngeal *h₂. The initial *æ subsequently assimilates to the following *ā, and the cluster *-nkn- simplifies by dissimilation to *-kn-. Thus the entire sequence becomes PIE *ṇ-ǵneh₃-tih₂ > PToch *æn-knā-tsā > *ān-knā-tsā > *ā̀knā́tsā̀ > A *āknāts B aknā́tsa.

PIE *ō however has a varied treatment in Tocharian. In absolute final position, PIE *-ō# becomes PToch *-u#. This PToch final *-u# is subsequently lost in most situations. A similar situation obtains when PIE *ō precedes a final *-s, *-y, or *-(n). Again we find the development PIE *-ōs#, -ōy#, -ō(n)# > PToch *-u# (and subsequent loss). Occasionally PIE *-on# gives a nasalized vowel PToch *-õ, often causing umlaut of the preceding vowel. PIE *ō before a final *-r#, by contrast, results in the normal PToch *ā, and the final *-r remains. The following chart provides examples of these developments.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ō#	 	*-u#	 	 	 	*h₁ēgʷʰ-oh₂	 	*yæku	 	A	 	Hitt. eku-/aku-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'I drink'	 	> *yoku	 	B yoku	 	Lat. ēbrius
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ōs#	 	*-u#	 	 	 	*h₁ēgʷʰ-wōs	 	*yæku	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'having drunk'	 	> *yoku	 	B yoku	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ōn#	 	*-õ#	 	 	 	*ḱléu-mōn	 	*klyāumõ	 	A klyom	 	Skt. śrutá
 	 	 	 	 	 	'possessing fame'	 	> *klumo	 	B klyomo	 	Gk. klutós
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ōr#	 	*-ār#	 	 	 	*h₁ésh₂-ōr	 	*yäsār	 	A ysar	 	Hitt. ēšhar
 	 	 	 	 	 	'blood'	 	 	 	B yásar	 	 
Note in the first two examples that the form B yoku is ambiguous, taken by some scholars as the first person singular of the subjunctive, but taken by others to be the nominative masculine singular of the preterite participle. The fact that both PIE *-ō# and *-ōs# yield PToch *-u# allows the form to descend from either a first person singular or from the PIE perfect participle. Note also that the final *-u causes umlaut of the preceding vowel: PToch *æ > *o.

11.4.5 PIE *u

Proto-Indo-European *u has two outcomes in Proto-Tocharian, *u and *ä, in some sense both equally likely. Consider the following chart.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*u	 	*u	 	 	 	*yudʰ-sḱe / o-	 	*yut-sk-	 	A yutk-	 	Ved. yudʰ-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	B	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	*ä	 	 	 	*h₁rudʰ-ró-	 	*rätræ	 	A rtär	 	Lat. ruber
 	 	 	 	 	 	'red'	 	> A *rätär	 	B	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*dʰug h₂tēr	 	*täkācær	 	A ckācar	 	Ved. duhitár-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'daughter'	 	 	 	B tkā́cer	 	Gk. tʰugátēr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*h₁ludʰ-e-t	 	*läcä	 	A läc	 	OIr. luid
 	 	 	 	 	 	'(s)he went out'	 	 	 	B lác	 	Gk. ḗlutʰon
In the derivation of Toch A rtär we again find the appearance of -ä- employed to break up a consonant cluster: PIE *h₁rudʰ-ró- > PToch *rätræ > A *rätr > A *rätär > A rtär. With PIE *dʰug h₂tēr, we find in Tocharian A assimilation of the initial PToch *t- to the following *-c-: PToch *täkācær > A *tkācar > A ckācar. The forms A läc B lac show how the preterite forms of the root AB lät- 'go out, emerge' still preserve features of the corresponding PIE form also found in Greek and Old Irish.

The development of A por and B puwar poses problems. According to the above rules, we might surmise B puwar < PToch *púwār < PIE *puwōr. However the connection between this PIE form and PIE *peh₂wṛ > Hitt. pahhur 'fire' remains difficult. The form A por may come from an altogether different form in Proto-Tocharian itself.

In initial position, PIE *#u- may develop a labial on-glide (similar to the situation we find for palatal vowels). The seeming necessity of such a rule becomes most evident in the development of A wär B war 'water'. In addition to the labial on-glide, the development seems to employ laryngeal hiatus: PIE *uh₁-ṛ > PToch *wä(H)är > *wäär > *wär > A wär B war.

11.4.6 PIE *ū

Most cross-linguistic evidence suggests that PIE long-*ū only results from the simple semivowel *u followed by a laryngeal: *uH. Some scholars suggest that Tocharian may treat this combination differently depending on which laryngeal followed the semivowel. It appears that PIE *uh₁ > PToch *wä, while both PIE *uh₂ and *uh₃ result in PToch *wā. Compare the following example.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*uh₁	 	*wä	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*uh₂	 	*wā	 	 	 	*wāstu- + -h₂	 	*wåst(u)wā	 	A waṣtu (pl.)	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	(u-stem) + (nt. nom/acc. pl.)	 	 	 	B ostuwa (pl.)	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*uh₃	 	*wā	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
We see in this example the origin of a new Tocharian plural suffix A -u B -uwa, which is then extended beyond historical *u-stem nouns. (Compare the singular form of the same noun, listed in the examples for PIE *ā.)

It should be clearly understood however that, at present, this non-uniform treatment of *uH is an inferral based on

the situation that obtains with the development of PIE *iH, and
a presumed parallelism between treatment of *iH and *uH.
Thus, to date, Tocharian has only furnished clear examples of a development PIE *uH > PToch *wā. For the development of PIE *iH, see below.

11.5 PIE to PToch: Palatal Vowels
The palatal vowels provide the catalyst for the palatalization of consonants which plays such an important role in both the diachronic and synchronic aspects of the Tocharian languages. We must therefore have a clear understanding of the historical development of the original PIE palatal vowels. We turn to their treatment in this section.

11.5.1 PIE *i

Proto-Indo-European *i results in Proto-Tocharian *ä. Palatalization of the preceding consonant accompanies this change, regularly when the consonant is a dental stop or *n, but less so when the consonant is a velar. Consider the following examples exhibiting palatalization.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Ci	 	*C'ä	 	 	 	*mus-ti-m	 	*mäścä	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'fist'	 	 	 	B maśc	 	Skt. muṣṭi-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*kuH-ti-	 	*kwācä	 	A kāc	 	Lat. cutis
 	 	 	 	 	 	'skin'	 	 	 	B	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*diḱ-	 	*dzäk-	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'show'	 	> *tsäk-	 	B tsk-aññ-	 	Ved. diś-
Here C' denotes a palatalized consonant corresponding to the consonant C. Note in the example of *mus-ti-m, the *i causes palatalization of the immediately preceding *t > *c, and the resulting *c causes palatalization of the immediately preceding *s > *ś. Note also in the example of *kuH-ti- the general rule *kw- > A k- in Tocharian A. Both examples show that the previously assumed development PIE *ti > PToch *si > *ṣi does not generally hold true.

In certain environments, the consonant preceding the *i does not palatalize. This generally holds for velars, as in the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Ki	 	*Kä	 	 	 	*sḱ(H₁)iyeH₂	 	*skäyå	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'shadow'	 	 	 	B skiyo	 	Gk. skiá
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*kʷi-so	 	*kʷäsæ	 	A kus	 	Lat. quis
 	 	 	 	 	 	'who'	 	 	 	B kuse	 	Hitt. kuiš
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*wis-o-	 	*wäsæ	 	A wäs	 	Skt. visá-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'poison'	 	 	 	B wase	 	Lat. vīrus
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*-mesi	 	*-m'äsä	 	A -mäs	 	Ved. -masi
 	 	 	 	 	 	1st pers. pl.	 	 	 	B	 	 
One might surmise from the example of *kʷi-so that the labiovelar *kʷ simply does not exhibit palatalization, but this conclusion would be erroneous. We do in fact find palatalization when the labiovelar is followed by *y: PIE *kʷy > ś. Moreover, we see in the same example that PToch kʷwäsæ must have had the accent on the the second syllable; if not, the development into Tocharian B would have been *kʷäsæ > B (!)kwáse, which we do not find.

11.5.2 PIE *ī

As mentioned in the discussion of the development of *uH, *iH has a twofold development within Tocharian. The evidence suggests that PIE *ih₁ > PToch *yä, while both PIE *ih₂ and *ih₃ result in PToch *yā. Compare the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ih₁	 	*yä	 	 	 	*kolh₁ + -ih₁-mi	 	*kælā-yä-m	 	A	 	Skt. cárati
 	 	 	 	 	 	'move' (sbjnct.) + (opt. marker)	 	 	 	B kaloym	 	Lat. colere
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ih₂	 	*yā	 	 	 	*wleh₂nt-ih₂	 	*wlānt-yā	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'queen'	 	> *wlāntsā	 	B lāntsa	 	OIr. flaitʰ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ih₃	 	*yā	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
We see in the example of *kolh₁ that the Proto-Tocharian subjunctive marker combined with the reflex of the PIE optative marker *-ā-ih₁- > A -e- B -oy- to provide the origin of the optative and imperfect markers in Tocharian.

11.5.3 PIE *e

Proto-Indo-European *e has two different reflexes, depending on whether it is word-initial (perhaps following an initial laryngeal *h₁, which does not color the *e) or directly follows a (non-*h₁) consonant. Specifically, we have the following.

PIE	 	PToch
 	 	 
*#(h₁)e-	 	*yä-
*Ce-	 	*C'ä-
Here C stands for any arbitrary consonant, and *C' stands for its palatalized variant. We see that, understanding *C' as the result of *Cy, these reflexes essentially result from the same process, whereby the original *e develops a palatal onglide. Compare the situation in English with u: uvula [yu-vyu-lā́] and nature [ne-cṛ]. The following examples serve to illustrate the historical development.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*#(h₁)e	 	*yä	 	 	 	*h₁eḱw-o-	 	*yäkwæ	 	A *yäkʷ > yuk	 	Skt. áśva-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'horse'	 	 	 	B yákwe	 	Lat. equus
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*en h₃ekʷ-ih₁	 	*yänækyä	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'in the eyes'	 	> *yänæś	 	B yneś	 	Eng. eye
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Ce	 	*C'ä	 	 	 	*ḱlew-o-s	 	*kl'äwæ	 	A klyu	 	Gk. klé(w)os
 	 	 	 	 	 	'fame'	 	 	 	B kälywe	 	 
Note in the example of *h₁eḱwo- that, in Tocharian A, the labiovelars trigger rounding of a neighboring vowel: yäkwæ > A *yäkw > yuk.

Though there are similarities between the developments of *i and *e, the two do in fact generally distinguish themselves. Compare the development of *si with *se in the root *loḱs- 'salmon', with zero-grade *lḱs-:

*lḱs-	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch B
'fish'	 	 	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	*lḱs-i-s	 	läksà	 	laks
Plural	 	*lḱs-ey-es	 	läksäyä	 	läkṣi
In general, all consonants are subject to palatalization preceding *e, whereas only certain types of consonants are subject to palatalization before *i.

11.5.4 PIE *ē

Proto-Indo-European *ē, or *eH, also has two different reflexes, depending on whether it, or *h₁e, is word-initial or whether it directly follows a consonant. Specifically, we have the following.

PIE	 	PToch
 	 	 
*#(h₁)ē-	 	*yæ-
*Cē-	 	*C'æ-
Thus *ē follows its shorter cousin in developing an onglide which results in initial *#y- or palatalization of the preceding consonant; the difference lies in the vocalism of the underlying vowel, which in the case of *ē gives PToch *æ. This, of course, is also the Proto-Tocharian reflex of PIE *o > PToch *æ; thus PIE *ē and *o only distinguish themselves in Proto-Tocharian by the presence or absence, respectively, of preceding palatalization. The following examples will serve to illustrate the situation.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*#(h₁)ē	 	*yæ	 	 	 	*h₁ēgʷʰ-	 	*yækʷ-	 	A yok-	 	Hitt. eku-zi
 	 	 	 	 	 	'drink' (long grade)	 	 	 	B yok-	 	Lat. ēbrius
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Cē	 	*C'æ	 	 	 	*meh₁-nēs	 	*m'æ-ñæ	 	A mañ	 	Gk. mēn
 	 	 	 	 	 	'measure'	 	> *mæ-ñæ	 	B meñe	 	Lat. mēnsis
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*h₂wéh₁-nt-o-	 	*w'æntæ	 	A want	 	Ved. vāta-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'wind'	 	 	 	B yente	 	Lat. ventus
Note in the example of the long grade *h₁ēgʷʰ- of the root *h₁egʷʰ-, the Proto-Tocharian form *yækʷ- apparently undergoes a process of dissimilation, resulting in the common -o- vocalism of the root in both Tocharian A and B. In the example of *meh₁-nēs, note that both *m and *n palatalize due to the following *ē, but PToch *m' regularly depalatalizes to AB m. Observe in the example of *h₂weh₁nto- that the reflex of palatal PToch *w' in Tocharian B is y, whereas the same phoneme depalatalizes in Tocharian A to give w.

11.6 PIE to PToch: Diphthongs
Diphthongs exist in both Tocharian dialects; only in Tocharian B, however, do the original PIE diphthongs remain diphthongs into the daughter language. In Tocharian A, all such original diphthongs undergo monophthongization. The diphthongs that do arise in Tocharian A, therefore, always constitute innovations from a diachronic perspective. The evolution of PIE diphthongs is outlined in the following chart.

PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ey	 	*äy	 	i	 	i
*ay	 	*ai	 	e	 	ai
*oy	 	*æi	 	e	 	ai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ew	 	*äw	 	u	 	u
*aw	 	*au	 	o	 	au
*ow	 	*æu	 	o	 	au
The following table provides some examples illustrating a number of the above developments.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ey	 	*äy	 	 	 	*wéiḱ-o-s	 	*w'äikʷæ	 	A	 	Ved. viś-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'town'	 	 	 	B *yike > ike	 	Lat. vīcus
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ay	 	*ai	 	 	 	*h₂ei-sḱ-e / o-	 	*ais(k)-	 	A esam	 	Hitt. pāi-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'give' (pres.)	 	 	 	B aiskau	 	Gk. aínūmai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*oy	 	*æi	 	 	 	*pe-póiḱ-	 	*p'ä-pæik-	 	A papeku	 	Skt. piṃśati
 	 	 	 	 	 	'paint' (perf.)	 	 	 	B pāpaikau	 	Lat. pingō
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ew	 	*äw	 	 	 	*léuk-os	 	*l'äukæ	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'light'	 	 	 	B lyuke	 	Ved. rócas
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ow	 	*æu	 	 	 	*pout-sḱo-	 	*pæutk-	 	A potkam	 	Lat. putāre
 	 	 	 	 	 	'prune' (subjnct.)	 	 	 	B pautkau	 	 
One major result of the evolution of PIE diphthongs in Tocharian is the blurring of the original PIE ablaut patterns. If we consider *e-, *o- and zero-grades of a root such as *peiḱ- 'paint,' we find the following reflexes for the root in Tocharian.

Grade	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*e	 	*peiḱ-	 	*p'äik-	 	pik-	 	pik-
*o	 	*poiḱ-	 	*pæik-	 	pek-	 	paik-
*Ø	 	*piḱ-	 	*p'äk-	 	Ø	 	Ø
The zero grade eventually loses out, and one finds a two-way, rather than three-way, ablaut pattern: A pik-/pek- B pik-/paik-. More specifically, the present B piṅkäṃ shows a nasal infix. In terms of PIE, however, this should be infixed to the zero grade: *pi-n-ḱ- > (!)p'äṅk-, which we do not find. Instead, Tocharian has interpreted AB pik- as the new zero-grade, obscuring the original ablaut pattern.

Moreover we see f rom the above chart that the monophthong A e and the diphthong B oy found in the optative and imperfect do not descend from PIE *oy, but rather from the coalescence of the subjunctive marker *ā with the PIE optative marker *ih₁. See the discussion concerning the development of *iH.

11.7 Further Considerations: Umlaut
Umlaut describes the process whereby the particular articulation of one vowel affects the articulation of another vowel, usually in the immediately preceding syllable. In these terms, this is a general process found in the act of speech throughout languages the world over. However, in some languages, the assimilation is strong enough and pervasive enough to cause a phoneme shift in certain environments. Such processes have been at work throughout the Germanic languages for thousands of years, assimilating the *o of Proto-Germanic *konungaz to the following *u to produce Old English kyning, and further shaping the y to finally produce Modern English king.

Similar processes run through the Tocharian languages. In particular, Proto-Tocharian *u, *ā, and *o each can trigger the umlaut of vowels in the immediately preceding syllable. The following chart illustrates the process.

Umlaut	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Result
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*u	 	*doru	 	*dz/æru	 	*æru	 	*oru	 	*orä	 	A or
 	 	'wood' (sg.)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	B or
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ā	 	*doru-h₂	 	*dz/ærwā	 	*ærwā	 	*ārwā	 	 	 	A
 	 	'wood' (pl.)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	B ārwa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*o	 	*som(h₂)-e-h₂	 	*sæmā	 	*sæmå	 	*somå	 	 	 	A
 	 	'same'	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	B somo
In the last example, we see that the *o-vocalism of *å can trigger *o-umlaut. As a further example, consider PIE *kléu-mo(n) 'to be heard' > PToch *klyäu-mo > *klyumo > A klyom B klyomo 'noble', cf. Skt. śrutá-, Gk. klutós. Thus the *o-vocalism that produces *o-umlaut can either come directly from PIE, or it can arise within the Proto-Tocharian period itself.

12 Secondary Cases
12.1 Secondary Case Structure
Where Tocharian failed to retain the original Indo-European cases, it seems to have overcompensated for the loss by generating new cases. These secondary cases are generally the result of the merger of the oblique (old accusative) case with postpositions that followed. A few of these postpositions survive as free-standing particles in the documented Tocharian languages, though these particles often do not have the same meaning as the related secondary case endings. The endings themselves are the same in both singular and plural, the difference in forms often coming from the use of the oblique singular or plural, as context demands, and accompanying sound changes at morpheme boundaries.

The development of the secondary cases seems to have been fairly recent in the history of Tocharian. This is suggested by the fact that only a few of the cases employ the same ending or postposition in the two languages, the majority in Tocharian A differing from those in Tocharian B. The new cases are far more regular in form than the primary cases, and have led to Tocharian acquiring in part an agglutinative language structure in nominal morphology.

Both Tocharian languages show reformed ablative and locative cases. These express the same notions of source and location, respectively, as their PIE predecessors, but were early lost and subsequently reformed in the Tocharian languages. The two languages also possess the following new types of secondary cases: perlative, denoting 'by' or 'through' someone's agency; comitative, expressing accompaniment; allative, expressing the 'place towards which'. Tocharian A alone has a reformed instrumental case, expressing means or instrument; on the other hand Tocharian B alone has a causal case, though the function is similar to the instrumental of Tocharian A.

The following table gives the secondary case endings in the two Tocharian languages, as well as the Proto-Tocharian antecedents where they are discernible. The last two columns show particles etymologically related to the case endings.

12.2 Full Nominal Reference Paradigm
There are several classes of nouns in the Tocharian languages. They are distinguished based on the forms of the nominative and oblique plurals. The basic system of declension is nevertheless fairly uniform and simply illustrated. Each noun has synthetic forms for the primary cases, where a given case will generally have a different form for singular and plural. Though there is some uniformity in the endings of the genitive, the nominative may have a wide variety of forms. Some nouns have oblique singular identical to the nominative singular, while others do not. Human nouns have oblique singular ending -ṃ.

The complexity of the primary cases is counterbalanced by the simplicity of the secondary cases. These are agglutinative, so that each case is represented by one form and one form only -- the same suffix is applied to both singular and plural. The secondary case endings are suffixed to the appropriate form of the oblique: the singular of the secondary cases is formed by adding case suffixes to the oblique singular; the plural of the secondary cases is formed by adding case suffixes to the oblique plural.

The basic paradigms are illustrated by the nouns A yuk B yakwe 'horse' and A oṅk B eṅkwe 'human'. These are shown in the following tables. Note that the instrumental case, present only in Tocharian A, is typically not used with human nouns. The causative case is only found in Tocharian B.

12.3 Group Inflection
Tocharian suffers from what one might call the poverty of an inflectional impulse. That is, Tocharian does not inflect nouns more than it has to. When a nominal phrase is in a secondary case, generally all the constituent words appear in the oblique case, except for the last word, which carries the proper ending of the secondary case. This of course makes sense from the point of view of seconday case development: the secondary cases were in origin usually the oblique case of the noun followed by a postposition. The words then are all in agreement in the underlying oblique case, and the postposition (i.e. secondary case ending), postposed to the final element, governs the phrase as a whole. This situation is termed Gruppenflexion, group inflection. Consider the following example from Tocharian A:

A	 	yātälwātses	 	tsopats-tampes	 	nermits/inäs	 	wrassaśśäl
 	 	obl.pl.	 	obl.pl.	 	obl.pl.	 	comit.pl.
 	 	powerful	 	mighty	 	artificial	 	beings-with
which means

 	 	'with the powerful mighty artificial beings'.
And from Tocharian B,

B	 	kektseñ	 	reki	 	palskosa
 	 	obl.sg.	 	obl.sg.	 	perl.sg.
 	 	body	 	word	 	thought-with
which means

 	 	'with body, word, (and) thought'.

13 Adjective Class I: Thematic Adjectives
13.1 Primary Adjectives
Adjective Class I comprises originally thematic adjectives. That is, the morphology of adjectives in this class ultimately derives from PIE adjectives with thematic *-o- in the masculine and neuter. This particularly shows itself in the plural endings.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	*-ó-i	 	*-æi	 	-e	 	 
 	 	*-ò-i	 	*-(æ)i	 	 	 	-i
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	*-o-ns	 	*-æns	 	*-a(i)ns > -es	 	-eṃ
The singular shows greater variability. In general, the adjective endings show a conflation between simple endings of the PIE thematic declensions and "extended" endings ultimately derived from PIE *n-stems. The latter lacks a completely regular distribution, at times providing the unique ending for a particular gender, case, and number; at times providing an alternate long ending. The masculine oblique provides the most salient example: because of the general loss of final consonants in Tocharian, the masculine oblique singular ending -äṃ cannot derive from the ubiquitous PIE masculine accusative singular ending *-m, since this was word-final and therefore lost. Ultimately the Tocharian ending must derive from the nasal suffix itself of *n-stem adjectives.

The feminine ending *-eH₂ or *-iH₂ also appears among the thematic adjectives. This leads to the vowel *-ā- characterizing the feminine of Tocharian adjectives. The PIE *-i- remains as *-y-, which often results in the (secondary) palatalization of the preceding consonant.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	*-iH₂	 	*-ya	 	-(y)i	 	-(y)a
Obl.	 	*-iH₂-n-m	 	*-yā-n-Ø	 	-(y)āṃ	 	-(y)ai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	*-iH₂-es	 	*-yā+nā	 	-(y)aṃ	 	-(y)āna
 	 	*-eH₂-es	 	*-å+nā	 	 	 	-ona
 	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā	 	 	 	-a
Obl.	 	*-iH₂-es	 	*-yå+nā	 	-(y)aṃ	 	-(y)āna
 	 	*-eH₂-ns	 	*-å+nā	 	 	 	-ona
 	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā	 	 	 	-a
As generally with Tocharian nominal endings, these forms derive from various sources. The oblique singular shows the intrusion of the *n-stems; the plural, in addition to showing the athematic ending *-es, also shows possible traces of the thematic ending *-ns. Both of these endings exhibit augmentation via *+nā, ultimately deriving from the neuter plural ending. Moreover the feminine plural in *-H₂ > *-ā demonstrates a direct holdover from the neuter plural.

These endings divide into three major groups. These distinguish themselves according to the presence or absence of -y- (which palatalizes a preceding consonant, according to secondary palatalization), and according to the ending of the plural.

Feminine	 	Group i	 	Group ii	 	Group iii
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-a	 	-ya	 	-ya
Obl.	 	-ai	 	-yai	 	-yai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-ana	 	-yana, -ona	 	-a
Obl.	 	-ana	 	-yana, -ona	 	-a
The general thematic adjective case endings appear as follows.

Them. Adj.	 	A Masculine	 	A Neuter	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Neuter	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-Ø	 	-Ø	 	-(i)	 	 	 	 	 	-e	 	-e	 	-(y)ā
Obl.	 	-äṃ	 	-äṃ	 	-(y)āṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-e	 	-e	 	-(y)ai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-e	 	-aṃ	 	-aṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-i	 	-ānā, -onā	 	-ānā, -onā
Obl.	 	-es	 	-aṃ	 	-aṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-eṃ	 	-ānā, -onā	 	-ānā, -onā
In the above the term neuter represents the so-called alternating gender in Tocharian, that is, the forms associated with nouns taking masculine concord in the singular and feminine concord in the plural. Tocharian A āṣtär B astare 'pure' illustrates the declension of primary adjectives.

Class 1 Primary	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	āṣtär	 	āṣtri	 	 	 	 	 	astare (āstre)	 	astarya
G	 	āṣtäryāp	 	āṣtärye	 	 	 	 	 	astarepi	 	 
Obl.	 	āṣträṃ	 	āṣtäryāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	astareṃ (āstreṃ)	 	astaryai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	āṣtre	 	āṣtraṃ	 	 	 	 	 	astari (āstri)	 	astarona (āstrona)
Obl.	 	āṣtres	 	āṣtraṃ	 	 	 	 	 	astareṃ (āstreṃ)	 	astarona (āstrona)
13.2 Derived Adjectives
Tocharian greatly extends its adjectival inventory by means of a number of suffixes which it productively applies to other nominal elements to produce new adjectival forms. These largely follow the thematic declension described above, but often show greater influence from *n-stem formations.

The suffix *-i(y)o- (*-iH₂-o-) which survives in Latin adjectives in *-ius finds a reflex in Tocharian A -i B -(i)ye. Consider the following examples.

Base	 	Adjective	 	PToch.	 	PIE	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A wäl	 	lāñci	 	*lāñciyæ	 	*wlōnt-iyo-	 	royal
B pacer	 	patarye	 	*pätäryæ	 	*pH₂tr-iyo-	 	paternal
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A ñkät	 	ñäkci	 	*ñäkäciyæ	 	 	 	divine
B ñakte	 	ñäkci(y)e	 	*ñäkäciyæ	 	 	 	divine
In the last example, the adjectival formation to a Proto-Tocharian nominal *ñäkät is straightforward, though the problem of relating this root to reflexes outside of the Tocharian family remains problematic. The extant forms are listed in the following chart.

*ñäkäciyæ-	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminie	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
'divine'	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ñäkci	 	ñäkci(ṃ)	 	 	 	 	 	ñäkc(i)ye	 	ñäkc(i)ya
G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	ñäkci(ṃ)	 	ñäkcyāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	ñäkc(i)ye	 	ñäkcyai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Paral	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ñäkcyane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	ñäkciñi	 	ñäkcyāñ	 	 	 	 	 	ñäkc(y)i	 	ñäkcyana
G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	ñäkcinäs	 	ñäkcyās	 	 	 	 	 	ñäkcyeṃ	 	ñäkcyana
In general the declension of such adjectives follows the pattern provided for adjectives built from the suffix A -ṣi B -ṣṣe, which we now describe.

Tocharian employs three suffixes with particular regularity in the formation of derived adjectives. First among these is the suffix A -ṣi B -ṣṣe < PIE *-syo-. An adjective X-ṣi or X-ṣṣe has the connotation "consisting of X." The forms for the various genders and cases are as follows.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-ṣi	 	-ṣi(ṃ)	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣe	 	-ṣṣa
G	 	-ṣināp	 	-ṣine	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣepi	 	*-ṣṣantse
Obl.	 	-ṣi(ṃ), -ṣinäṃ	 	-ṣi(ṃ), -ṣināṃ, -ṣyāṃ, -ṣṣāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣe	 	-ṣṣai
V	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣu	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-ṣiñi	 	-ṣināñ, -ṣṣāñ	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣi	 	-ṣṣana
G	 	-ṣinäśśi	 	*-ṣināśśi	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣeṃts	 	*-ṣṣanaṃts
Obl.	 	-ṣinäs	 	-ṣinās, -ṣṣās	 	 	 	 	 	-ṣṣeṃ	 	-ṣṣana
These forms are always suffixed to the oblique form of the appropriate noun, generally the singular oblique, but occasionally to the paral or plural:

 	 	Noun	 	Sing. Obl.	 	Paral Obl.	 	Plur. Obl.	 	Adjective	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A	 	ñemi 'jewel'	 	ñemi	 	 	 	 	 	ñemiṣi	 	bejeweled
B	 	naumiye 'jewel'	 	naumiye	 	 	 	 	 	naumiyeṣṣe	 	bejeweled
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A	 	*kanwe 'knee'	 	 	 	kanweṃ	 	 	 	kanweṃṣi	 	pertaining to both knees
B	 	keni 'knee'	 	 	 	kenine	 	 	 	kenineṣṣe	 	pertaining to both knees
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B	 	lakle 'pain'	 	 	 	 	 	läklenta	 	läklentaṣṣe	 	painful
Such adjectival formations generally replace in Tocharian what would be the first member of a compound noun in Sanskrit.

The next major type of derivational suffix is A -ñi B -ññe < PIE *-nyo-. Adjectives with the form X-ñi or X-ññe connote "relating to X" or "pertaining to X." For example, B perne poyśiññe 'the glory pertaining to The All-Knowing', where poyśi < po 'all' and aik- 'know' is a term commonly applied to the Buddha. Consider also the following examples.

Noun	 	Meaning	 	Adjective	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A oṅk	 	man	 	oñi	 	masculine
B eṅkwe	 	man	 	eṅkwaññe	 	masculine
B ost	 	household	 	ostaññe	 	member of the household
The endings follow the above paradigm, with A -ṣ- B -ṣṣ- replaced by A -ñ- B -ññ-, respectively. Interestingly, Tocharian frequently employs this adjective formation instead of an expected genetive. This parallels usage found in other IE languages, e.g. Homeric Odusḗion es dómon 'to the house of Odysseus.' For example, Dʰarmasomäññe Udānālaṅkār-ne 'in the Udanalankara (title of a treatise) of Dharmasoma,' where here the adjective (rather than the expected noun) Dʰarmasomäññe remains in the oblique case according to group inflection.

The last major type of derivational suffix is A -ts B -tstse < PIE *-tyo-. Adjectives with the form X-ts or X-tstse have the connotation 'related to X.' These adjectives often denote possession, as in B kokaletstse 'having a chariot,' from B kokale 'chariot.' The adjective A tsopats 'big' and its synonym B orotstse serve to illustrate the declension.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	tsopats	 	tsopatsi	 	 	 	 	 	orotstse	 	orotstsa
G	 	tsoptsāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	oroccepi	 	 
Obl.	 	tsopatsäṃ	 	tsopatsāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	orocce	 	orotstsai
V	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	oroccu	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	(wākmtse)	 	tspoktsāñ (wākmtsaṃ)	 	 	 	 	 	orocci	 	orotstsana
G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	orocceṃts	 	orotstsanaṃts
Obl.	 	(wākmtses)	 	tspoktsās	 	 	 	 	 	orocceṃ	 	orotstsana
Tocharian A provides few examples of the feminine forms, and of plural forms in general. The above chart illustrates some of these forms with the word A wākmats 'outstanding.'

Note also the palatalization in the Tocharian B paradigm in the masculine, in particular in the oblique singular and the nominative and oblique plural. Interestingly, this palatalization does not arise from historical phonetic considerations; rather the palatalization seen in the above paradigm arises from similar palatalization in other paradigms (due to true historical morphology). In this sense, one can see here the beginnings of a morphological palatalization, a palatalization due to grammatical function rather than phonetic environment.

14 Past System
The past system in Tocharian essentially comprises the preterite. That is, the preterite is the only past tense formation which generally shows its own unique stem. The imperfect and optative both fall under the heading of 'past', in fact employing the same i-marker; however this marker generally applies to the present, respectively subjunctive, stem to derive the imperfect, respectively optative. Moreover, while the optative employs special endings in the active singular, the remaining forms employ the non-past endings. The same holds for the imperfect, except in Tocharian A, which employs the preterite (i.e. past) endings.

14.1 Preterite Classes
In a word, the preterite marker is PToch *-ā-, except when it's not. Less coyly, Class I provides the dominant preterite pattern, and the verbs comprising this class largely come from Indo-European verbs with root-final laryngeal. According to regular phonological changes, this PIE *H becomes PToch *ā. Note however that this vowel is lost in Tocharian A when word-final, as with all word-final vowels in Tocharian A. For example we find the mediopassive PIE *krih₂-medʰh₂ 'we buy/are bought' > B käryāmte, cf. Gk. priato.

Class II is heterogeneous across the two dialects. Tocharian A preserves the system of reduplication found for example in Gk. épepʰnon 'I slew'. In similar fashion, A käl- 'endure' shows preterite kakäl. Tocharian B on the other hand likely derives CLASS II preterites from an original *ē-grade perfect similar to that found in Latin lēgī: PIE *kērs- > B śārsa 'made known'.

The sigmatic aorist leaves remnants in the Class III preterites. As common in Greek, Sanskrit, and even Latin, these preterite forms add an *-s- to the verbal root: A arsāt B ersate 'was evoked' from A ar- B er-, cf. Gk. õrsa, aorist of órnūmi.

Classes IV and V appear to be new formations within Tocharian. Class IV preterites show a suffix AB -ṣṣā- appended to the root, while the more sparsely attested CLASS V exhibits a suffix AB -ñ(ñ)-.

Class VI only contains two verbs, AB lä-n-t- 'leave' and B käm-. They contain traces of an original thematic past tense formation. The following chart summarizes the Tocharian preterite classes.

Preterite	 	Type	 	Stem Shape	 	Toch. A	 	Toch. B	 	Comparanda
Class	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	athematic	 	PIE *-H-	 	katar	 	śtare	 	Gk. skídnēmi
II	 	 	 	PIE *CV-CVC, CēC	 	cacäl	 	cāla	 	Lat. tollō, Goth. þulan
III	 	 	 	PIE *-s	 	arsāt	 	ersate	 	Gk. õrsa, Skt. ṛṇóti
IV	 	 	 	PToch *-ṣṣā-	 	kākätkṣuräṣ	 	kakātkäṣṣu	 	Gk. gētʰéō
V	 	 	 	PToch *-ñ(ñ)-	 	weñār	 	weñāre	 	Gk. eĩpon, Lat. vōx
VI	 	thematic	 	PIE *-e / o	 	läc	 	lac	 	Gk. ēlutʰon
Clearly some of the above formations, such as the stem-suffix AB -ā-, in fact overlap with other tense/mood formations: e.g. AB -ā- also characterizes subjunctive formations, and AB -s- variously marks both present and preterite classes. Scholars have not as yet outlined such thoroughgoing rules as, say, in Sanskrit, which would elucidate why a given verb with one present class would have a preterite of another given class. To date the most satisfactory explanations rest on historical grounds for those verbs which we can trace back to Indo-European antecedents, and synchronic extension to other verbs with similar phonology and/or semantics. In this regard, each verb must be considered in the light of its entire conjugational system from PIE down to Tocharian in order to reveal patterns of association between various tense/mood formations. That is, one seeks to ascertain if the PIE antecedent contains a root-final laryngeal, and if that root formed a sigmatic or lengthened-grade aorist, etc.; thereby one hopefully uncovers naturally the association between its present, subjunctive, and preterite classes.

14.2 Past Endings
The past endings pertain to the preterite verb forms of all classes, save Class VI, which shows some variation. Tocharian A also employs the past endings in the imperfect, with the exception of the imperfects A yem and ṣem. Tocharian A optative endings differ in the active singular. Tocharian B shows slightly different endings in the active singular of both optative and imperfect; the remaining forms employ the past endings. The following table shows the Tocharian past endings.

Past	 	Active A	 	Active B	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive A	 	Mediopassive B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-(w)ā	 	-wa	 	 	 	 	 	-(w)e	 	-mai
2	 	-ṣt	 	-sta	 	 	 	 	 	-te	 	-tai
3	 	-(s)ā-	 	-(s)a	 	 	 	 	 	-t	 	-te
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
3 Dual	 	*-ymas	 	-ys	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-mäs	 	-m	 	 	 	 	 	-mät	 	-mte
2	 	-s	 	-s	 	 	 	 	 	-c	 	-t
3	 	-r	 	-r(e)	 	 	 	 	 	-nt	 	-nte
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ppl.	 	-u	 	-u	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
For reference, we record here the optative endings, which depart from the past endings only in the active singular.

Optative	 	Active A	 	Active B
 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-m	 	-m
2	 	-t	 	-t
3	 	-ṣ	 	-Ø
 	 	 	 	 
Else	 	Past	 	Past
The Tocharian A endings therefore mimic the non-past endings in the active singular, whereas the corresponding Tocharian B forms are almost altogether different. In the remaining active forms, and in all mediopassive forms, they are identical with the past endings.

14.3 Past Reference Paradigms
The table below presents the preterite forms of the verb AB läk- 'see'. As in the present system, A pälk- completes the suppletive paradigm in Tocharian A.

Past	 	Active A	 	Active B	 	 	 	 	 	Mediopassive A	 	Mediopassive B

Unfortunately the active forms of A pälk- are unattested, unlike the mediopassive. Tocharian B on the other hand shows a rather full paradigm.

15 Coordination
A noun and accompanying adjective must agree in grammatical gender. Most Tocharian adjective endings distinguish clearly between masculine and feminine endings; few Tocharian nouns, by contrast, have terminations that signal grammatical gender with any regularity. In practice, therefore, one determines the grammatical gender of a noun by the grammatical gender of the associated adjective. Some nouns, however, take masculine concord in the singular and feminine in the plural. Such nouns therefore constitute a third grammatical gender, generally termed alternating in Tocharian handbooks. For example:

 	 	Singular	 	Plural
A	 	tsopats (m.) wäl	 	śāwe (m.) lāṃś
B	 	orotstse (m.) walo	 	orocci (m.) lāñc
 	 	'great king'
 	 	 	 	 
A	 	sās (f.) ytār	 	toṣ (f.) ytāräṃ
B	 	sā (f.) ytārye	 	toy (f.) ytariñ
 	 	'this way'
 	 	 	 	 
A	 	säs (m.) oko	 	toṣ (f.) okontu
B	 	se (m.) oko	 	toy (f.) okonta
 	 	'this fruit'
Tocharian B, however, occasionally breaks this rule when convenient. Specifically, Tocharian B will at times employ a masculine adjectival form when it should properly use a feminine to ensure that the words fit the poetic meter.

A noun and accompanying adjective must agree in case. That is, if a noun in, say, the genitive case is accompanied by an adjective, that adjective too must be in the genitive case. Such concord pervades the ancient Indo-European languages. Tocharian, however, has decided that such a rule is more of a guideline, and therefore remains a bit lax. Specifically, recall that the secondary nominal cases derive from postpositions appended to the oblique case form of the underlying noun. This underlying oblique form leads to so-called group inflection, or Gruppenflexion: an adjective modifying a noun in a secondary case will generally be in the oblique. Consider the following examples.

A	 	āṣāniāṃ	 	Metraknaśśäl	 	 	 	together with the worthy Maitreya
 	 	oblique	 	commitative	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B	 	cämpamñecceṃ	 	orocceṃ	 	wnolmeṃmpa	 	together with the great (and) able beings
 	 	oblique	 	oblique	 	commitative	 	 
As mentioned in the previous lesson, Tocharian has interestingly extended this even to the genitive case, even though this case does not derive from the union of the oblique case with a postposition. Consider the following examples.

Gen.-Gen.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A	 	ṣomāp	 	lānt	 	of one king
 	 	genitive	 	genitive	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B	 	cwi	 	yāmorntse	 	of this deed
 	 	genitive	 	genitive	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.-Gen.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A	 	śāwes	 	käṣṣiśśi	 	of the good teachers
 	 	oblique	 	genitive	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B	 	añmalāṣkeṃ	 	käṣṣintse	 	of the compassionate teacher
 	 	oblique	 	genitive	 	 
Tocharian similarly employs the oblique in a parallel string of nouns. That is, given a sequence of nouns -- be they parallel items in a list or equated to one another through apposition -- in a secondary case, typically only the last item carries the secondary case ending. Consider the following.

A	 	kuklas	 	yukas	 	oṅkälmāsyo	 	with wagons, horses, and elephants
 	 	oblique	 	oblique	 	instrumental	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B	 	kokleṃ	 	 	 	oṅkolmaṃnpā	 	with wagons and elephants
 	 	oblique	 	 	 	commitative	 	 
We see from the examples above that an adjective must agree in number with the noun it modifies. Similarly, a verb and its subject must agree in number.

Lesson 4
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Morphology: Nominals
Proto-Indo-European demonstrates a rich array of nominal morphology. PIE inflects nouns for gender, case, and number. Three numbers arise in PIE: singular, dual, and plural. We find evidence for eight cases in PIE -- nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative -- whose significance has been discussed in Lesson 2. We discuss below further points of gender and case, as well as other important features of nouns in Proto-Indo-European.

Grammatical Gender
In general ancient IE languages display three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. As mentioned in the first lesson, the term gender is really only a shorthand for a system of agreement between nouns and adjectives, ensuring that the listener understands which adjective modifies which noun. As such, the general term 'gender', as well as the individual groupings 'masculine', 'feminine' and 'neuter', are misleading in that they have nothing in principle to do with biological gender. As it happens, however, when a noun refers to something that does possess a biological gender, those that have male gender are generally represented by nouns with masculine grammatical gender, and females with the feminine gender. But this division is not at all strict: Latin nauta 'sailor' generally denotes a male, even though it declines according to the pattern of feminine nouns; German Sonne and Old English sunne 'sun' decline as feminine nouns, even though the sun has no biological gender of any sort.

Evidence from Anatolian, in particular Hittite, suggests that the three-way split between masculine, feminine and neuter may not represent the earliest state of affairs in PIE. In particular, Hittite only shows a two-fold grammatical gender system: masculine and neuter in the terminology above. The particular distribution of these grammatical genders among Hittite nouns suggests that 'masculine' really denotes animate nouns, while 'neuter' denotes inanimate. The origin of the later 'feminine' gender in PIE thus remains somewhat of a mystery, but some evidence points to its development out of the neuter plural, reinterpreted as a singular collective.

Stem Shape
One remarkable feature of PIE morphology in general is that, at the most basic level, noun structure parallels that of verb structure. By that I mean that any given noun may be decomposed into

 	 	Root	 	+	 	Suffix	 	+	 	Ending,
just like any verb. Take for example Gk. géneos 'of a kind', from earlier *géne(s)os:

Surface	 	Root	 	Suffix	 	Ending
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
géneos	 	gén-	 	-e(s)-	 	-os
The nominal suffixes and endings generally do not overlap with those of the verbal morphology (we do need to distinguish verbs and nouns, after all! Or do we...?), but amazingly enough the nominal roots very often do overlap with verbal roots. That is, we find generally that IE languages have ways of employing the same root as either a noun or a verb. In English we experience this daily with such alternations as sing (verb) versus song (noun), clearly derived from the same root by a morphophonetic process (ablaut) that allows a formal change between categories. Equally, in English we may cross categories simply by verbing a noun, or nouning a verb... that is, we need not apply any special process to the root to convert from one category to another.

We also saw that the verbal suffix can be thematic or athematic, i.e. it can contain or not a thematic vowel *-e- or *-o-. Remarkably, the same holds true for PIE nouns: suffixes can be either thematic or athematic.

Any of the root, suffix, or ending could contain a vowel in *Ø-, full-, or long-grade. The grade often shows a curious interplay with the accent pattern of the noun throughout its declensional paradigm.To understand this interplay, we should first distinguish between two types of cases: strong cases and weak cases. Here strong and weak bear no relation to similar uses in describing the declension of adjectives or conjugation of verbs; it simply seems that, ironically, linguists are loathe to develop new terminology when simple misapplication of arcane terminology will suffice. At any rate, we have the following pattern of strong and weak cases:

 	 	Singular	 	Dual	 	Plural
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	strong	 	strong	 	strong
Vocative	 	strong	 	strong	 	strong
Accusative	 	strong	 	strong	 	 
Genitive	 	 	 	 	 	 
Ablative	 	 	 	 	 	 
Dative	 	 	 	 	 	 
Instrumental	 	 	 	 	 	 
Locative	 	 	 	 	 	 
All unmarked cases in the above chart are weak. We see that, properly, the strong vs. weak distinction is one of case and number, since scholars generally agree that the accusative was not strong in all numbers. The importance with regard to the nominal accent in PIE derives from the following occurrence:

the syllable with full vowel grade generally shifts right in the weak cases;
the accent generally shifts to the right in the weak cases.
Here 'to the right' should be understood as shorthand for 'toward the end of the word'. Of course, where the full grade of the vowel and where the accent wind up in the weak cases each depend on two factors:

which syllable contains the (a) full grade of the vowel and (b) the accent;
how far (a) the full grade and (b) the accent jump in the weak cases.
Though this should lead in principle to four independent parameters (location of full vowel, location of accent, jump of full vowel, jump of accent), interestingly we find that the two tend to pattern together. That is, the accent tends to remain over the full vowel, so that the location of one dictates the location of the other, and similarly for the jump. Given these parameters and the correlation between them, we may therefore classify nouns into a few basic types: acrostatic, mesostatic, proterokinetic, hysterokinetic, amphikinetic (or holokinetic). We describe their accent and vowel patterns in the chart below.

 	 	Acrostatic	 	Mesostatic	 	Proterokinetic	 	Hysterokinetic	 	Amphikinetic
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E
Weak	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E	 	R-S-E
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*nókʷ-t-s	 	*poH₂i-mḗ(n)	 	*mén-ti-s	 	*pH₂-tér-s	 	*H₂éus-ōs
Genitive	 	*nékʷ-t-s	 	*poH₂i-mén-s	 	*mṇ-téi-s	 	*pH₂-tr-és	 	*H₂us-s-és
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Meaning	 	night	 	shepherd	 	thought	 	father	 	dawn
In the above, R, S, and E naturally stand for root, suffix, and ending, respectively. The boldface letter denotes which of these three elements carries the full vowel and accent in that particular type of case. Below we find examples of each pattern, employing the nominative as the exemplar of the strong cases, the genitive for the weak. Though other full vowel and accent patterns could occur in principle, linguistic reconstruction has generally isolated the above as the dominant patterns in PIE nominal declension. Moreover, PIE speakers could form new nouns merely by shifting the accent of a given noun through a process known as internal derivation

Proto-Indo-European maintains a dizzying array of possible nominal suffixes. We list below some of the more productive suffixes:

*n-Stems: One of the most productive suffixes in PIE was *-n-. This could appear with a vowel as *-on- or *-en-. This pertains to both animate and neuter nouns. It also shows a large number of associated suffixes: *-men-, -sen-, -ten-, -wen-. The first of these finds wide application in building neuter abstract nouns to a verbal root, with nominative *-mṇ, genitive *-men-s. For example, *kwer-mṇ > Skt. kár-ma 'thing done', 'deed'; *dʰH₁-mṇ > Gk. tʰé-ma 'thing placed', 'theme'.
*r-Stems: The most basic suffix contains only the *-r-, perhaps with a vowel: *ǵʰes-r- 'hand' > Gk. kʰeir-. This class however contains numerous variants. Among the suffixes ending in *-r are *-ter- and *-tor-, means of deriving agent nouns. The agent may or may not have performed the act: *dH₃-tḗr 'one whose role is to give' > Ved. dātā́, Gk. dotḗr; *déH₃-tōr 'one who has in fact given' > Ved. dā́tā, Gk. dṓtōr. We also encounter the -ter- of familial nouns: *pH₂-ter- 'father', etc.
*r/*n-Stems: Even the speakers of PIE itself appear to have been confused by the various suffixes, and we find evidence of words mixing both *r- and *n-stem formations. Interestingly, the division of stems maintains a certain logic, with *-r- appearing in the nominative and accusative singular, and *-n- elsewhere. Take the following noteworthy example: *wód-ṛ 'water', together with *wéd-n- in other cases, preserved in Hittite wātar (nominative), witenas (genitive); similarly we find a divide among branches of Germanic, where Western Germanic seems to favor the *r-stem (English water), but Northern Germanic the *n-stem (ON vatn).
*s-Stems: The suffix *-os in the strong cases, paired with *-es- in the weak, generally produces an abstract noun from a verbal root, e.g. *ǵenH₁- 'be born' vs. *genH₁-os 'birth, race', cf. Gk. génos, Lat. genus. Internal derivation could produce an animate noun from an associated verbal abstract: *ḱerH₁-os 'grain' > Ger. Hirse 'millet'; but *ḱerH₁-ḗs 'grain producer' > Lat. Cerēs.
*t-Stems: This suffix is generally associated with feminine abstract nouns. For example, *déḱṃ 'ten', but *deḱṃ-t- 'decad' > Ved. daśát-. We find a plethora of other *t-stem suffixes generating abstract nouns: *-teH₂-t- > Lat. liber-tāt- 'freedom'.
*nt-Stems: Among the *nt-stems we classify the present participle formations in numerous IE languages. We also find a common possessive suffix, *-went-. This yields the suffix -vant- in Sanskrit adjectives such as bʰaga-vant- 'possessing wealth (bʰágas)'.
*i- and *u-Stems: The suffixes *-i- and *-u- alternate with respective full-grade forms, *-ei- and *-eu-. These may combine with other suffixal elements, such as *-t-. For example, nominative *mén-ti-s, genitive *mṇ-téi-s, giving Vedic matí- 'thought', with the root form *mṇ- generalized throughout the paradigm.
Thematic Stems: The thematic suffixes comprise *-e- and *-o-. The latter, *-o-, dominates by far the nominal landscape of the ancient attested IE languages. For example, *dom-o-s > Gk. dómos 'household'; *aiw-o-m > Lat. aevum 'age, eternity'.
Case Endings
To the suffix Proto-Indo-European adds endings to denote case. These case endings determine the grammatical function of a given noun in an utterance. Reconstruction has uncovered some differences between the endings employed for thematic and athematic nouns. In principle, we should also find different endings for the masculine, feminine, and neuter genders. But as mentioned above, we find that the feminine gender seems to be a later innovation, so that we are left in the earliest stages of PIE with a simple distinction between animate (masculine) and inanimate (neuter). Moreover, masculine and neuter agree in all cases other than nominative, accusative, and vocative. Thus, the actual inventory of desinences is greatly reduced. The following chart displays side-by-side the thematic and athematic endings for both animate and inanimate genders in all numbers (cf. Fortson 2004).

 	 	Athem. Sg.	 	Them. Sg.	 	Athem. Du.	 	Them. Du.	 	Athem. Pl.	 	Them. Pl.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. anim.	 	*-s	 	*-o-s	 	*-H₁	 	*-ō < *-o-H₁	 	*-es	 	*-ōs < *-o-es
Voc.	 	*-Ø	 	*-e	 	*-H₁	 	*-ō < *-o-H₁	 	*-es	 	*-ōs < *-o-es
Acc. anim.	 	*-m	 	*-o-m	 	*-H₁	 	*-ō < *-o-H₁	 	*-ns	 	*-o-ns
Nom./Acc. neut.	 	*-Ø	 	*-o-m	 	*-iH₁	 	*-o-iH₁	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā < *-e-H₂
Gen.	 	*-s	 	*-o-s	 	 	 	 	 	*-ōm	 	*-ōm
Abl.	 	*-s	 	*-ōt < *-o-H₂at	 	 	 	 	 	*-bʰ-	 	*-o(i)-bʰ-
Dat.	 	*-ei	 	*-ōi < *-o-ei	 	 	 	 	 	*-bʰ-	 	*-o(i)-bʰ-
Instr.	 	*-H₁	 	*-ō < *-o-H₁	 	 	 	 	 	*-bʰ-	 	*-o(i)-bʰ-
Loc.	 	*-i	 	*-o-i	 	 	 	 	 	*-su	 	*-oi-su
We see in the above chart that scholars have difficulty reconstructing the weak cases of the dual. In the other forms, however, we notice an incredible similarity between thematic and athematic endings: the thematic ending for a given case and number echoes its athematic counterpart, but with the insertion of the thematic vowel. Some scholars also take the nominative/accusative plural form of the neuter, *-ā < *-e-H₂, as the point of departure for the feminine gender: the PIE speakers evidently viewed this form as a collective, and hence singular, in regard to some nouns. The above chart does not include all forms reconstructed for PIE nominals, but rather only a selection of the most pervasive.

In the end, the form encountered for any given noun derives from some root, one of the suffixes of the previous section, and one of the endings listed in the chart above. We of course do not see the above chart reflected exactly in any of the ancient attested daughter languages. As in Tocharian, cases tend to fall away or be added, and as this happens certain endings may be reinterpreted and recast as endings for another case.

Pronouns
Even a cursory glance across the ancient Indo-European languages shows an obvious affinity among the pronouns. The details of this affinity, however, are often difficult to piece together. One thing is certain: the pronouns followed a declensional pattern that differed somewhat from that employed with other nouns and adjectives. Some of the endings are clear for certain types of pronouns, but other remain rather elusive.

The personal pronouns evidently showed differing forms depending on whether they retained their own accent in an utterance or whether they borrowed it, so to speak, from a neighboring word (the so-called enclitic usage). These pronouns only distinguish person, case, and number; they do not distinguish grammatical gender in PIE. In addition to the first ('I', 'we') and second ('thou', 'you all') person pronouns, we also find reason to reconstruct a reflexive pronoun (roughly equivalent to '-self' in English usage of 'himself', etc.). The following chart outlines the PIE forms of these pronouns (cf. Adams 1988).

 	 	1st Pers.	 	2nd Pers.	 	Refl.

Nominative	 	*weys, weyom	 	*yuHs, yuHom	 	 
Acc. unstressed	 	*nos	 	*wos	 	 
Acc. stressed	 	*ṇsmé	 	*usmé	 	 
Gen. unstressed	 	 	 	 	 	 
Gen. stressed	 	 	 	 	 	 
Many of the above forms continue to be debated, and other forms are too uncertain to even be listed.

Proto-Indo-European also possesses a number of deictic (pointing) pronouns, akin to English 'this' or 'that'. One in particular finds employment as a third person pronoun ('he', 'she', 'it') built to the stems *so- and *to-. Though some of the details of the paradigm remain obscure, several PIE forms may be reconstructed with relative confidence.

3rd Person	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*so	 	*sā	 	*tod
Accusative	 	*tom	 	*tām	 	*tod
Genitive	 	*teso	 	 	 	*teso
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*toy	 	*tās	 	*tā
Accusative	 	*tons	 	*tāns	 	*tā
Following a similar declension pattern is the interrogative ('who', 'what') pronoun with stem *kʷo-. This pronoun also served as an indefinite pronoun ('someone', 'anyone').

16 Historical Phonology: Consonants
The development of the PIE consonants in Tocharian provides a story no less interesting than that of the PIE vowels. The development of the consonants, in fact, revealed one of the most stunning early discoveries in the study of Tocharian: that the Tocharian languages lie within the Centum group, not within the Satem group of their geographic neighbors, and therefore undermine earlier notions of a simple geographic correlation of the Centum-Satem distinction.

Aficionados of smaller phonetic inventories will happily note that the Tocharian group largely streamlines the consonantal inventory of Proto-Indo-European. In particular, voicing and aspiration each lose their phonemic distinction, and so PIE consonants such as *b and *bʰ both become leveled with *p. One must keep in mind, however, that this denotes phonemic rather than phonetic leveling. That is, we cannot say whether the Proto-Tocharian *p into which all of *p, *b and *bʰ collapsed was pronounced with or without, say, aspiration; rather, we can only say that the distinction no longer remained important, as in English pot, where it makes no difference for understanding whether the initial p is deaspirated or not -- though it sounds a little unusual to a native speaker if it is.

Concomitant with this pruning of the PIE consonantal inventory, we find in Tocharian the rise of a process of palatalization which subsequently introduces some new phonemes into the inventory. This palatalization is distinct from that observed in the Satem languages and should be understood as a solely Tocharian process. Interestingly, we see Tocharian regularize the subsequent phonemic alternations that arise in certain common morphological paradigms and extend them beyond their original boundaries, in effect creating in certain paradigms a morphological palatalization.

16.1 From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Tocharian
We take as our starting point the Proto-Indo-European consonant inventory. The general consensus among scholars settles on the following system.

 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Palatal	 	Velar	 	Labiovelar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Voiceless	 	*p	 	*t	 	*ḱ	 	*k	 	*kʷ
Voiced	 	*b	 	*d	 	*ǵ	 	*g	 	*gʷ
Voiced Asp.	 	*bʰ	 	*dʰ	 	*ǵʰ	 	*gʰ	 	*gʷʰ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sibilant	 	 	 	*s	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Laryngeal	 	 	 	 	 	*H₁	 	*H₂	 	*H₃
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasal	 	*m	 	*n	 	 	 	 	 	 
Liquid	 	 	 	*l	 	*r	 	 	 	 
Semivowel	 	*w	 	 	 	*y	 	 	 	 
The association of the laryngeals *H with particular points of articulation leaves something to conjecture, and the above merely represents one possibility which has found some support among scholars (see, e.g., Ringe 1996). We include the laryngeals in the above chart for completeness, though we will treat their development separately in the following lesson.

Reconstruction of the Proto-Tocharian consonant inventory leaves us with the system outlined in the following chart.

 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Alveolar	 	Palatal	 	Velar	 	Labiovelar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stop	 	*p	 	*t	 	 	 	 	 	*k	 	*kʷ
 	 	*p'	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Affricate	 	 	 	*ts	 	*c	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sibilant	 	 	 	*s	 	*ṣ	 	*ś	 	 	 	 
Nasal	 	*m	 	*n	 	 	 	*ñ	 	 	 	 
Liquid	 	 	 	*l	 	*r	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	*l'	 	*r'	 	 	 	 	 	 
Semivowel	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*y	 	 	 	*w
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*w'
The above chart depicts quite clearly the reduced number of stop consonants. Similarly we find the introduction of some palatal consonants, as well as palatalized variants of other, non-palatal consonants. For a given consonant C we denote by C' its palatalized variant.

In broad outline, the development from the PIE consonantal system to that of Proto-Tocharian follows from a few major principles:

Merger of PIE palatals and velars;
Grassmann's Law;
Deaspiration;
Palatalization;
Devoicing.
We discuss each one of these processes in turn.

16.1.1 Merger of PIE Palatals and Velars

The first major principle, mentioned above, concerns the merger of the PIE palatal and velar stops, lining Tocharian up with the other Centum languages:

 	 	PIE *Ḱ > *K,
where *Ḱ represents any of *ḱ, *ǵ, *ǵʰ, and similarly *K represents any of *k, *g, *gʰ. A large swath of the ancient Indo-European languages share this merger, and this would lead us to suspect that this denotes a shared dialectal innovation within a subgrouping of the speakers of the parent language Proto-Indo-European. Though this likely contains some germ of truth, the actual state of affairs nevertheless remains somewhat murky. For example, we will see with Grassmann's Law below that Tocharian shares innovations with both Greek and Sanskrit, the latter belonging to the Satem group.

Tocharian naturally exhibits numerous examples of this change. Consider the following.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Ḱ	 	*K	 	 	 	*ḱṇtóm	 	*käntæ	 	A känt	 	Lat. centum
 	 	 	 	 	 	'hundred'	 	 	 	B kánte	 	Gk. hekatón
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*ṇ-ǵneH₃-tiH₂	 	*ā̀knā́tsā̀	 	A āknāts	 	Lat. ignōtus
 	 	 	 	 	 	'not knowing, foolish'	 	 	 	B aknā́tsa	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*ǵómbʰo-	 	*kæmβæ	 	A kam	 	Skt. jambʰa-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'tooth'	 	 	 	B keme	 	Gk. gómpʰos
16.1.2 Grassmann's Law

Tocharian joins Greek and Sanskrit in a very select club among the ancient Indo-European languages which shows the operation of Grassmann's Law. According to this law, when successive syllables begin with aspirated consonants Cʰ, the consonant beginning the first syllable loses its aspiration:

 	 	PIE *CʰVCʰ- > *CVCʰ-.
In the case of Greek and Sanskrit, this seems to be an innovation produced independently in each language. Consider the following examples.

Root	 	PIE	 	Reflex
 	 	 	 	 
*bʰeudʰ-	 	*bʰeudʰ-e-ti	 	Skt. bódʰati
*dʰeH₁-	 	*dʰe-dʰeH₁-mi	 	Gk. títʰēmi
Tocharian too shows examples of this principle at work. Consider the examples listed below.

PIE	 	Grassmann's	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dʰoigʰ-	 	*doigʰ-	 	*dzaik-	 	A	 	Gk. teïkʰos
 	 	 	 	 	 	B tsaik-	 	Lat. fingō
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dʰegʷʰ-	 	*dgʷʰ-	 	*dzk-	 	A tsäk-	 	Skt. dah-
 	 	(Ø-grade)	 	> *dzäk-	 	B tsäk-	 	Lat. foveō
Evidently in Tocharian, as in Greek and Sanskrit, this is an independent development.

16.1.3 Palatalization

Palatalization provides one of the dominant phonological processes in the historical evolution of the Tocharian system of consonants. Through this process a consonant C acquires a palatal off-glide, denoted C'. Many and varied languages undergo a similar process. For example, we find this process at work in the history of English itself with the modern pair Eng. kin vs. chin: we find OE cynn > Eng. kin, but OE cinn > Eng. chin (incidentally, the development from PIE is *genH₁- > *gnH₁-ieH₁ > PGmc *kun-jo > OE cynn > Eng. kin, but *genu- > kinnuz > OE cinn > Eng. chin). In the latter, the front vowel i palatalizes the c, ultimately resulting in the modern sound represented by ch; in the former, this process is prevented by the back quality of OE -y- ([ü], equivalent to Modern German ü). We find the same phenomenon acting on a synchronic level when speakers of English pronounce Got you! quickly as Gotcha!

We may summarize Tocharian palatalization symbolically as follows:

 	 	*C > *C' before *e, *ē, *y, and sometimes *i, *ī.
That is, a consonant palatalizes before an immediately following front vowel or glide, except that *i, *ī only affect certain types of consonants. In particular, *i, *ī fail to palatalize bilabial, dorsal (formed with the blade of the tongue), and labiovelar consonants, as well as the sibilant *s. See the discussion of the historical evolution of PIE *i for additional discussion. Further subtlety lies in which consonants form palatalized/non-palatalized pairs. In particular, we have the following correspondences.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch Non-Palatalized	 	PToch Palatalized
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stop	 	 	 	*p	 	*p'
 	 	*t	 	 	 	*c
 	 	*d	 	 	 	*ś
 	 	*dʰ	 	 	 	*c
 	 	*ty	 	 	 	*ts
 	 	*dʰy	 	 	 	*ts
 	 	 	 	*k	 	*ś
 	 	 	 	*kʷ	 	*ś
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Affricate	 	 	 	*ts	 	*ś
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sibilant	 	 	 	*s	 	*ṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasal	 	 	 	*m	 	*m'
 	 	 	 	*n	 	*ñ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Liquid	 	 	 	*l	 	*l'
 	 	 	 	*r	 	*r'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Semivowel	 	 	 	*w	 	*w'
In the above we see that, for the most part, the particular palatalized reflex only depends on the Proto-Tocharian consonant. But notably we observe that palatalization does not treat the Indo-European dentals equally. Specifically, *d follows a treatment different from the other dentals, and moreover the palatalized reflex of dentals depends on whether or not the glide *y triggers the palatalization. We will discuss the evolution of the dentals further below.

Note also that *s has palatalized partner *ṣ, not *ś. The latter pairs with the velars, labiovelars, and affricate *ts; moreover it provides the reflex of PIE *t, *dʰ when palatalized by a following *y.

The following examples illustrate some of the above correspondences.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*t	 	*c	 	 	 	*dʰugH₂tēr	 	*täkācær	 	A ckācar	 	Ved. duhitár-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'daughter'	 	 	 	B tkā́cer	 	Gk. tʰugátēr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*l	 	*l'	 	 	 	*léuk-os	 	*l'äukæ	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'light'	 	 	 	B lyuke	 	Ved. rócas
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ty	 	*ts	 	 	 	*wleH₂nt-iH₂	 	*wlānt-yā	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'queen'	 	> *wlāntsā	 	B lāntsa	 	OIr. flaitʰ
16.1.4 Deaspiration

Deaspiration formally denotes the process by which an aspirated consonant loses the accompanying puff of air, leaving an unaspirated consonant. In Grassmann's Law, treated above, we see that at times in the course of historical evolution this process acts by changing an aspirated phoneme for its unaspirated counterpart. In Tocharian, however, the application of deaspiration was far more dramatic, ultimately removing all aspirated consonants from the Proto-Tocharian inventory. The result, therefore, is a system wherein no unaspirated consonant has an aspirated counterpart, and vice versa. Thus, in the context of Tocharian, documentary evidence only allows us to conclude that, after a certain point, aspiration no longer had any phonetic value. We cannot to date say whether or not there may have been allophonic variation in aspiration of the sort found in English: e.g. (aspirated) pot, but (unaspirated) spot.

On the phonemic level, however, way may state the rule simply:

 	 	all PIE aspirated consonants lost their aspiration in Proto-Tocharian.
The Tocharian languages display no phonemic distinction based on aspiration.

16.1.5 Devoicing

Just as drastically as deaspiration in Tocharian is the general devoicing that occurred in Proto-Tocharian:

 	 	all PIE voiced stops lost their voicing in Proto-Tocharian.
This of course carries the same caveat as that mentioned in the context of deaspiration: the loss of voicing applies on the phonemic level, though it may not apply strictly on the phonetic level. This rule applies only to the stop consonants; resonants, for example, retained their voicing. Combined with the above rule concerning deaspiration, this leads to a dramatic reduction in the stop consonant inventory of Proto-Tocharian. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*G	 	*K	 	 	 	*dʰugH₂tēr	 	*täkācær	 	A ckācar	 	Ved. duhitár-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'daughter'	 	 	 	B tkā́cer	 	Gk. tʰugátēr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*dʰgʷʰ-	 	*dzk-	 	A tsäk-	 	Skt. dah-
 	 	 	 	 	 	> *dgʷʰ-	 	> *tsäk-	 	B tsäk-	 	Lat. foveō
In the above, *G represents a general voiced stop in PIE, while *K represents the corresponding unvoiced consonant in PToch.

16.2 The Dental Series
One of the great surprises in the historical phonology of Tocharian pertains to the treatment of the dental series PIE *t, *d, *dʰ. In particular, scholars have discovered a somewhat non-uniform development, wherein PIE *d is singled out from the group and undergoes changes different from PIE *t, *dʰ. At some point early in the Proto-Tocharian period, PIE *d developed into a voiced affricate PToch *dz. This change occurs, surprisingly enough, in both palatal and non-palatal contexts. The resulting affricate subsequently obeys the laws of devoicing and palatalization, though the reflex of the latter differs from that of its brethren *t, dʰ. In particular, devoicing causes a change PToch *dz > *ts, and subsequent palatalization yields PToch *dz > *ts > *ś; by contrast, palatalization regularly derives PToch *ts from both PIE *t and PIE *dʰ.

To further complicate the situation, we find that PToch *dz is regularly lost before non-palatal vowels and PToch *æ. In addition, PIE*d itself is lost before a nasal. The following examples help illustrate the behavior of PIE *d in Tocharian.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*d	 	*dz	 	 	 	*dʰgʷʰ-	 	*dzk-	 	A tsäk-	 	Skt. dah-
 	 	 	 	 	 	> *dgʷʰ-	 	> *tsäk-	 	B tsäk-	 	Lat. foveō
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*duk-	 	*dzäk-	 	A tsäk-	 	Lat. ducere
 	 	 	 	 	 	'throw (out)'	 	 	 	B	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*d	 	*dz	 	 	 	*doru	 	*dzæru	 	A or	 	Gk. dóru
 	 	> *Ø	 	 	 	'wood' (sg.)	 	> *æru	 	B or	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dN	 	*N	 	 	 	*weid-mo-	 	*w'äimæ	 	 	 	Skt. vidmán-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'thought'	 	 	 	B ime	 	Gk. ídmōn
In the above chart, *N stands for a general nasal consonant. To further highlight the difference in treatment among the dental consonants, consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ty	 	*ts	 	 	 	*wleH₂nt-iH₂	 	*wlānt-yā	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	'queen'	 	> *wlāntsā	 	B lāntsa	 	OIr. flaitʰ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*t	 	*c	 	 	 	*dʰugH₂tēr	 	*täkācær	 	A ckācar	 	Ved. duhitár-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'daughter'	 	 	 	B tkā́cer	 	Gk. tʰugátēr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dʰ	 	*c	 	 	 	*H₁ludʰ-e-t	 	*läcä	 	A läc	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	(root aorist)	 	 	 	B lac	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*d	 	*ś	 	 	 	*déḱṃ	 	*dzäkä(n)	 	A śäk	 	Lat. decem
 	 	 	 	 	 	'ten'	 	> *śäkä	 	B śak	 	Gk. déka
16.3 The Labiovelars
The details of the evolution of the labiovelars continue to provide a forum for scholarly debate. Though the broad rules which govern how these consonants evolved seem to be clear, the data nevertheless provides some contradictory evidence. In general, a labiovelar PIE *Kʷ (representing any of *kʷ, *gʷ, *gʷʰ) obeys the following rules in the transition to Proto-Tocharian:

PIE *KʷC > PToch *kC,
PIE *Kʷ(o, a) > PToch *k(o, a),
showing loss of the labial element; but

 	 	PIE *Kʷ(i, u, Ṛ) > PToch *kʷä
showing retention of the labial element; and

 	 	PIE *Kʷ(e, ē, y) > PToch *ś(ä, æ, (y)),
demonstrating palatalization. In the above C represents any consonant and *Ṛ represents any given vocalic resonant. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*KʷC	 	*kC	 	 	 	*nokʷtew-yo	 	*nækcäw'yæ	 	A nakcu	 	Lat. noctū
 	 	 	 	 	 	'at night'	 	 	 	B nekciye	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Kʷ(o, a)	 	*k(o, a)	 	 	 	*gʷów-	 	*kæw	 	A ko	 	Skt. gáuḥ
 	 	 	 	 	 	'cow'	 	 	 	B keu	 	Gk. boũs
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Kʷ(i, u, Ṛ)	 	*kʷä	 	 	 	*gʷṃ-	 	*kʷäm	 	A kum-	 	Skt. gaccʰati
 	 	 	 	 	 	'come' (*Ø-grade)	 	 	 	B käm-	 	OE cuman
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Kʷ(e, ē, y)	 	*ś(ä, æ, (y))	 	 	 	*gʷēm-e-t	 	*śæm'ä	 	A	 	Skt. ágan
 	 	 	 	 	 	'come' (root aorist)	 	 	 	B śem	 	 
In the last two examples we see the contrast within different forms of a single root between palatalized and non-palatalized reflexes of the labiovelar. In particular, we see the labial element of PToch *kʷ reflected in the u of A kum-.

Unfortunately the data is not uniform, and we find evidence that goes against some of the above rules. For example, we also find PIE *wḷkʷo- 'wolf' > PToch *wälkwæ > B walkwe, with an unexpected sequence -kw-. Such examples might show influence from roots with like semantics and similar phonetic shape: PIE *(H₁)éḱwo- 'horse' > PToch *yäkwæ > A yuk B yakwe, where -kw- in this instance derives naturally from the palatal *ḱ followed by the labial glide *w.

16.4 Proto-Tocharian to Tocharian
For the most part, the sound (phoneme) inventory of Proto-Tocharian discussed above passes to the daughter languages rather mechanically. In some instances, however, Tocharian A and B treat Proto-Tocharian consonantal phonemes differently. We note the most salient of these differences in the following sections.

16.4.1 Proto-Tocharian to Tocharian A

A major feature of the evolution of simple consonants into Tocharian A is depalatalization. Specifically, we find PToch *w' > A w, so that Tocharian A loses the distinction between palatalized and non-palatalized variants of the bilabial glide *w.

We also find in Tocharian A a general elimination of labiovelars. That is, the labial element of the labiovelar *kʷ generally disappears, often with coloring of the adjacent vowel. This likewise applies to the sequence *kw, so that the *w falls away.

The following examples illustrate depalatalization and the loss of labiovelars.

 	 	 	 	 	 	'dog' (acc.)	 	 	 	B kweṃ	 	Goth. hunds
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*kuH-ti-	 	*kwācä	 	A kāc	 	Lat. cutis
 	 	 	 	 	 	'skin'	 	 	 	B	 	 
Several changes also affected consonant clusters in Tocharian A. The following points outline the major changes which occurred among consonant clusters:

PToch *st > A ṣt,
Internal PToch *-ks- > A -ps- and *-kṣ- > A -pṣ-,
Internal PToch *-C'y- > A -C'C'-,
Intervocalic PToch *-ns- > A -s- with palatalization of preceding vowel,
PToch *-ñc palatalizes preceding vowel.
The first two items denote simple changes affecting only the consonant cluster itself. The change *-kṣ- > A -pṣ-, however, occurs less frequently and its plausibility depends more heavily on the proposed reconstructions of the etyma involved. We also see that in Tocharian A the combination of a palatal consonant followed by *y resulted in loss of *y, with gemination (doubling) of the preceding palatal consonant. In addition, clusters involving nasals often tend to affect the preceding vowel. Specifically, not only is the nasal element of intervocalic *-ns- lost, but the preceding vowel acquires a palatal articulation. Moreover, the particular cluster *-ñc found in many nouns and the third person plural present active ending of verbs has the effect of palatalizing a preceding vowel. The palatalization applies in particular to PToch *a, ā, and *ä with the following results:

PToch *ay > A e,
PToch *āy > A e,
PToch *äy > A i,
where *y denotes palatalization of the preceding vowel. Consider the examples listed below of the above mentioned sound changes.

The Tocharian B reflexes in parentheses are analogous in function but derive from different proto-forms.

16.4.2 Proto-Tocharian to Tocharian B

In contrast to Tocharian A, which depalatalizes PToch *w', Tocharian B in fact takes the process of palatalization one step further:

 	 	PToch *w' > B y.
This minor rebellion was not enough to satisfy Tocharian B, and so the language further distinguishes itself from its sibling by conservation of labiovelars. Tocharian B shows a tendency to preserve both PToch *kʷ and PToch *kw as B kw. The rule does not apply to all situations, however. Consider the following examples.

PToch	 	Toch B	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda

 	 	 	 	 	 	*H₂eḱu-tyo-	 	*ākwätsæ	 	A	 	Lat. acūtus
 	 	 	 	 	 	'sharp'	 	 	 	B akwátse	 	OE āwel
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*kʷis-so	 	*kwäsæ	 	A kus	 	Hitt. kuis
 	 	 	 	 	 	'who'	 	 	 	B kuse	 	Gk. hós-tis
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*gʷṃ-	 	*kʷäm	 	A kum-	 	Skt. gaccʰati
 	 	 	 	 	 	'come' (*Ø-grade)	 	 	 	B käm-	 	OE cuman
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
As the last example shows, Tocharian B does not retain the labiovelar in all situations.

Tocharian B also exhibits a number of changes to consonant clusters, differing from those displayed by Tocharian A (well, by definition of course -- if they were the same changes, then we would call them Proto-Tocharian changes!). In particular we find the following major changes:

Internal PToch *-Tw- > B -TT-,
Intervocalic PToch *-mn- > B -nm-,
PToch *NS > B NtS and PToch *LS > B LtS,
Word-final PToch *-ns > B -n.
Thus, PToch *w falls away immediately following a dental consonant -- be it stop, nasal, or sibilant (all represented here by *T) -- with gemination of the preceding consonant. This rule does not apply when the sequence lies at the beginning of a word. In addition, we find metathesis of the nasals in PToch *-mn- when between vowels. We also find epenthetic insertion of -t- in Proto-Tocharian consonant sequences consisting of any nasal (*N) or liquid (*L) followed by a sibilant (*S). When word-final, we find the simplification of the sequence PToch *-ns to solely B -n. Consider the following examples.

17 Primary Case Endings: Singular
We now turn to a closer inspection of the various primary case endings one encounters in the Tocharian texts, along with their historical development. In the present section we focus on the endings of the singular.

17.1 Nominative
Simply put, the nominative case has no ending to distinguish it from other forms. We might expect this by considering, for example, thematic nouns in Proto-Indo-European with masculine nominative *-o-s and accusative *-o-m. Since PIE final consonants are lost in Tocharian, both forms result in PToch *-æ, and therefore lose any distinction. The evolution of PIE neuter nouns only serves to further reinforce this tendency, since these nouns have identical nominative and accusative even in PIE itself. In those situations in Tocharian where the oblique has acquired, or retains, a marker, we may distinguish the nominative case by the absence of this form.

17.2 Vocative
The vocative only retains in Tocharian B a form distinct from the nominative; otherwise the two cases have identical forms. In Tocharian B we distinguish three basic vocative endings, whose use is determined by the noun's nominative form:

Nominative	 	Vocative	 	Example	 	Nominative	 	Vocative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
-Ce	 	-a	 	 	 	ñakte	 	ñakta
 	 	 	 	 	 	'lord, god'	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
-C'e	 	-u	 	 	 	kaurṣe	 	kaurṣu
 	 	 	 	 	 	'bull'	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
-a	 	-ai	 	 	 	aiṣṣeñca	 	aiṣṣeñcai
 	 	 	 	 	 	'giver'	 	 
In the above C denotes an arbitrary consonant and C' an arbitrary palatalized consonant. Where palatalization is involved, the oblique may dictate the form of the vocative. Take for example the adjective B orotstse 'great', with masculine singular oblique B orocce; this has masculine singular vocative oroccu. The origin of these vocative endings remains obscure.

17.3 Oblique
As mentioned previously, for a large number of nouns the nominative and oblique are identical. This results in a situation where, for a number of nouns, no particular ending distinguishes the oblique from other cases. The most interesting and conspicuous departure from this state of affairs occurs with substantives denoting reasoning beings.

17.3.1 Oblique Ending AB -ṃ

In the Tocharian languages, despite the general lack of any morphological marker for the oblique based on grammatical classification, we find more interestingly the rise of a marker AB -ṃ /-n/ based on semantic classification. In particular, substantives which denote reasoning or rational beings employ the ending -ṃ in the oblique singular. Scholars often denote this semantic distinction by writing [+human] or [-human], but one must be careful to understand that this is shorthand: substantives characterized by [+human] may in fact be other animals being personified, or even immortal gods. Nevertheless, Tocharian seems to adhere strictly to the notion of reasoning, since e.g. animals which are not being personified do not take the ending -ṃ in the oblique, nor do e.g. other divine 'things' that do not reason. For example, A ñkät B ñakte 'divine' takes the oblique ending -ṃ when referring to the Buddha, but not when referring to the Sun or Moon.

Adjectives (when not used as a substantive) may also take the oblique ending -ṃ, without necessarily modifying a substantive that is [+human]. Tocharian A allows this ending both in the masculine and the feminine singular of adjectives of any class; Tocharian B restricts the usage of this ending to adjectives ending in B-re, -śke, -ṣke, -i and -o.

Now if we sit back and think a moment, from an Indo-European perspective the above description of the distribution of the oblique -ṃ is pretty amazing. Certainly the ending can not derive directly from the *-m which provides the accusative ending in Proto-Indo-European, since PIE final consonants are lost in Tocharian. What then might AB -ṃ derive from? We see above two major clues:

the ending -ṃ is common to adjectives, and
-ṃ has restricted use in substantives.
From the above characteristics, it would not be hard to imagine a relation to PIE *n-stems. In particular, *n-stems are well attested in the germanic family as a major adjective formation, the so-called weak adjective formation. In particular, these *n-stem adjectives are employed when the noun modified is determined, e.g. accompanied by a definite article, or when the adjective is used as a substantive: Gothic þái ana aírþái þizái gōdōn saianans 'they that are sown on the good ground' (Mark 4.20). The use of such formations pervades Germanic, but finds attestation also in other branches of IE: Latin catus 'sly' vs. Catō (genitive: Catōnis) 'the Sly One'; Greek platús 'broad' vs. Plátōn 'the Broad (Shouldered) One'.

Given the preceding observation on *n-stems outside Tocharian, we may suppose the following state of affairs. At some stage leading to Proto-Tocharian, thematic nouns and adjectives could alternately employ weak (*n-stem) or strong (non-*n-stem) inflection:

 	 	Strong Inflection	 	Weak Inflection
 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*o-s > *-æ > A -Ø B -e	 	*-o-ō(n) > *-u > AB Ø
Accusative	 	*o-m > *-æ > A -Ø B -e	 	*-o-on-ṃ > *-ænä(n) > A -aṃ B -eṃ
Strong inflection led, through phonological change, to indistinguishable nominative and accusative forms; this agreed with the situation inherited from PIE for neuters: nominative and accusative *-o-m > *-æ > A -a B -e for thematic neuters, and *-os > *-æ > A -a B -e for *s-stem neuters. Thus Tocharian speakers naturally associated strong nominal inflection with the characteristic [-human] appropriate to neuters. The final -ṃ inherited from the weak declension, by contrast, became a marker denoting [+human].

The above explanation, however, must certainly be overly simplistic and only an approximation to the true situation. But it nevertheless provides plausible motivation both for the distribution of -ṃ among nouns and for its general pervasiveness throughout the adjective classes.

17.3.2 Other Consonant Endings

We also encounter other consonant endings in the oblique case. As above, loss of the final *-m of the accusative means these typically preserve some consonant proper to the stem of the original PIE form. The two major endings preserve the *-r- and *-nt-, respectively, of original PIE *r-stem nouns and substantives in *-ent- or *-ont-. The following table provides examples of the evolution of some of these forms.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Accusative	 	*-tṛ-m	 	*-trä(n)	 	 	 	-tär
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Accusative	 	*-ont-ṃ	 	*-æntä(n)	 	-ant	 	-ent
17.3.3 Removal of the Vowel of the Nominative

In Tocharian B we find a number of nouns, both masculine and feminine, which have nominative singular ending in -C'e (-e following a palatalized consonant), but whose oblique derives from removal of the final -e. These nouns generally remain confined to classes VI.1 and V.2:

 	 	VI.1 Sg.	 	VI.1 Pl.	 	 	 	 	 	V.2 Sg.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	-iye	 	-iñ	 	 	 	 	 	-e
Accusative	 	-i	 	-iṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-Ø
This declension pattern generally follows from nouns in PIE with stems in *-éy- and *-én-, and with nominative singular forms *-ḗy and *-ḗn, respectively. Consider, for example, the forms of B maśce 'fist':

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*mustḗy	 	*mäścæ	 	maśce	 	Ved. muṣṭí-
Accusative	 	*musti-m	 	*mäścä	 	maśc	 	 
In the above we find confusion in the accusative between the éy-stem nouns and *i-stem nouns.

17.3.4 Palatalization of Suffixed Consonants

Several types of adjectives, primarily in Tocharian B, employ palatalization of a suffixed consonant to denote the masculine oblique singular. Note the following forms.

 	 	A Nom. Sg.	 	A Obl. Sg.	 	 	 	 	 	B Nom. Sg.	 	B Obl. Sg.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Ordinal	 	-te	 	-ce	 	 	 	 	 	-te	 	-ce
Adjectives	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-te	 	-ce
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-tstse	 	-cce
Privative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-tte	 	-cce
Gerundive	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-lle	 	-lye
Pret. Ptcples	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-u	 	-weṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-au	 	-oṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-au	 	-aṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Demonstratives	 	sa-, sä-	 	ca-	 	 	 	 	 	se	 	ce
In some instances this palatalization also spreads to the masculine genitive singular, as well as to the masculine plural and feminine singular. The exact origin of this palatalization remains a source of scholarly debate.

17.3.5 Oblique in A -e B -ai

The ending A -e B -ai derives from Proto-Tocharian -ai and, at least in Tocharian B, provides one of the more frequent markers of the oblique case. This ending pertains to both masculine and feminine nouns, with varied nominative forms:

 	 	Case	 	B Sg.	 	Example
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Feminine Substs.	 	Nominative	 	-a	 	aśiya
 	 	Oblique	 	-ai	 	aśiyai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Feminine Adjs.	 	N	 	-(y)a	 	astarya
 	 	Obl.	 	-ai	 	astaryai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Present Ptcple.	 	N	 	-ñca	 	 
 	 	Obl.	 	-ñcai	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Agent Noun	 	N	 	-nta	 	kauṣenta
 	 	Obl.	 	-ntai	 	kauṣentai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Feminine Abstracts	 	N	 	-o, -iye	 	prosko, proskiye
 	 	Obl.	 	-ai	 	proskai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Feminine Substs.	 	N	 	-o, -iye	 	pyāpyo
 	 	Obl.	 	-ai	 	pyāpyai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Masculine Substs.	 	N	 	-o	 	okso
 	 	Obl.	 	-ai	 	oksai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Feminine Substs.	 	N	 	-yo, -ya	 	wertsiya, wertsyo
 	 	Obl.	 	-ai	 	wertsyai
Because of the pervasiveness of the ending A -e in Tocharian A, it is difficult to discern exactly when this ending corresponds to the oblique singular B -ai in Tocharian B. We do find one example which appears more or less certain: A kli 'woman', with oblique singular kule; cf. B klyiye, with oblique singular klai. In general the ending -ai undoubtedly derives from many sources; however the details of the development remain a subject of scholarly debate.

17.3.6 Oblique in B -o, -a

This category comprises a smaller number of substantives within Tocharian B. In particular, only two feminine nouns -- B śana 'woman, wife' and lāntsa 'queen' -- show the oblique ending -o. A small group of nouns both masculine and feminine employ the oblique ending -a. In the former group, the particular combination of nominative and oblique endings derives from the interplay between the position of the PIE accent and the grade of a thematic suffix containing a laryngeal; in the latter group, secondary reformation may have occurred to distinguish what would otherwise have been identical nominative and oblique forms:

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*gʷén-H₂	 	*śänā	 	śana	 	Gk. gunē
Accusative	 	*gʷen-éH₂-	 	*śänå	 	śano	 	Ved. jáni
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	*ǵṇdʰweH₂	 	*käntwå	 	kantwo	 	Lat. dingua
Acc.	 	*ǵṇdʰweH₂-m	 	*käntwå	 	*kantwo > kantwa	 	Got. tuggo
The reformation of the oblique form may have patterned after oblique forms in -ai. Note in the last example that we find metathesis of PIE *dṇǵʰweH₂ to *ǵṇdʰweH₂.

17.4 Genitive
17.4.1 Peculiar Genitive Endings

The Tocharian languages display a small number of genitive singular endings which are particularly peculiar from a Proto-Indo-European standpoint. The first of these endings, A -Ø B -e, is remarkable because, despite deriving from by far the most common genitive ending in PIE, it survives only in a very limited number of Tocharian nouns. In particular, it remains in certain adjectives with stem *-ent-/*-ont-, and in the lone familial noun B tkācer 'daughter'.

The second of these endings, AB -i, bears note because its historical development remains a bit of a mystery. Scholars continue to debate its origin, but one proposal suggests a likely source lies in the Proto-Indo-European dative case, formed on top of a genitive ending (Pinault 2008). It occurs only with personal nouns, in particular the remaining familial nouns, personal pronouns and demonstratives, and proper nouns borrowed from Sanskrit with nominative singular in -e.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*dʰugH₂tēr	 	*täkācær	 	ckācar	 	tkācer	 	Gk. tʰugátēr
Genitive	 	*dʰugH₂tr-ós	 	*täkātræ	 	 	 	tkātre	 	Got. dauhtar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	*gʷén-H₂	 	*śänā	 	śäṃ	 	śana	 	Gk. gunē
Gen.	 	*gʷen-éH₂-s+ey	 	*śänå+'äy	 	 	 	*śänó+i > śnoy	 	Ved. jáni
We further find genitive singular endings A -i B -ñ in certain nouns borrowed from Sanskrit. The origin of these endings is less well understood than those treated above.

17.4.2 Productive Endings

The most productive genitive singular endings on a synchronic level are A -s B -ntse. As with the -ṃ of the accusative, the origin of the genitive A -s B -ntse most likely lies in PIE *n-stem nouns (Pinault 2008). In particular, it appears that *n-stem nouns with nominative-accusative in *-ṇ and genitive *-en-s, where the *-e- formed part of the suffix, incurred a secondary genitive formation, *-ens-os, on top of that already in place. This likewise occurred in the weak formation of thematic nouns (see the discussion of oblique -ṃ above): the typical genitive *-o-n-os was remodeled as *-ons-os. In the Proto-Tocharian period, the ensuing *-onsos > *-ænsæ was further reanalyzed as *-æ-nsæ, since the *-æ- agreed with the accusative of the strong declension of thematic nouns (cf. *yäkwæ). This of course falls in line with the general Tocharian tendency to build secondary cases using postpositions appended to the oblique (accusative). This last ending, *-nsæ, then follows regular sound changes to yield A -s (due to loss of final vowels and the simplification *-ns > A -s in Tocharian A) and -ntse (due to the insertion of -t- between *-ns- in Tocharian B). Consider the following examples.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*stH₂-mṇ	 	*stāmä(n)	 	stām	 	Lat. stāmen
Accusative	 	*stH₂-mén-s+os	 	*stām-änsæ	 	stām-ántse	 	Ved. stʰā́man-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	*H₁éḱw-o-s	 	*yäkwæ	 	yakwe	 	Lat. equus
Acc.	 	*H₁éḱw-o-ón-s+os	 	*yäkwæ-nsæ	 	yäkwé-ntse	 	Gk. híppos
In the above chart, PIE *stH₂-mṇ illustrates the *n-stem nouns, in this instance with a reformed genitive. We see the parallel with the weak declension of *H₁éḱw- in the genitive, which is also reformed and further reanalyzed as an ending appended to the accusative.

We also find the productive endings A -āp, -yāp B -epi for the genitive singular. These generally pertain to masculine adjectives and participles, and in Tocharian A also to substantives characterized as [+human]. These endings likely show the adoption of a genitive ending first occurring among the demonstrative pronouns. In particular, the labial element perhaps derives from an archaic thematic dative: PIE *te-smoy > *cäzβu > *cä-βä. The final element *-βä is appended in Tocharian A to *-yā-, perhaps a reflex of feminine *-iH₂; in Tocharian B the pronoun further inherits another dative marker, *cä-β-i > B cwi, cpi, and the element -pi is imported into adjectives and participles.

18 Adjective Class II: Athematic *n-Stems
Class II comprises athematic adjectives deriving from original PIE *n-stems. As we have seen in the discussion of the oblique singular ending -ṃ, Tocharian has employed a number of *n-stem formations throughout its evolution. It should therefore come as no surprise that a number of adjectives fall into Class II. As exemplar we take A klyom B klyomo 'noble'. The forms are given below.

Obl.	 	klyomäñcäs	 	klyominās	 	 	 	 	 	klyomoṃ	 	klyomñana
We see in the Tocharian A masculine genitive and oblique forms the vestiges of a formation in *-nt-, and likewise in the masculine oblique singular of Tocharian B. Apart from these forms, the paradigm clearly shows the influence of the *n-stems. The nominative reflects PIE *ḱléu-mō(n), with cognates Got. hliuma 'hearing', ON hljómr 'sound', Skt. śrutá- 'heard, famous', Gk. klutós 'renowned'. The development of the form involves umlaut: *ḱléu-mō(n) > *klyäumõ > *klyumo > *klyomo (umlaut) > A klyom B klyomo. The final -o of the Tocharian B masculine nominative singular has spread to other cases, replacing the expected vocalism of the *n-stem forms:

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	B Expected	 	B Actual
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Genitive	 	*-mṇ-s-os	 	*-mänsæ	 	*-mäntse	 	-montse
Accusative	 	*-mon-ṃ	 	*-mæn	 	*-meṃ	 	-moṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*-mōn-es	 	*-māñä	 	*-māñ	 	-moñ
This replacement even changes the vowel of the typical -epi of the genitive ending.

19 Present Thematic Classes
As the name implies, the verbs of the present thematic classes insert the theme, or thematic vowel, PIE *-e / o- between root and ending. In particular, the first person forms (both singular and plural), as well as the third person plural (not singular), show *o-grade of the thematic vowel; the remaining forms show *e-grade. The following chart lists the PIE combinations of thematic vowel and ending that led to the Proto-Tocharian forms.

The apostrophe denotes palatalization of the preceding consonant. One immediately notices the most salient feature of thematic conjugations: where PIE originally has the theme *-e-, the change PIE *e > PToch *'ä often results in vowel loss; but palatalization of the preceding consonant remains. That is, the lasting effect of the PIE theme *-e- is Tocharian palatalization of the consonant preceding the ending.

1st Person Singular Active: The theme vowel of the first person singular is PIE *-o-, but the endings are heterogeneous between the two Tocharian languages. Tocharian A derives the form from the ending *-mi, importing the athematic ending into the thematic conjugation. Such reformation of the first person singular is found outside of Tocharian as well, e.g. Skt. bʰarāmi 'I bear'. Tocharian B, by contrast, does not use the athematic ending, but rather employs the usual thematic ending. Not content to stop there, Tocharian B moreover adds the morpheme *-u. Its origin is uncertain, though perhaps it derives from *-wi, possibly harkening back to the -vī found in Latin perfects: e.g. clamāvī 'I cried'.

2nd Person Singular Active: Interestingly, only this active form agrees between the two languages. The derivation follows regular sound rules; the only difficulty being the loss of the final *-ā# > B -a#, which normall should remain in Tocharian B.

3rd Person Singular Active: This form shows the most marked difference between the two languages, and the most notable departure from PIE. The general loss of final consonants in Tocharian implies that such forms must have been analyzed at some point as a phrasal unit with a following adverbial or other part of speech, or with some other suffix which differed between the two languages. If in fact these endings derive from the addition of some enclitic elements, the most likely candidates are the sentence connectives PIE *se and *nu 'now'. In particular the meaning of the latter stands in accord with the fact that this ending only appears in the non-past formation.

1st Person Plural Active: The first person plural active ending is almost as problematic in PIE as in Tocharian. The only certain element is PIE *-m-, since Lat. -mus, Gk. -mes (Doric), and Vedic -mā (occasionally alternating with -ma) all leave the vowel, grade, and terminal element in doubt. It is no wonder then that Tocharian A and B differ on precisely these grounds. Given the Vedic form -masi and its resemblance to Gk. -mes, it is tempting to take the PIE form as *-mesi. This provides a plausible antecedent of A -mäs, but would require that PIE *i not palatalize the preceding PIE *-s-, otherwise atypical in Tocharian. Moreover, if the antecedent of the Tocharian B form is PIE *-mō, this requires that PIE *ō develop into PToch *-o, which, though possible, is generally restricted to the environment PIE *-ōn#.

2nd Person Plural Active: The two languages diverge on this form. Tocharian B shows a lengthened grade of the vowel, necessary to explain both the palatalization and that fact that the vowel itself is retained.

3rd Person Plural Active: The third person plural endings follow normal phonological evolution. The Tocharian A form results in -eñc < *-añc due to palatalization of the vowel in the environment of a cluster of palatalized consonants. The Tocharian A form derives from the PIE primary (non-past) ending *-nti, while that of Tocharian B derives from the original secondary ending *-nt.

1st Person Singular Mediopassive: This ending is a composite structure. The most salient element is the the PIE *-r-, a marker which in general characterizes the entire mediopassive paradigm in PIE, cf. Lat. orior 'I rise'. Tocharian shows also the element *-h₂, the PIE primary thematic active ending of the first person singular, and further preposes the secondary ending *-m. The final *-i is likely again the deictic particle encountered in the active endings. Greek shows a similar structure, e.g. Gk. pʰér-o-mai < PIE pʰér-o-mh₂i, differing from Tocharian only in the zero grade of the ending, and lack of the mediopassive marker *-r. The thematic vowel often drops in Tocharian A forms. The change B *-mār > -mar results from the accent falling on root or stem, leaving the vowel of the ending unaccented.

2nd Person Singular Mediopassive: This ending essentially recapitulates the active ending, merely adding the mediopassive marker *-r and the deictic *-i.

3rd Person Singular Mediopassive: Whereas Latin shows an *o-grade in the third person mediopassive ending (*-tor > Lat. -tur), Tocharian shows a zero grade followed by the mediopassive marker *- and the deictic *-i.

1st Person Plural Mediopassive: This reflects the personal ending found in, e.g., Gk. -metʰa and Vedic -mahi, augmented by the mediopassive *-r and deictic *-i.

2nd Person Plural Mediopassive: This ending proves difficult to explain. Both Tocharian A and B forms show the presence of the mediopassive *-r and deictic *-i which pervade the entire mediopassive paradigm. In other regards the two languages diverge. The Tocharian A form likely results from a PIE ending -dʰ(w)e, as found in Greek -s-tʰe. The Tocharian B form, however, lacking palatalization must result from a variant such as PIE *-dʰuwe, as found in e.g. Hitt. -duma < *-duwa. If so, then the form likely developed as PIE *-dʰuwe > PToch *-täw'ä > B *-täyä > -tä, with the last step following from contraction.

3rd Person Plural Mediopassive: This form parallels the singular, and whereas Latin has again the *o-grade *-ntor > Lat. -ntur, Tocharian once more shows a zero grade.

19.1 Present Class II
CLASS II presents follow a root thematic present formation. That is, CLASS II presents begin with the root, add the thematic vowel, then the endings. As such, they form the backbone of the majority of the thematic present conjugations. Of course this characterization must be viewed in Proto-Indo-European terms, and so strictly applies to those roots in the class which may be traced back to PIE heritage; the class then extended by analogy within Tocharian itself. In general the roots of this class show PIE full grade, *CéC-. Compare AB pär- 'bear' with its Indo-European cousins.

Neither PToch *p nor *r are subject to palatalization (or, they were palatalized and regularly depalatalized), and so the forms of this particular verb do not show the effects of the thematic vowel in Tocharian.

The structure of CLASS II also forms the basis for other thematic classes, in particular the present classes in *-se / o- and *-ske / o-.

The paradigm of AB āk- < PIE *h₂eǵ- 'lead' serves to illustrate the active forms of CLASS II verbs; A klyos- B klyaus- < PIE *kleus- 'hear' illustrate the mediopassive forms.

Note that the interplay of the accent and the weak vowel *ä often result in a lack of thematic vowel between root and ending in the final Tocharian form. The palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only remnant of the original vowel.

19.2 Present Classes III & IV
Though CLASS III and CLASS IV presents are thematic, several features distinguish them from other present classes. In particular, the verbs of both classes are deponent, that is, the presents exhibit only mediopassive forms. Moreover the thematic vowel shows differences from other thematic classes, in many respects suggesting a thoroughgoing *o-vocalism throughout the paradigm, rather than the *e / o alternation of the other thematic classes. The verb AB mäsk- 'be located, be' illustrates the forms of CLASS III.

Several plausible explanations exist for the formation of CLASS III and CLASS IV presents, and scholarly opinion to date lacks complete consensus.

One line of reasoning, set forth in Adams (1988), concerns the most archaic PIE forms of the middle voice. In particular, some evidence suggests that the most archaic form of the third person singular mediopassive ending was PIE *-o, in the plural *-ro. This, combined with the deictic *-, apparently forms the basis for the Sanskrit forms duhé < PIE *dʰugʰó + i and duhré < PIE *dʰugʰró + i. Though an archaic formation within PIE itself, the Tocharian B forms ste (3 sg.) < PIE stH₂ó, stare < PIE *stH₂ró support the possibility of this formation surviving into the documented Tocharian languages. The fact that the ending was archaic in PIE, however, may have led to its being augmented by the athematic mediopassive endings. This, combined with a generalization of the *-o- as thematic vowel throughout the mediopassive paradigm when the root showed no alternation with an active present, may have ultimately led to a present conjugation characterized by thematic *-o- through, and the more usual mediopassive endings. The change PIE *o > PToch *æ would then explain the thematic vowels of CLASS III in Tocharian A and B. CLASS IV might then be explained by a process of rounding: those roots with Proto-Tocharian root vowel *-ā- undergo a shift *(C)ā(C)æ- > *(C)å(C)å-.

Another possibility (Pinault, notes 2006) invokes the process of contraction. In particular, as many of the verbs of CLASS IV are synchronically denominatives, one might seek an origin in the denominative suffix PIE *-eh₂-, possibly followed by PIE *-ye / o-. The compound suffix then undergoes contraction across the *-y-, a process found elsewhere, e.g. PIE *tréyes > PToch *träyä > *træ+i > A tre B trai. This process does not appear to occur finally, but only in initial and intermediate syllables.

19.3 Present Class VIII
CLASS VIII presents comprise the so-called sigmatic presents. That is, these verbs append -s- to the verbal root, followed by the thematic vowel: PIE *-se / o-. The thematic vowel of course causes palatalization of the preceding *-s- in the expected positions. The forms of A ar- B er- 'evoke' < PIE *h₁or- (cf. Gk. órnūmi 'urge, incite', Lat. orior 'rise', Skt. ṛṇóti 'raises', Hitt. arāi 'rises') serve to illustrate the paradigm.

The third person singular form in Tocharian A results from a regular simplification: A *arṣä-ṣ > *arṣṣ > *arṣ > aräṣ (a change also reflected in the third person singular present of 'to be': *naṣäṣ > A naṣ). The geminate consonant remains in the form with suffixed personal pronoun.

One generally finds that in verbs where stem-final *-se- becomes *-ṣ(ä)-, this palatalized *-ṣ- subsequently depalatalizes upon contact with a following -tV-, i.e. an ending containing t followed by a vowel. This is a regular, apparently morphologically conditioned phonetic change, and the striking point is that this does not occur in the Tocharian B mediopassive paradigm above: B -ṣ- is retained in the second and third person forms, in keeping with the remainder of the paradigm. Compare CLASS IX, where this change does occur.

The linguist of course wonders: what is the origin of the *-s- formation in the Tocharian present? The basic fact is that to date the origin remains elusive. Scholars typically discuss the sigmatic presents in conjunction with presents in *-sḱ-, which they view for the most part as causative formations within Tocharian. The *-s- also frequently denotes a causative, more so in Tocharian A, where the *-sḱ- formation has all but disappeared. The difficulty in associating the *-s- extension with an original causative lies in the fact that no such causative formation exists in Indo-European outside of Tocharian.

Of course sigmatic formations abound elsewhere in Indo-European. Some scholars link the Tocharian formation with original sigmatic aorists in PIE, in particular with aorist subjunctives. There are two primary difficulties with such a theory: (1) these aorists generally show full grade of the root, whereas the Tocharian presents show zero grade; (2) the PIE cognates of Tocharian *s-presents generally show root aorists, rather than *s-aorists. Other scholars propose linking the Tocharian formation with sigmatic presents found in Greek, as in e.g. Gk. aéksō 'increase, make grow' and dépsō 'knead, soften'. Again difficulties arise: (1) as above, the Greek forms show full grade, while the Tocharian forms derive from zero grade; (2) the verb A ok- B auks- 'sprout, grow up' is the only cognate of an IE sigmatic present (cf. Gk. aéksō; Skt. vakṣáyati 'makes grow', but perfect vavakṣa 'grew'; ON vexa 'make grow', but vaxa 'grow'; Goth. wahsjan 'grow'; OE weaxan 'wax, grow'), but has present A oksis- B auks-äsk-. Contary to expectation, the *-s- appended immediately to the root does not appear to have a causative function across the IE cognates; moreover, this holds equally true in Tocharian, as evidenced by the secondary suffix applied after the *-s-. The Tocharian form is in fact not causative, cf. B ostn=auksäṣṣäṃ 'he grows up at home' (121a1).

19.4 Present Class IX
CLASS IX presents, extant only in Tocharian B, employ the suffix *-sḱ- followed by the thematic vowel: PIE *-sḱ-e / o- > -ṣṣ(ä)- / -skæ-. Where the thematic vowel was originally *-o-, the cluster *-sk- remains intact; where the thematic vowel was *-e-, the cluster *-sk- palatalizes as *-ṣṣ-. Though the class contains predominantly causative verbs, some non-causatives likewise pertain to this formation. The verb B kälp- 'attain' illustrates the paradigm.

Pres. Ppl.	 	kälpāskemane	 	kalpäskemane
The etymology of B kälp- remains uncertain, though it perhaps derives from the root PIE *kelp- found in Old English helma 'rudder, tiller' and hielfe 'handle'. The verb retains another formation based on the roots with final laryngeal, showing a CLASS VI present A kälp-n-ā-tär and Class I preterite A kälpāt B kälpāte. This construction is reflected in the non-causative stem *kälp-ā-sk-, whereas the causative stem derives from *kälp-äsk-.

The paradigm also illustrates the phonetic rule mentioned in the context of CLASS VIII (the latter notable because of the rule's absence): the palatalized suffix -ṣṣ(ä)- is depalatalized preceding -tV, i.e. an ending beginning with -t- followed by a vowel. Thus depalatalized kälpāstär and kalpästär, where by contrast CLASS VIII shows the palatalized erṣtär. Interestingly, this rule does not apply when the *-sk- is no longer felt as a suffix, but as part of the root itself. Consider for example ñäsk- 'demand, require; (med.) seek' < PIE *nes-sḱe / o- < *nes- 'move (back) toward a good position/state' (cf. Gk. néomai 'return home', Skt. násate 'unite with, approach', OE genesen 'save'): CLASS II present mediopassive 3rd sg. ñaṣtär, pl. ñaskentär. (In Tocharian A, the cluster *-st- does not appear; one only encounters -ṣt-.) Thus this phonetic rule is not only sensitive to the phonological environment, but to the morphological environment as well.

A point of critical importance surrounds the vocalization of the vowel *-ä- inserted through anaptyxis between the root and *-sk- suffix. This joining vowel appears variously as the reduced -ä- and the full -a-. When the former occurs, the ä of the root strengthens to a; when the latter, the root vowel remains in the reduced form. This alternation betokens a shift in the position of the accent: in Tocharian B the accent shifts to the first syllable in causative verb forms, while it remains further to the rigth in non-causative forms. This provides a very important distinction between causative and non-causative, since even non-causatives can employ the *-sk- suffix: B ai- 'give', with 1st sg. aiskau, 3rd aiṣṣäṃ; we- 'speak', with 1st sg. weskau, 3rd weṣṣäṃ. Thus the shift in accent is the only strict marker of causative forms, accompanied by initial palatalization.

19.5 Present Class X
CLASS X presents show an extension by *-sk- of verbs with nasal present stems: *-nā+sk-, or *-n+sk- with anaptyxis, yielding A -nās-/-näs- B -nāsk-/-näsk-. Both causative and non-causative verbs belong to this class. The verb täm- 'be born, (caus.) beget' illustrates the paradigm.

The verbal stems derive from *täm-näsk- > A *tämnäs- B *tänmäsk-, where the cluster -mn- undergoes metathesis in Tocharian B. Note also the simplification in the third person singular active of Tocharian A: *tämnäṣäṣ > A tämnäṣ (cf. A aräṣ in CLASS VIII). The Tocharian B forms, when causative, shift the accent forward to the initial syllable, as with the presents in simple *-sk-: causative third singular active tanmäṣṣäṃ, mediopassive tanmästär.

Three verbs of CLASS VIII -- näk- 'destroy'; päk- 'bring to maturity, cook'; tsäk- 'incinerate, burn (trans.)' -- have in Tocharian A special intransitive formation employing mediopassive forms of CLASS X. For example, tsäk- has active third person singular tskäṣ 'incinerates, makes burn' < *tsäkṣä-ṣ (cf. B tsakṣäṃ), with corresponding intransitive tsäknäṣtär 'is burning, is on fire'. Similarly, näknäṣtär 'dies' and päknäṣtär 'matures, cooks (intrans.)'.

19.6 Present Class XI
CLASS XI presents also employ the *-sk- extension, but applied to sigmatic stems of the sort encountered in CLASS VIII. The root extension therefore becomes *-säsk- > A -sis- B -sask-/-säsk- (note the vowel in the Tocharian A suffix). The verb AB āks- < PIE *H₁ǵ-s- 'say' (cf. Lat. aiō 'I say, affirm' and adagium 'proverb'; Gk. ẽ 'he said' < *H₁ēǵt, with reformed present ẽmi) illustrates the paradigm.

Tocharian A exhibits few CLASS XI forms, and the -i- of the suffix is difficult to explain. It perhaps reflects a simple phonological change of -ä- to -i- between sibilants. Possibly arguing against this is the form A eṃtsäṣtär of the verb A ents- 'grasp', related to B eṅk- and perhaps derived from PIE *H₁neḱ-; cf. Skt. a'nóti 'reaches, gets' and Gk. enegkeĩn < *H₁neH1ṅke / o-, suppletive aorist to pʰérein 'carry'. Compare also A swāsäsmāṃ (mediopassive) B swāsäṣṣenca (active), from *swā-s-(ä)sk- 'make rain'.

19.7 Present Class XII
CLASS XII presents show a suffix -(ä)ññ-, and comprise both primary and denominative verbs. The suffix has two likely origins: *-n-ye / o-, a denominative based on a root with final *-n; and *-ṇ(H)-ye / o-, a deverbative based on a nasal present formation. This latter formation parallels that of the *-nāsk- class. One finds a similar interplay between denominative and deverbative constructions in Sanskrit: gṛbʰāyáti vs. gṛbʰṇā́ti, both from the root grabʰ- 'grab'. The verbs A śew- 'yawn' and B mänt- 'injure' illustrate the paradigm.

Note the depalatalization of the *(ä)ññ-suffix before endings in -tV, as encountered in in CLASS IX, and notably absent in CLASS VIII.

CLASS XII marks the only surviving, productive class of denominatives in Tocharian. Consider, for example, the noun A tuṅk B taṅkw 'love': compare the present participles A tuṅkiññant B täṅwaññenca '(the one) loving' from *tänkw-äññ- 'to love'. Similarly the verb B lare-ññ- 'to cherish' from the adjective B lare 'dear'. CLASS XII is not restricted however to denominatives, showing forms derived from primary verbal roots: B arcantär from the root ārc-äññ-, based on ārc- 'have to, must'; similarly mänt- 'injure' above.

20 Nominative & Oblique
20.1 The Nominative Case
We distinguish three basic uses of the nominative case in Tocharian. The first and principal usage is to denote the grammatical subject of a finite verb form, in the same way that in English we distinguish I from me: only the former, the nominative form, can represent the grammatical subject of a verb.

The second principal use is as predicate nominative, generally in conjunction with an infinitive. That is, the infinitive and the noun in the nominative case are equated to one another, generally via a copula, whether explicit or implied. Consider the following examples, with bold typeface denoting the noun in the nominative and with italic typeface denoting the infinitive:

A wsā-yok-yats... sūk lkātsi 'gold-colored skin... (is) pleasant to look at': here we see what in classical Greek or Latin might be termed an instance of an epexegetical infinitive, an infinitive qualifying a noun or adjective. In particular, the fact that the infinitive does not distinguish active or middle voice allows the nominative to function also as logical object of the verb: we have simultaneously [X] is good and look at [X]. We could equivalently translate 'gold-colored skin... (is) pleasant to be seen'.
B ṣale tapre murtaṣe olaṅk nai ṅke raṅkatsi 'the high mountain of exaltation (is) thus indeed to be climbed easily': this parallels the above construction.
B kleśänmaṣṣi sañi ṣek krämtsi preke '(it is) time (for) the troublesome enemies perpetually to be hindered': this construction requires more delicate analysis. Strictly, the clause equates kleśänmaṣṣi sañi 'pertaining-to-afflictions enemies' and preke 'time', both nominative; but the sense actually predicates preke to the noun-verb phrase as a whole: 'it is time (that) troublesome enemies (are) perpetually to be hindered'.
The third major use of the nominative is adverbial. In particular, the nominative masculine singular of an adjective may function as an adverb with cognate meaning. In other classical languages such as Greek, Latin or Sanskrit, one employs the neuter accusative; the Tocharian usage of the nominative derives from the coalescence of masculine and neuter in the singular, and from the identity of nominative and accusative in the neuter. The Tocharian form employs a neuter substantive, as discussed in the first lesson.

20.2 The Oblique Case
The oblique case serves many and varied roles within Tocharian. Chief among these, and the major point of departure from the accusative of other ancient IE languages, is as base of the secondary cases. That is, Tocharian forms the secondary cases of nouns by appending suffixes to the oblique form of the noun, either singular or plural according to context. This analysis of secondary cases particularly comes to the fore in group inflection, where one secondary case ending governs a string of nominals in the oblique. In particular, many prepositions and postpositions govern nouns in the oblique.

The remaining functions of the oblique case in Tocharian by and large parallel its uses in other ancient Indo-European languages. We identify the following major uses:

Direct Object: the oblique serves to denote the direct object of a verb. For example, A opyāc käl- B epiyac käl- 'bring memory', i.e. 'remember'.
Internal Object: the internal object of a verb (or a figura etymologica) employs the oblique case. For example, A ytār i- B ytāri i- 'go the going' or 'go/travel the path'; B prāśśäṃ prek- 'ask a question'; A wles wles- B lāṃs lāṃs- 'do a deed'.
Periphrastic Constructions: a verb together with a noun in the oblique may provide an alternate construction for certain verbal notions. For example, A opyāc käl- B epiyac käl- 'bring memory' provides a periphrastic construction for 'remember'; A yark yām- B yarke yām- 'do reverence' becomes 'to honor'.
Extent in Time: a nominal expression in the oblique may express the time during, throughout, or over which something occurs. For example, A tāṃ praṣt B cau preke 'at the time'; A tricäṃ koṃ B trice kauṃ 'on the third day'; A ārts koṃ B artsa kauṃ 'day by day', 'daily'.
Extent in Space: a nominal expression in the oblique may express the distance over which or direction toward which something occurs. For example, A päñ kursärwā B piś kwärsarwa 'five miles wide'; A koṃ-pärkāñcāṃ kälyme riyis 'east of the city' (literally 'toward the sun-rising direction of the city').
Manner: a nominal expression in the oblique may express manner, as in B tarya lykwarwa 'three times', i.e. 'thrice'.
Destination, Goal, or Purpose: The oblique may denote the destination of directed motion: B ost i- 'go into the house'; B wertsiyai yaṃ 'he goes to assembly'; B oskai wayāte-ne 'he led her into the house'. This destination may be a physical goal or a metaphysical one: A särkaṣi wraṣäl yowäs 'he came upon a sick feeling'. Tocharian may also employ the locative or allative cases in such situations.
Person Addressed: occasionally the person addressed takes the oblique: A weñā-ṃ B weñā-ne 'spoke to him'; B Bramñikte toyna weña 'the god Brahma spoke to them'; A arṣäntāṃ träṅkiñc 'they speak to the ... provoking'. This usage is rare, as the Tocharian languages generally employ the allative in this role.
Distributive Compounds: Tocharian employs the oblique in reduplicated compounds with a distributive role: A koṃ-koṃ B kauṃ-kauṃ 'day by day'; A waṣta-waṣt B ostä-ostä (ostw-ostä) 'house by house'.

Syntax
Syntax most broadly treats the system by which the speaker constructs an utterance. Under the rubric of utterance we would include the sentence as a linguistic unit of central importance; but syntax also hopes to explain the principles underlying the use of other elements such as interjections or exclamations as well. Syntax therefore casts a wide net, and many subcategories of the study of language fall within its purview. For example, the study of morphology touches upon syntax, since many inflected languages employ affixes that encode syntactic information: e.g. the case system of early Indo-European languages. Thus, whereas say phonology can be studied more or less independently of other facets of the system of a given language, syntax depends in a crucial way on several other features of that system. Because of this complexity, what linguists mean by the term 'syntax' has often varied over the history of linguistic inquiry, and in particular over the history of Indo-European studies.

Diachronic syntax denotes the study of changes in syntactic principles in a language or language family through time. Diachronic syntax seeks to shed light on the syntax of a language at a given point in time by studying the syntax of the language at an earlier point of time and outlining certain broad principles of change that not only explain the syntactic evolution in the language under consideration, but possibly also in other languages. This forms a primary pillar of IE studies, though it has received far less attention than the other pillars of historical phonology and morphology. In some sense this comes by necessity; for instance we could not hope to say anything cogent about the development of IE syntax without first having some definitive notions of the development of IE morphology, since the former depends quite intricately on the latter. The earliest studies of IE syntax from the 19th century therefore concerned themselves primarily with a description of various morphological forms and their manners of occurrence within utterances.

Because of the complexity of syntactic investigation, as well as shifting notions of just what that study comprises, the study of PIE historical syntax has enjoyed heated debate among scholars and continues to be a rich area of inquiry.

Word Order
Word order in a larger or more restricted sense has long been a focus for PIE syntactic studies. At times this results from the assertion that it affords a unifying organizational principle for many other syntactic structures; at other times from the assertion that word order has been afforded too much prominence. The forcefulness of the debate generally ensures that focus remains on word order.

In the larger sense word order refers to the order of the principal elements Subject, Object, and Verb in a (usually simple, declarative) sentence: SVO, SOV, VSO, etc. Scholars often restrict attention to the relative ordering of object and verb: VO or OV. Thus certain lines of syntactic investigation seek to understand whether typical word order in PIE is VO or OV, i.e. whether the verb typically precedes or follows its object.

We must ask: how would one go about determining this ordering for PIE? Certainly we must compare sentences across IE languages, focusing on the relative ordering of these elements. Moreover, even a cursory look at the history of English shows that such patterns can change within a language (Modern English generally exhibits SVO order, while Old English generally SOV). We must therefore take care to compare only the most archaic syntactic patterns among the IE languages. We must therefore give precedence to languages such as Hittite and Vedic Sanskrit because of their overall antiquity; and e.g. to archaic Latin rather than Classical Latin because of its greater proximity to the time period which we wish to study. Based on examples such as the following (Fortson 2004)

Hittite	 	nu=za MUSilluyankas DIM-an tarahta
 	 	And the serpent overcame the stormgod.
 	 	 
Vedic	 	maruto ha enam na ajahuḥ
 	 	Indeed the Maruts did not abandon him.
 	 	 
Latin	 	Eumolpus tamquam litterārum stūdiōsus utīque ātrāmentum habet
 	 	Eumolpus, so interested in learning, surely has (some) ink.
 	 	 
Runic	 	ek hlewagastiz holtijaz horna tawido
 	 	I, Hlewagastiz of Holt, made (this) horn.
 	 	 
Tocharian A	 	kāsu ñom-klyu tsraṣiśśi śäk kälymentwaṃ säkatär
 	 	Good fame of the strong spreads out in ten directions.
scholars generally agree that PIE itself likely exhibited verb-final word order.

Now one point of contention is what exactly it means to say that PIE exhibits verb-final, or OV, word order. Certainly it should not mean that it only places the verb at the end of a simple sentence: even Hittite, perhaps the most rigidly verb-final among the early IE languages, occasionally puts the verb at the beginning of an utterance. Typically this highlights the verb relative to the other elements of the sentence. If Hittite can show such variation, and if the other early IE languages are even more flexible, then certainly PIE should not be taken to be rigidly OV.

We should mention one important issue. Linguists would say in this context that OV is the unmarked word order, and any departure from that would be marked. By 'marked' we mean that the departure alone from the unmarked order itself carries extra content. We must be careful, as Watkins (1976) points out, not to confuse 'unmarked' with 'normal', or 'marked' with 'abnormal'. Linguists would treat both marked and unmarked usages as normal, each being appropriate for different contexts.

Another subtle question arises: how do we know the above examples don't merely represent several independent developments toward a fairly common word order? That is, how do we know the above examples tell us anything specific about the actual word order in PIE itself? These sentences don't even have the same words! We will return to this issue below.

What are the benefits of assigning any predetermined word order to PIE at all? The word order of Classical Greek and Latin, for example, is relatively free; we might therefore suppose this state of affairs for PIE. As a consequence, this would force us to explain the fairly rigid verb-final syntax of Hittite as an innovation. But free word order would also require us to explain many other features of early IE languages that do seem to show a preferential order. For example, genitive modifiers generally precede the nouns they modify in cognate phrases across IE languages (Clackson 2007):

PIE	 	Sanskrit	 	Greek	 	Analysis
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*dems potis	 	dám pati-	 	déspotis	 	of-the-house master
As it turns out, OV languages typically place genitives before the noun they modify. That is, OV structure typically implies Genitive-Head order in noun phrases. We should not interpret this too strictly: the variation exhibited by the daughter languages suggests this was likely not an iron-clad rule in PIE. But what it does provide is a systematic way of evaluating the plausibility of syntactic structures proposed for PIE (Lehmann 1993): so-called typological statements such as 'OV structure implies Genitive-Head order in noun phrases' recapitulate data garnered from modern languages across the globe. Thus the assertion that PIE is verb-final and genitives precede their head nouns would say that, from a present-day perspective, PIE is in these respects a very typical language.

Subordination
The earliest statements on subordination in PIE asserted that it did not exist as such. That is, PIE supposedly employed a paratactic structure, setting grammatically independent sentences beside one another and essentially employing context to suggest that one clause provided a precondition, or attendant circumstance, for the other. From this evidently developed subordination, or hypotaxis, by interpreting the clause denoting the attendant circumstances as part of the other clause. We may provide a caricature of the process employing Modern English:

 	 	Parataxis	 	Hypotaxis
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Who loves you? I saw the man.	 	I saw the man who loves you.
 	 	You are a darling. I said that.	 	I said that you are a darling.
To support the idea scholars generally point to the fact that across IE languages relative and interrogative pronouns are often etymologically related, as well as deictic pronouns and subordinating conjunctions.

Recent research (see the discussion in Clackson 2007, which we follow here) suggests that this idea needs revision. There are two principal reasons:

the development of a subordinating marker need not parallel the development of the structure;
we do not find examples among modern languages of the development from paratactic to hypotactic structure.
In the midst of the controversy lie the pronouns *yo- and *kʷo-/kʷi-, which provide two possible reconstructions for the relative pronoun, assuming that this particular type of subordination did in fact exist in the PIE period. In particular, we find relative pronouns derived from *yo- in Greek, Indo-Iranian, Slavic and Celtic; while we find *kʷo-/kʷi- in this role in Anatolian, Latin and Tocharian. Without further information, we have little on which to decide whether both should be reconstructed as relative pronouns in PIE, or whether one should be reconstructed as the relative, while the other would be an innovation.

As it turns out, recent work on types of relative clauses provides a possible path to resolution. We may isolate two different types of relative clause, exhibited by the following English statements:

Restrictive	 	The dog (which) I bit growled.
Non-Restrictive	 	The dog, which I later bit, growled.
The restrictive or defining relative clause serves to delimit its antecedent, providing information necessary for the proper identification of its referent. The non-restrictive, or descriptive or appositional, relative clause, by contrast, adds only non-essential information.

If we now consider Hittite, Vedic Sanskrit, archaic Latin, and Homeric Greek with these relative clause types in mind, we find a striking pattern (Clackson 2007):

 	 	Hittite, Latin	 	Vedic, Homeric Greek
Relative pronoun	 	*kʷo-/kʷi-	 	*yo-
Most common relative clause	 	restrictive	 	non-restrictive
Most common clause order	 	relative--main	 	main--relative
Thus the syntactic evidence supports not only the possibility of subordination in PIE in the form of relative clauses, but also suggests that the reconstruction of two possible relative markers would fit nicely with two different syntactic substructures.

Wackernagel's Law
One of the earliest and most widely accepted laws to be posited for PIE is Wackernagel's Law, named after the scholar who discovered it in the early 19th century. This law asserts that enclitics, which by definition have no accent of their own, are drawn to second position in a sentence, falling behind the first accented word. The Anatolian languages in particular provide numerous examples supporting the law (Clackson 2007):

Luwian	 	zam=pa=kuwa DUMU-nin wallindu
 	 	This child they shall lift.
The particles appear in boldface, and they follow the demonstrative zam 'this'.

Recent work, however, has forced scholars to rethink some of the details of Wackernagel's Law. Issues arise when elements of the utterance are shifted to the front. This shift to the front, or left given our orthography, essentially occurs in two ways. One way linguists term fronting, or focus, which simply denotes the movement of an important element of the clause to the front to highlight it. In the resulting utterance, the fronted element remains within the clause, with all the attendant morphology. Linguists distinguish this movement from what they call left-detachment, which denotes the addition of material before, i.e. outside of, the clause. Compare the following examples in English (Clackson 2007):

 	 	Fronting	 	Left-Detachment
 	 	 	 	 
English	 	That boy I don't like.	 	As for that boy, I don't like him.
Notice how, in the example of left-detachment, the pronoun him recapitulates the noun phrase that boy, which stands outside of the clause.

Wackernagel's Law, simply interpreted, should imply that enclitics follow the fronted element in a clause, regardless of whether this is preceded by a left-detached element (which, by definition, does not form part of the clause). We do in fact find this in Hittite; unfortunately this does not always work, for example, in Greek: enclitics may follow the left-detached element in Greek, preceding the fronted element. As Hale has shown (see the discussion in Clackson 2007), Vedic further complicates the issue, allowing enclitics in both positions:

Vedic	 	utá vā yó no marcáyād ánāgasaḥ
 	 	Or also who would do harm to innocent us...
Here utá 'also' is left-detached, while yó 'who' is fronted. Hale categorizes enclitics into two groups: those with scope over the whole sentence and connectives follow what he calls the TOPIC (i.e. left-detached) element, while enclitic pronouns follow the fronted element. But unfortunately the data fails to be as clear-cut as one would hope:

Vedic	 	sám āmaṃśa sumatíbʰiḥ kó asya
 	 	Who has attained his good-will?
Here the enclitic pronoun asya 'his, of him' follows the fronted element, the interrogative pronoun kó 'who'. But if kó is fronted, then what stands before it must be left-detached, and hence must fall outside the clause. However in the above case the clause requires the left-detached element to complete the clause. Thus recent developments have led to a reanalysis of even the firmest of IE syntactic laws.

Phrasal Reconstruction and PIE Poetics
Let us finally return to the question of just what it means to reconstruct, say, basic word order for PIE. In our initial examples illustrating the verb-final word order we assume for PIE, we noted that the exemplars exhibited parallel structure, but not necessarily parallel semantic elements. Watkins (1976) in a celebrated article pointed the way to a more specific form of syntactic reconstruction, which we outline very briefly here. As point of departure he takes the Old Irish relative forms of the finite verb, special forms that derive from a combination of the PIE verb with the relative marker *yo-: e.g. 3 pl. rel. gontae 'they-who-kill/whom-they-kill' < PIE *gʷenonti + yo-. He focuses on a specific proverb from Old Irish:

 	 	Old Irish	 	 
Proverb	 	gonas	 	.géntar
 	 	he-who-kills	 	he-will-be-killed
The focus on proverbs serves two primary purposes: they preserve archaic syntax, and they preserve ancient thematic content. Focusing for a moment on the content, we see gonas as reflecting a possible PIE

 	 	PIE	 	 
 	 	*gʷʰenti	 	*yo-
 	 	kills	 	Rel.
Leaving that aside for the moment, let us turn to a Greek proverb in the Iliad:

18.309	 	ksunòs	 	Enuálios,	 	kaí te	 	ktanéonta	 	katékta
 	 	alike to all (is)	 	the War God,	 	and	 	him-who-would-kill	 	he kills
Here ktanéonta is a future participle in the accusative, katékta the finite verb form. The future participle lends the connotation of intension or desire, hence the translation 'would kill'. We now note that Greek largely replaces the PIE root *gʷʰen- with the synonymous kten-. Given these two points, and recognizing that participles are formally equivalent to relative clauses, we may see the Greek phrase ktanéonta katékta as the thematic and structural equivalent of an original PIE phrase

 	 	PIE	 	 	 	 
 	 	*(gʷʰi)gʷʰṇ-H₁se-ti	 	*yom	 	*gʷʰenti
 	 	would-kill	 	whom	 	he-kills
In the above the first verb form shows the optional reduplication and the suffix *-H₁se- of the PIE desiderative formation. If we finally take the same phrase, but make the construction passive, we find

 	 	PIE	 	 	 	 
 	 	*gʷʰenti	 	*yo(s)	 	*(gʷʰi)gʷʰṇ-H₁se-to(r)
 	 	kills	 	he-who	 	would-be-killed
This recapitulates exactly not only the morphology but also syntactic structure of the original Old Irish proverb gonas .géntar. That is, we have managed to recover an actual, specific phrase present in PIE itself!

Summary
The study of Indo-European diachronic syntax still provides some of the most promising avenues of study of the parent language and culture. Several methods may be brought to bear, and each has something to offer. If we imagine ourselves in the position of a student of some foreign language, such as German, we might wonder how to say 'Someone does something to someone else' in general; statements about typology attempt to reach answers, saying e.g. that the 'does something' part generally comes second. We might also wonder how to say 'It's always toughest at the beginning'; reconstruction of PIE poetics aims towards such answers, saying e.g. that that idea is expressed as Aller Anfang ist schwer. We do a disservice to the discipline it we force one particular method to answer questions of both types; certainly we would not want a description of how to form 'Someone does something to someone' to come in the form: 'If the verb is haben, we say...; if the verb is loben, we say...', etc. Nor would we expect proverbs to employ the same syntactic structures used in the most common discourse, since they by their nature preserve ideas and phrases that are in some sense timeless and immune to change. The study of PIE syntax can only benefit from the skilled application of both methods under appropriate circumstances.

21 Historical Phonology: Resonants & Laryngeals
The reader may derive some sense of relief from the fact that we have finally arrived at the last major installment of historical phonology: the resonants and laryngeals. They allow a more streamlined presentation than that given for the vowels and the consonants, if only because they are fewer in number.

21.1 Resonants
21.1.1 Medial Resonants

Resonants between consonants change in Tocharian to their consonantal equivalent, preceded by the reduced vowel *ä:

 	 	PIE *CṚC > PToch *CäRC.
Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*CṚC	 	*CäRC	 	 	 	*bʰṛǵʰ-	 	*pärk-	 	A pärk-	 	Hitt. park-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'rise'	 	 	 	B pärk-	 	Skt. bṛhant-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*wḷkʷo-	 	*wälkʷæ-	 	A	 	Skt. vṛka-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'wolf'	 	 	 	B walkwe	 	Goth. wulfs
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*mṇ-sḱe / o-	 	*mänsk-	 	A mäsk-	 	Lat. maneō
 	 	 	 	 	 	'remain'	 	 	 	B mäsk-	 	Gk. ménō
In the last example, PIE *mṇ-sḱe / o- > AB mäsk-, the consonantal *n is lost regularly before *s.

21.1.2 Final Resonants

With resonants in final position we find the same process as in medial position as described above, except when the resonant is PIE *n. That is, resonants in final position become their consonantal equivalent, preceded by *ä, and thereby remain in final position; *n in final position, however, generally falls away together with the preceding *ä:

PIE *CṚ# > PToch *CäR#, but
PIE *Cṇ# > PToch *Cä(n)# > PToch *C#.
Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*CṚ#	 	*CäR#	 	 	 	*uH₁-ṛ	 	*wä(H)är	 	A wär	 	Skt. vāri-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'water'	 	> *wäär	 	B war	 	ON vari
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Cṇ#	 	*Ø#	 	 	 	*stH₂-mṇ	 	*stāmä(n)	 	A stām	 	Gk. stēmōn
 	 	 	 	 	 	'(something) standing'	 	 	 	B stām	 	Lat. stāmen
21.1.3 Initial Resonants

Initial resonants likewise convert into their consonantal twins. But unlike the situation for medial and final resonants, the accompanying vowel is PToch *æ rather than *ä:

 	 	PIE *#ṚC > PToch *æRC.
This holds for all resonants. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*#ṚC	 	*æRC	 	 	 	*ṇ-ǵneH₃-tiH₂	 	*æn-knā-tsā	 	A āknāts	 	Lat. ignōtus
 	 	 	 	 	 	'unknowing'	 	> *ān-knā-tsā	 	B aknā́tsa	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*H₁ṛgʷ-ont-	 	*ærkænt-	 	A arkant	 	Skt. rájas
 	 	 	 	 	 	'dark'	 	 	 	B erkent	 	 
In the first example we witness a change *æ > *ā in Proto-Tocharian due to assimilation to the following *ā.

21.2 Laryngeals
We have seen already that laryngeals have a dramatic effect on neighboring vowels. In particular, we will not repeat here the development of laryngeals in the positions *VH; the treatment can be found under the appropriate long vowel. Here we treat another laryngeals in a different context, specifically when they carry syllabic content (akin to a resonant). We also discuss the development of laryngeals when neighboring a resonant and when they form a boundary between vowels.

21.2.1 Medial Laryngeals

Laryngeals between consonants yield Proto-Tocharian *ā, and therefore fall together with original PIE short-*a in Proto-Tocharian:

 	 	PIE *CḤC > PToch *CāC.
Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*CḤC	 	*CāC	 	 	 	*pH₂tḗr	 	*pācær	 	A pācar	 	Skt. pitár-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'father'	 	 	 	B pācer	 	Gk. patēr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*(s)tH₂-k-	 	*tāk-	 	A tāk-	 	Hitt. tak-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'stand'	 	 	 	B tāk-	 	Gk. héstēka
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*pH₂-sḱe/o-	 	*pāsk-	 	A	 	Hitt. pahs-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'protect'	 	 	 	B pāsk-	 	Skt. pā-
21.2.2 Final Laryngeals

When in final position, as when between consonants, a laryngeal yields PToch *ā:

 	 	PIE *CH# > PToch *Cā#
This factors particularly strongly in the reflex of the neuter plural ending for the nominative and oblique.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*CH#	 	*Cā#	 	 	 	*méms-H₂	 	*més-H₂	 	A	 	Skt. māṃsá-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'meat'	 	> *m'äsā	 	B mīsa	 	Got. mimz
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*H₂óst-H₂	 	*æstā	 	A	 	Lat. oss
 	 	 	 	 	 	'bone'	 	> *āstā	 	B āsta	 	Gk. ospʰús
The last example above shows the development of B āsta, plural of the noun B āy 'bone'. We see the action of umlaut in Proto-Tocharian reflected in the change *æstā > *āstā.

21.2.3 Laryngeals with Resonants

Occasionally a laryngeal follows a resonant between consonants. In such positions, the laryngeal is lost without a trace in Proto-Tocharian:

 	 	PIE *CṚHC > PToch *CäRC.
The resonant undergoes its normal evolution. When the laryngeal stands in initial position before a resonant, however, it might be that the treatment differs depending on whether the resonant is PIE *ṇ or not:

PIE *#HṚC > PToch *#ænC, but
PIE *#HṇC > PToch *#ānC.
The evidence unfortunately is scant, and scholarly opinion has not yet reached a consensus. Consider the following example.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*CṚHC	 	*CäRC	 	 	 	*pṛH₂-wo-	 	*pärwæ	 	A pärwat	 	Skt. pū́rva-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'anterior'	 	 	 	B parwe	 	 
21.2.4 Laryngeals between Vowels

Generally speaking a laryngeal between vowels falls away with subsequent coalescence of the preceding and following vowels:

 	 	PIE *VHV > *VV > *V̄.
Such a development gives little cause for surprise, considering the preceding discussion of laryngeals. What is rather remarkable, however, is that some evidence suggests that such laryngeal loss may have occurred close enough to the Proto-Tocharian period for the hiatus between the two vowels to remain and allow further changes. Consider the following example:

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*VHV	 	*VV > *V̄	 	 	 	*kléu-mo-H₃ō(n)	 	*klyäumæ(H)u	 	A klyom	 	Skt. śrutá-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'to be heard'	 	> *klyäumo-u > *klyumõ	 	B klyomo	 	Gk. klutós
The major point at issue here is that final PIE *-ō generally produces *-u in Tocharian. We do not however find this reflex in the above example. Rather it seems that the former presence of a laryngeal may produce a hiatus that remains long enough for the following vowel, *-u, to influence the preceding vowel, *æ-, according to Tocharian umlaut. Thus *æ > *o, which subsequently coalesces with the following -u to produce a new Tocharian *õ.

22 Primary Case Endings: Dual
In Tocharian previous scholarship typically makes a distinction between the paral and the dual. The paral forms mark pairs of quantities that are in some sense `natural,' that is, of things which naturally come in twos: eyes, ears, hands, etc. The dual forms by contrast mark 'occasional' pairs, things which just happen to be paired at the moment: two boys, two trees, etc. Just what exactly constitutes a 'natural' versus an 'occasional' pair in Tocharian leaves quite a bit of room for debate, however: certainly the paral A aśäṃ B eś(a)ne '(pair of) eyes' is to be expected, but the paral B ñaktene '(a naturally occurring pair of) gods', translated as 'the god and his wife,' might come as a surprise.

The historical perspective further weakens the distinction, since the paral forms generally derive from original PIE duals when such an antecedent can be reconstructed. That is, if we compare the singular and dual for *H₃ekʷ- 'eye', we find the following evolution:

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	*H₃ékʷ-s	 	*æk	 	A ak
 	 	'eye'	 	 	 	B ek
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Dual	 	*H₃ekʷ-iH₁	 	*æśä + næ	 	A aśäṃ
 	 	'two eyes'	 	 	 	B eśane
That is, the regular dual in PIE would give PToch *æś(ä), differing from the singular *æk only in the palatalization of the final consonant. This seems to have led to a recharacterization by means of a suffix *+næ (Pinault 2008). Moreover we in fact find the expected dual form B eś in the compound B eś-lmau 'the eyes set,' i.e. 'blinded.'

Because of this somewhat tenuous distinction between the paral and dual, we employ the term dual in these lessons to encompass both formations, unless stated otherwise.

22.1 Dual Suffix
As mentioned above, Tocharian often employs a nasal suffix A -(ä)ṃ B -(a)ne to characterize dual forms. Scholarly opinion is divided as to the origin of this suffix. It may perhaps reflect the PIE *n-stem formation so widespread in Tocharian (Adams 1988). On the other hand, it may reflect a demonstrative adjective in apposition to the substantive and reinterpreted as a suffix (Pinault 2008). Consider the following:

Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*n-Stem	 	*ṇkw-o-no-H₁	 	*ænkwænæ	 	B eṅkwene
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*no- Demonstrative	 	*ṇkw-o-H₁e + no-H₁e	 	*ænkwæyä-næyä	 	B eṅkwene
The first example shows the development from a dual ending applied to an *n-stem, while the second shows the development from a dual form built to the normal thematic stem, followed by another demonstrative in the dual. Note that the former argument supposes a change *-ō# > *æ in Proto-Tocharian.

Whatever the origin, the suffix *-næ evidently provides a productive means of deriving a dual form in Tocharian, and it is applied to PToch dual forms which themselves derive from PIE duals. Thus, even if not in origin a deictic adjective, PToch *-næ comes to function in PToch in much the way illustrated in the second example above. Thus we may analyze, for example, B ñaktene '(pair of) gods' as a dual ñakte inherited from PIE, followed by the PToch dual suffix *-næ.

22.2 Nominative and Oblique
The nominative and oblique dual endings generally follow from their PIE counterparts. The following chart summarizes the developments.

Dual	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Thematic	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. anim.	 	*-o-H₁ > *-ō	 	*-u > *-ä	 	 
Voc.	 	*-o-H₁ > *-ō	 	*-u > *-ä	 	 
Acc. anim.	 	*-o-H₁ > *-ō	 	*-u > *-ä	 	 
Nom./Acc. neut.	 	*-o-iH₁	 	*-oy > *-äy	 	A -i B -i
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Athematic	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. anim.	 	*-H₁(e)	 	*-yä	 	 
Voc.	 	*-H₁(e)	 	*-yä	 	 
Acc. anim.	 	*-H₁(e)	 	*-yä	 	 
Nom./Acc. neut.	 	*-iH₁	 	*-(i)yä	 	AB -yi
The presence or absence of the thematic vowel will therefore influence the Proto-Tocharian reflex, in addition of course to the division between neuter and non-neuter substantives.

22.2.1 Thematic Nouns

With non-neuter thematic nouns, we generally find the development PIE *-o-H₁ > *-u > *ä according to normal Tocharian phonetic changes. At the same time, however, in the Proto-Tocharian period speakers tended to reform the dual with the suffix *-næ, and so the preceding *ä is either lost or retained depending on accentual patterns:

Dual	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom./Acc.	 	*ōmso-H₁	 	*ānsä + næ	 	A *āysän > esäṃ	 	Lat. umerus
 	 	'two shoulders'	 	 	 	B antsane, āntsne	 	Got. ams
In some instances however we find a different outcome, perhaps derived from the PIE vocative and the action of Kuiper's law, whereby a final laryngeal is generally dropped. Consider the following (cf. Pinault 2008):

Dual	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom./Acc.	 	*-o-(H₁)	 	*ñäktæ + næ	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	'two gods'	 	B ñakte-ne	 	 
We find a similar formation for neuter thematic nouns:

Dual	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom./Acc.	 	*H₂(e)nt-bʰo-iH₁	 	*āntäpäy	 	A āmpi	 	Gk. ámpʰō
 	 	'both'	 	 	 	B antapi, āntpi	 	Lat. ambō
22.2.2 Athematic Nouns

The nominative and accusative forms of athematic nouns follow the same basic pattern. The major difference is that the absence of the thematic vowel means that the front vocalism of the vowel in the ending generally leads to palatalization of the preceding consonant. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Example	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-H₁(e)	 	*-yä	 	 	 	*pod-H₁e	 	*pæyä + næ	 	A pe-ṃ	 	Hitt. pad-
 	 	 	 	 	 	'two feet'	 	 	 	B pai-ne	 	Got. fōtus
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*-nt-H₁e	 	*(räso)-ñcä	 	A	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	B (raso)ñc	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-iH₁	 	*-(i)yä	 	 	 	*H₃ekʷ-iH₁	 	*æśä + næ	 	A aśäṃ	 	Gk. ósse
 	 	 	 	 	 	'two eyes'	 	 	 	B eśane	 	OCS oči
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*bʰrātr-iH₁	 	*prātriyä	 	A pratri	 	Eng. brother
 	 	 	 	 	 	'brother'	 	 	 	B	 	Lat. frater
Note the effect of palatalization on the *nt-stem. This yields a productive dual suffix in Tocharian B, here illustrated with raso 'span'. In the final example, note that A pratri does not in fact show the expected palatalization.

22.3 Genitive
In the genitive dual we find the endings A -nis B -naisäñ, with palatalization of the preceding consonant: A aśnis B eśnaisäñ 'of two eyes'. The analysis likely follows that given above for the nominative and accusative: the palatalization derives from the original PIE dual ending, and to this we find addition of a demonstrative adjective *no-. The latter shows a form also encountered in the pronouns, perhaps deriving from *-no-i-H₁u-s > *-næyäs > *-nais-.

23 Adjective Class III: Athematic *nt-Stems
Adjectives with stems in *nt- form a major category in the Proto-Indo-European inventory. Several of the most common adjectives in Tocharian trace their origins back to such PIE forms. We take as exemplar the adjective A kāsu B kartse 'good'. Below we list the paradigm.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	kāsu	 	*krä(ṃ)ts	 	 	 	 	 	kartse	 	kartsa
G	 	krantāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	kreñcepi	 	 
Obl.	 	krant, krañcäṃ	 	kräntsāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	krent	 	kartsai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Du.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	kartsi	 	 
Obl.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	kreñc	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	kraṃś	 	krant	 	 	 	 	 	kreñc	 	krenta
G	 	krañcäśśi	 	*krantāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	krentaṃts	 	krentaṃts
Obl.	 	krañcäs	 	krant	 	 	 	 	 	krentäṃ	 	krenta
The exact PIE root from which this adjective derives remains unclear. In forms other than the masculine nominative singular, we see that the root likely has the basic shape *KṛH-, to which was suffixed *-ont-. Here *K denotes any velar consonant and *H any laryngeal (thereby giving the root a *CVC shape expected in PIE). The Tocharian A masculine nominative singular points to a different root shape, perhaps *ḱHs-, while the equivalent form in Tocharian B actually points to the feminine nominative singular. Below we list some of the forms for which derivations are reasonably clear, given these root shapes. This illustrates the general features of the development of *nt-stem adjectives from Proto-Indo-European into Tocharian.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	*ḱHswo-ō(n)	 	*kaswo-	 	kāsu	 	 
G	 	*KṛH-ont-	 	*kärænt-	 	krantāp	 	krencepi
Obl.	 	*KṛH-ont-ṃ	 	*käræntä(n)	 	krant	 	krent

Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	*KṛH-ṇt-iH₂	 	*käräntsā	 	*kräṃts	 	kartsa

G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	*KṛH-ont-H₂	 	*käræntā	 	krant	 	krenta
Note in the masculine genitive singular form B krencepi we have palatalized -nc- following the pattern given by orotstse, G Sg. oroccepi. In general the genitive forms show the inherited base followed by the reformed Tocharian endings. We find the extension of palatalization to the accusative also in the masculine plural form A krañcäs. The feminine singular oblique form in Tocharian A shows the addition of the typical oblique ending A -ṃ to the form of the nominative singular. The nominative singular forms themselves hold special interest. In Tocharian A, the masculine form evidently derives from a different root, while the feminine form is lacking. In Tocharian B, the feminine nominative singular follows regularly, and it appears that this in fact provides the base for a reformed masculine form.

The adjective A puk B po 'each, all, whole' forms another prevalent member of this adjective class. The paradigm follows.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	puk	 	puk	 	 	 	 	 	po	 	po
G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	poñcäṃ	 	pontsāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	po	 	po
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	poñś	 	pont	 	 	 	 	 	poñc	 	ponta
G	 	poñcäśśi	 	pontāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	pontaṃts	 	pontaṃts
Obl.	 	poñcäs	 	pont	 	 	 	 	 	pontäṃ	 	ponta
Though the above paradigm lists a variety of forms for different cases, numbers, and genders, the Tocharian languages in fact often employ A puk B po as an indeclinable adjective. That is, the forms A puk and B po may modify substantives of any gender, number, or case. In Tocharian B texts alternately employ the declined forms listed in the paradigm above in the plural for both genders; in Tocharian A they alternately employ declined forms in both singular and plural.

When modifying a substantive in the singular, A puk B po can have the sense of 'each, every', as in A puk praṣtaṃ 'every time', or the sense 'all the, the whole', as in A puk kapśañi B po kektseñe 'the whole body'. In the plural the sense is generally 'all (the)': A puk wrasañ B po onolmi 'all (the) living beings'. In prose, this adjective always precedes the substantive which it modifies.

The historical evolution parallels that described for A kāsu B kartse. Take the following for example.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch	 	Comparanda
Masculine

N/Obl. Pl.	 	*péH₂-nt-H₂	 	*pontā	 	A pont	 	Gk. pánta
 	 	(neuter pl.)	 	 	 	B ponta	 	 
In the Proto-Tocharian period, Tocharian speakers borrowed a word *pærnæ from Middle Iranian. The resultant words A paräṃ B perne mean 'glory' in the documented Tocharian languages. At the same time, an adjectival formation arises in Proto-Tocharian, *pærnæ-wænt-, which employs the PIE suffix *-wont- carrying the connotation 'possessing'. The result is the adjective A parno B perneu 'glorious, possessing glory' whose forms are listed below.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	parno	 	parnoṃts	 	 	 	 	 	perneu	 	pernauntsa
G	 	parnontāp	 	*parnontse	 	 	 	 	 	*pernente	 	 
Obl.	 	parnont	 	parnontsāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	pernent	 	pernauntsai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Du.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	perneñc	 	 
Obl.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	perneñc	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	parnoṣ	 	parnont	 	 	 	 	 	perneñc	 	pernenta
G	 	parnoñcäśśi	 	*parnontāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	pernentäṃts	 	pernentaṃts
Obl.	 	parnoñcäs	 	parnont	 	 	 	 	 	pernentäṃ	 	pernenta
In Proto-Tocharian contraction evidently gives *pærnæ-wænt- > *pærnænt-, yielding the base for the masculine forms; the feminine forms apparently derive from *pærnæ-wäntsā-, which harkens back to the PIE zero-grade *-wṇt-iH₂. The origin of the masculine nominative singular forms still enjoys some scholarly debate.

We also find a related adjectival formation typified by the declension of A tālo B tallāu 'miserable'. We list the forms below.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	tālo	 	tāloṃts	 	 	 	 	 	tallāu	 	tallauntsa
G	 	tālontāp	 	*tālontse	 	 	 	 	 	tallānte	 	 
Obl.	 	tālont	 	tālontsāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	tallānt	 	tallauntsai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	tāloṣ	 	tālont	 	 	 	 	 	tallāñc	 	tallānta
G	 	tāloñcäśśi	 	*tālontāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	tallāntäṃts	 	tallāntaṃts
Obl.	 	tāloñcäs	 	tālont	 	 	 	 	 	tallāntäṃ	 	tallānta
This formation ultimately derives from adjectives built on roots ending in PToch *ā; in the above instance this derives from original PIE *H: *tḷ-n-H₂- from the root *telH₂-, giving PToch *tälnā- > *tällā-. To this Tocharian adds the same *-wont- suffix, but the root-final *-ā- produces a different vocalism in the resulting forms. Tocharian A further innovates by employing the -o- of the masculine nominative singular throughout the remaining paradigm, thereby removing the distinction between this paradigm and that exhibited by A parno. Tocharian B, however, preserves the original distinction.

Finally we should mention in this context the paradigm typified by AB ymassu 'conscious', evidently an adjective built upon the noun B ime 'conscience' by means of the suffix *-(w)ont-. The following table lists the forms.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ymassu	 	ymassuṃts	 	 	 	 	 	ymassu	 	ymassuntsa
G	 	ymassuntāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ymassonte	 	 
Obl.	 	ymassunt	 	ymassuntsāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	ymassont	 	ymassuntsai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	ymassuṣ	 	ymassunt	 	 	 	 	 	ymassoñc	 	ymassonta
G	 	ymassuñcäśśi	 	*ymassuntāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	ymassontäṃts	 	ymassontaṃts
Obl.	 	ymassuñcäs	 	ymassunt	 	 	 	 	 	ymassontäṃ	 	ymassonta
The forms clearly resemble those of the preceding paradigms, with the notable exception of the masculine nominative singular. Suffice it to say that scholars have yet to come to a consensus on the origins of this form. Whatever its origin, Tocharian A has extended the u-vocalism throughout the remainder of the paradigm.

24 Present Athematic Classes: I, V, VI, VII
The lack of a thematic vowel intervening between the root (possibly extended by a suffix) and the personal endings characterizes the athematic presents. Recall that the thematic vowel *-e- develops into PToch *-(y)ä-, causing palatalization of the preceding consonant. Given that the thematic vowel is absent, athematic conjugations demonstrate a lack of palatalization of the stem-final consonant. This provides the single most distinctive feature between the thematic and athematic conjugations.

Tocharian B did not remain content with solely athematic forms, and therefore imported some forms from the thematic conjugation. These forms only concern those with original thematic *-o-, specifically the active first and third person plural. Tocharian B also occasionally shows active first person singular ending -au imported from the thematic conjugation.

In both languages anaptyxis often inserts the reduced vowel *-ä- where the consonant of the ending comes into contact with the stem-final consonant. Tocharian B regularly promotes this vowel to -a- when the accent falls on this syllable. Note also in Tocharian A that the reduced vowel in the active third person plural ending is promoted to -i- in the palatal context: *-äñc > -iñc. One should not confuse this *-ä- resulting from anaptyxis with the *-ä- decended from the theme vowel *-e- in the thematic conjugations; where such ambiguity arises, the palatalization or lack thereof of the stem-final consonant should serve to distinguish whether the conjugation is thematic or athematic.

24.1 Present Class I
CLASS I comprises root athemtic verbs. The formation parallels CLASS II, which contains root thematic verbs, but omits the thematic vowel. In a sense, the root athematic verbs are the most basic PIE verbal formation. The discussion of the CLASS II presents shows that PIE thematic *-e- leads to palatalization of the root-final consonant. Given the absence of the theme vowel in CLASS I, the root-final consonant suffers no palatalization. Compare the following forms of the CLASS I verb pälk- 'shine' and the CLASS II verb āk- 'lead'.

CLASS	 	Root	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	pälk-	 	*bʰḷg-Ø+se	 	*pälk-äs 'ä	 	pälkäṣ	 	 
 	 	 	 	*bʰḷg-Ø+nu	 	*pälk-än	 	 	 	palkäṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
II	 	āk-	 	*H₂eǵ-e+se	 	*āk-'ä-s 'ä	 	āśäṣ	 	 
 	 	 	 	*H₂eǵ-e+nu	 	*āk-'ä-n	 	 	 	āśäṃ
We do find, however, the insertion of *-ä- to break up consonant clusters. This *-ä- results in B -a- when stressed.

In this root class, one expects to find alternation between full and zero grade of the root vowel. In fact one generally finds zero grade throughout the paradigm, as in PIE *bʰḷg- > *pälk- above (cf. Lat. fulgō < *bʰḷg-, but Gk. pʰlégō < *bʰleg-). Some CLASS I verbs nevertheless show a lengthened *ē-grade: B plyewäṃ < *pl'æw-n < PIE *plēw-Ø+nu (cf. Gk. pléō, Ved. plávate, both from full grade of the root).

The following table depicts the present CLASS I paradigm. The verb AB pälk- 'shine' illustrates the active forms, while A träṅk- 'say' and B kalāk- 'follow' (cf. A kälk-, which forms the non-present tenses of A i- 'go') illustrate the mediopassive forms.

Note in particular the interplay of the reduced vowel ä and the accent and/or syllable structure in the above paradigm. In particular, we find A *pälkäṣ-aṃ > pälkṣ-aṃ by regular deletion of ä in an open syllable in Tocharian A. In B palkeṃ we see stress on the initial syllable changing ä to a; however this stress shifts to the second syllable in pälken-ne, and so the vowel ä remains unchanged in this form. Second-syllable stress causes a similar change in the mediopassive participle: PToch *pälk-mānæ > *pälkämānæ > B pälkamane, where stress changes *ä to a, but lack thereof changes *ā to a; by contrast second-syllable stress, or the position in an open syllable, causes deletion of *ä altogether in *kolok(ä)māne > B kolokmane.

For convenience we list here the paradigm of i- 'go', which belongs to CLASS I. Rather than the full grade of the root, e.g. *H₁ei-mi 'I go', as commonly found elsewhere in Indo-European, Tocharian here too employs the zero grade: PIE *H₁i-mi > PToch *yä-m > A yäm B yam.

Note that the Tocharian A forms follow regularly according to CLASS I; the Tocharian B paradigm however shows influence from the nasal presents (cf. Old Latin prod-īnunt, Hitt. i-ya-an-na-i). The Tocharian B paradigm nevertheless retains the remnants of the PIE athematic first person singular ending *-mi.

24.2 Present Class V
CLASS V comprises those verbs with present suffix -ā-. The origin of this suffix remains uncertain. One likely source of the suffix derives from verbs with root-final laryngeal: PToch *-ā- < PIE *-H-. However few CLASS V verbs of certain etymology exhibit this root structure. Another likely source derives from the suffix PIE *-eH₂-, as found in the Latin first conjugation: cub-ā-re, dom-ā-re, sec-ā-re; or perhaps *-eH₂-ye / o-, with contraction across the *-y-. Verbs with this suffix in PIE generally fall into one of two types: (1) denominative, or factitive; (2) deverbative. Remnants of both types remain in Tocharian.

Denominative verbs may derive from either nouns or adjectives. Several Indo-European languages preserve such constructions, e.g. Lat. novāre 'make new' (cf. Lat. novus 'new') and Gk. neãn 'to replow' (cf. Gk. néos 'new'). The Tocharian texts preserve examples of deverbatives from both nouns and adjectives: B kleṅke 'vehicle' > B klāṅkā- 'to ride, travel'; B swāre 'sweet' > B swārā-. The formation klāṅkā- however provides the preterite (Class I), not the present, stem of the verb klānk-; swārā- nevertheless provides the subjunctive (CLASS vi) stem of swār-, which as we will see is generally formally identical to present stem formation in Tocharian. In fact, given this formal identity between present and subjunctive, when an *ā-stem thus formed was coopted as a subjunctive, the present was often reformed according to CLASS IV or CLASS VI: B klautke 'manner, way' > klāutkā- (subjunctive) 'turn, become', and hence klautko- (present CLASS IV); B skeye 'effort' > skāyā- (subjunctive) 'strive', and hence B skāinā- (present CLASS VI).

Deverbative verbs of course are further extensions of roots which are originally verbal themselves. For example, B kwa- 'to call' < PIE *ǵʰu(H)-eH₂-, cf. OCS hŭvati 'to call'.

As the last examples illustrates, Tocharian commonly added the *-ā- suffix to roots with zero grade. Consider also B pälwā- 'bemoan' < PIE *bʰḷw-eH₂-. However Tocharian frequently builds verbs of this class with roots in full grade: B ānā-sk- 'inhale, breathe' < PIE *H₂enH₁-eH₂-(sḱe / o)-

The following table depicts the present CLASS V paradigm. The prime example of CLASS V formation is the verb AB läk- 'see'. In Tocharian A, läk- forms a CLASS V present; in Tocharian B läk- forms a CLASS v subjunctive. The CLASS v subjunctive of B läk- nevertheless follows the same morphological paradigm as any other CLASS V present in Tocharian B; läk- therefore provides an excellent point of formal comparison between the two languages. The following chart also provides the actual Tocharian B present of läk-, which happens to be of CLASS IX.

Pres. Ppl.	 	lkāmāṃ	 	lkāmane	 	lkāskemane
Note the shift of accent and concomitant shift in vowel quality in the Tocharian B forms with the addition of the pronominal suffix. The verb B śu- 'eat' provides an example of the Tocharian B present participle for CLASS V, since this form does not appear for B läk- in extant Tocharian texts (naturally so, since B läk- only forms a CLASS V subjunctive, not present).

24.3 Present Class VI
CLASS VI comprises a number of the so-called nasal presents, a class of fundamental importance in both Indo-European generally and Tocharian specifically. This class, in Indo-European terms, is an infixing class; that is, rather than add a suffix to the end of the root, this class adds an infix within the root itself (i.e. somewhere after the initial consonant, and before the final consonant of the root). The infix in this instance is PIE *-ne-, which as an infix characterizes durative action in PIE; hence its association with the present tense in the daughter languages, and its absence in the past tenses. This still survives in English stand (present, with infix) vs. stood (past, no infix). The PIE nasal infix is subject to vowel gradation, yielding an alternation between full- and zero-grade forms: *-ne- vs. *-n-.

The Tocharian CLASS VI ultimately has its origin in the nasal infixation of PIE roots with final laryngeal, a class found among the seṭ roots of Sanskrit, e.g. pṛṇā́ti vs. pṛṇītá; and elsewhere as in Greek dámnāmi, dámnāto. The Tocharian forms show only the zero grade of the infix, which combined with the root-final laryngeal yields PIE *-n-H- > PToch *-nā- > AB -nā-. Consider the following examples.

PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*tḷ-n-H₂-	 	*tälnā-	 	 	 	tallaṃ	 	Gk. tela-, talássai, étlā (dor.)
 	 	 	 	 	 	tlanatär	 	Lat. tollō < PIE *tḷ-n-H₂-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	OIr. tlenaid
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*(s)kd-n-H₂-	 	*kätnā-	 	knāṣ	 	katnaṃ	 	Gk. skídnēmi < PIE *skd-ne-H₂-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*mus-n-H-	 	*musnā-	 	musnātär	 	musnātar	 	Skt. muṣṇā́ti < PIE *mus-ne-H-
In the form A knāṣ we notice simplification of the cluster -tn-: A knā- < *känā- < PToch *kätnā-. Such simplification in common in Tocharian, e.g. *karp-nā- > A kārnaṣ, as is assimilation: *tälnā- > *tällā- > B talla-.

The above Tocharian B form tlanatär also shows another general feature: when PToch inserts -ä- to break up consonant clusters resulting from the nasal, the Tocharian B accent changes this to -a- when it falls on this syllable, and the -ā- following the nasal is reduced to -a-. Hence, Tocharian B shows alternation between -nā- and -ana-.

Perhaps even more interestingly, Tocharian A (only) shows a tendency to truly infix, synchronically, the -n- in roots ending in -tk- and -sk-. This infix always directly precedes the -k-. The -nā- syllable is thus broken up, the -n- preceding the -k of the root, and the -ā- following the -k: A kātk- 'rise' > kāt-än-k-ā-ṣ; A wāsk- 'move' > wās-än-k-ā-tär. We see in these examples that Tocharian A also shows the insertion of -ä- to break up the resulting consonant clusters. And as if this were not interesting enough, the verb AB kätk- 'cross', which obeys this rule in Tocharian A (*kät-än-k-ā- > A ktäṇkāṣ, ktäṇkeñc), shows both possibilities in Tocharian B: the verb forms a regular CLASS VI present with a -nā- suffix, B kätkanaṃ < *kätk-änā-, and a CLASS VII present, B kättaṇkäṃ, which derives from a true nasal infix in the final cluster -tk-.

As mentioned above, the original roots of this class contained a root-final laryngeal. Given that the nasal infix is a PIE durative marker, these roots tended to be originally aoristic or perfective. Hence they tended to form root aorists. In this sense, it comes as little surprise that verbs which form CLASS VI presents often form Class I (root aorists with root-final laryngeal) preterites; similarly, they tend to form CLASS v subjunctives.

Being ultimately roots with final laryngeal (though with a preceding nasal), the conjugation pattern of CLASS VI presents generally follows that of CLASS V. The verb AB kärs- 'know' serves to illustrate the paradigm.

This particular verb shows no mediopassive forms in Tocharian A, but such forms do exist in other verbs: A wenaträ < we- 'lead, spring up'. Note also the interplay between vowel quality and accent in the Tocharian B forms.

24.4 Present Class VII
CLASS VII also comprises nasal presents, but unlike CLASS VI, the verbs of this class do not go back to roots in final laryngeal. This class survives only in Tocharian B. As in CLASS VI, these verbs derive from the zero grade of the nasal infix: PIE *-n- > PT *-n-. Such verbs abound in Indo-European: for example, Lat. pingit 'paints' and Skt. piṃśáti 'carves' correspond to B piṅkäṃ 'writes', all ultimately deriving from the root PIE *peiǵ/ḱ- through nasal infixation. The appearance of -k- rather than -ś- shows that this formation is athematic in Tocharian, a somewhat problematic state of affairs, since forms such as Lat. pingit < *pi-n-g-e-ti show this formation generally follows a thematic conjugation elsewhere in Indo-European.

CLASS VII verbs in final -tk- generally show geminate -tt- accompanying infixation of the nasal. For example, kättaṅkäṃ mentioned above, from kätk- 'cross', and puttaṅkeṃ (3rd pl.), from putk- 'divide' < PIE *put-sḱe / o- (whence, perhaps, *put-eH₂- > Lat. putāre 'prune').

The verb putk- 'divide' serves to illustrate the paradigm of CLASS VII presents.

2	 	puttaṅktär
3	 	puttaṅkentär
 	 	 
Pres. Ppl.	 	puttaṅkmane
Note of course the use the thematic endings in the active 1 Sg., 1 Pl. and 3 Pl. as usually in the athematic conjugations in Tocharian B. However we also find the use of the thematic ending in the first and third person plural mediopassive, which generally does not occur in the other athematic present classes.

25 Genitive
The genitive is, most broadly, the case of relationship. Such a specification, naturally, is quite broad; it so happens however that the various uses of the genitive in Tocharian and Indo-European languages in general do span quite a broad range. In that sense, it is rather difficult to provide a detailed list of the many specific uses, nor would it necessarily be particularly fruitful in an introduction to the language. In this section we highlight some of the major uses of the genitive in Tocharian, both in terms of the overlap of usage with that of the genitive in other IE languages, as well as with a view toward idiosyncratic uses within Tocharian that may be less representative of the case's use in other branches of IE.

25.1 Basic Uses
In the majority of instances the Tocharian languages employ the genitive in functions equivalent to those encountered in other ancient Indo-European languages and their descendants. By and large these parallel the most salient uses of the preposition of in English, some of which were treated in Section 7 of Lesson 2. In particular usages such as Lincoln's assassination and Booth's assassination are classified, respectively, as objective and subjective genitives: Lincoln is the object (patient) of the action represented by the noun assassination, while Booth is the subject (agent) of the same action. Of course grammatically there is no distinction; one must distinguish the two uses based on context or prior knowledge (i.e. one must already know that Booth was the perpetrator, Lincoln the victim, in this particular assassination). Scholars classify usages such as a statue of gold as instances of the genitive of quality, where the dependent genitive of gold describes some quality (here the type of material) of the noun on which it depends. Tocharian commonly employs the genitive in these same functions.

25.2 Peculiar Uses
In some uses of the genitive the Tocharian languages either depart from or further restrict uses found in other IE languages. We discuss below some of the more important uses in this regard.

The possessive genitive denotes, straightforwardly enough, possession: A ṣtāmis pältwā B stamantse piltāsa 'the leaves of the tree'; A ptāñkte kapśañi B pudñäktentse kektseñe 'the Buddha's body'. Interestingly, however, Tocharian often opts to employ an adjective where English, say, might prefer a noun in the genitive. Consider the following examples:

A bodʰisattveṃ swāreṃ rakeyo 'through the sweet word of the Bodhisattva', but more literally 'through the sweet, Bodhisattva-related word', or even 'through the sweet, Bodhisattva-ish word'. Here bodʰisattveṃ is an adjective in the masculine singular oblique, modifying the underlying oblique in the instrumental form rakeyo (group inflection).
B poyśiññana rekauna 'the words of the all-knowing one', more strictly 'the all-knowing-one-related words'.
Similar constructions occur in other branches of Indo-European, such as Slavic, Italic and Hellenic: e.g. Homeric Odusḗion es dómon 'to the house of Odysseus'; cf. the discussion of derived adjectives in Section 13.2. Additionally, Tocharian often employs the verb 'to be' with a predicate noun in the genitive for periphrastic constructions meaning 'to have':

A tsraṣiśśi mā praski naṣ 'the energetic have no fear', literally 'fear is not of the energetic';
B prosko ket mā nesaṃ '(one) who has no fear', literally '(one) of whom there is no fear'.
Below we list other major uses of the genitive in some way peculiar to Tocharian.

Definitive Genitive: the definitive genitive restricts the scope of or further defines the noun it modifies. We predominantly find this use of the genitive in Tocharian A: A ptāñäkte ñom klyoṣluneyā 'by hearing the name (of) Buddha'; A śwātsiyis ñom was mākk ats klyoṣāmäs 'we have never heard the name (of) food'. One does find this construction in other archaic Indo-European languages, such as Old Norse. Tocharian B employs a different construction in such cases, often involving apposition: B kamartaññe ñem mā=ṣāṃ ste kākatsi 'the name dominion may not be summoned'.
Partitive Genitive: the partitive genitive denotes the whole or group of which the noun modified represents a part or individual. These frequently occur with the indeclinable adjective AB śpālmeṃ, e.g. B spālmeṃ śāmnats 'best of men' (Skt. sreṣṭʰo manuṣyāṇām). Also A ñäktaśśi pättāñkät 'the Buddhagod of the gods'. Tocharian may also employ other cases in such constructions, often contrary to what one would expect based on other IE languages: A māk śoṣi 'many (of the) people', where māk is nominative, while śoṣi is oblique; B rṣākeṃne śpālmeṃ 'foremost among the ṛṣis'.
Genitive of Agent: the genitive often denotes the agent with non-finite or periphrastic verbal constructions. For example: A śāwes käṣṣiśśi taṃne wewñu 'thus spoken by great teachers'; B rṣākeṃts lānte peṣpirttu pelaikneṣṣe cākkär 'the dharma-chakra (cycle of law, dharma) spun by the king of ṛṣis'. The construction occurs very infrequently with a finite verb form: B srukor aiśaumyepi olypo ritoytär 'sooner would death be sought by a wise man'.
25.3 The Genitive as Dative
One noteworthy function of the Tocharian genitive is its use as a dative case, denoting the indirect object. This usage likely stems from the historical evolution of pronominal case forms, where a probable source for the genitive AB -i lies with the PIE dative case itself (cf. Section 17.4.1). Tocharian generally confines this usage to verbs of giving and speaking. For example:

A ṣomāp lānt em kuprene cu 'if I give you to one king';
B brāhmaneṃts āyor aiskau-c 'I give you as a gift to the brahmans'.
In the above examples, the italicized phrases are in the genitive in Tocharian, but as the translation demonstrates, these denote the indirect object.

25.4 Genitive Absolute
Absolute constructions form an important part of the syntactic constructions in many of the ancient IE languages. The term 'absolute' derives from the notion that such constructions are divorced or removed from the grammatical structure of the remaining constituents of the sentences in which they are found. They continue even in modern English with phrases like 'that said', e.g. 'That said, let us move on to the next order of business.' In such a sentence, the phrase that said is grammatically self-contained and bears no grammatical relation to the rest of the sentence: none of the words 'let us move on to the next order of business' either depends on or modifies in any way either that or said. In this sense we say that that said is absolute.

Such constructions, as in the example of that said, generally constitute a noun or pronoun (here the pronoun that) with an accompanying participle (here the past passive participle said). In inflected languages like Tocharian, as well as Latin, Greek, and others, all substantives and adjectives must be given a case; thus a phrase like that said must occur in some case, be it nominative, accusative, etc. Typically ancient IE languages do not opt for the nominative, since this would necessarily imply a connection to the rest of the sentence; what case is chosen however varies widely across IE. Latin employs the ablative, Greek the genitive or accusative, Sanskrit the genitive or locative, Gothic the dative, and so on. Tocharian for its part employs the genitive: in an absolute construction, the substantive and attendant participle occur in the genitive to isolate themselves from the grammatical constructs of the remainder of the sentence. Of course, one has to isolate such uses from other uses of the genitive such as those described above where the dependent noun just happens to be modified by a participle.

For better or worse, the Tocharian documents illustrate very few genitive absolute constructions. Take for example B mäkte lwasāntso auṣuwaṃts ṣesa lyuketrä yṣīye 'how the night shines (when) the animals gather together', where the absolute construction appears in italics.

Buddhism: a Brief Overview
Scholars generally agree that the Buddha existed as a historical personage in India some four to five centuries before the birth of Christ. Beyond this, however, the precision with which scholars can fix details of his life varies widely. In large part this results from centuries of orally passing down his teachings and stories related to his life; unlike the Vedas, these tales did not adhere to any strict metrical form, and this allowed for greater variation in retelling. Further complicating matters is the nature of the teachings of the Buddha himself and of his disciples, which tend to de-emphasize the biographical facts of his life. The nail in the coffin, so to speak, is the development of the understanding of what the Buddha's particular nature really consists of: in later schools of Buddhist thought we find a strong emphasis upon the perpetual aspects of the Buddha-nature and an assertion that this Buddha-principle is enduring, existing before and after the 'historical Buddha'. The Buddhist literature thus began a process of enumerating other Buddhas who had preceded and followed the 'historical Buddha', and the sources consequently downplayed the importance of the chance manifestation referred to by the 'historical Buddha'. This precipitated a blurring of the distinctions between the several Buddhas and the facts peculiar to the life of the 'historical Buddha' himself.

Family History
The historical Buddha was born Siddʰārtʰa ('he whose purpose is accomplished,' i.e. 'successful') Gautama, a member of the Gotama clan. The dates of his birth range anywhere from 623 to 484 BCE, though most current scholarly works agree on dates in the range 566--486 BCE. Biographical material does agree that, regardless of the date of his birth, the Buddha lived for 80 years. He was born in Lumbini, near Kapilavastu, a city in the Śākya republic of the Kosala kingdom, located in the north of India near the Himalayas. The clan traces its origin to a ṛṣi by the name Gotama and therefore originally pertained to the brahman (priestly) caste. But at some point in its history prior to the Buddha's birth, the clan seems to have shifted to the kṣatriya (warrior) caste. The Buddha's father was Suddʰodana, king of the Śākya tribe, and his mother Māyā. Māyā died at childbirth; Suddʰodana subsequently married her sister Mahāprajāpati, who in turn raised the Buddha. We find no mention of brothers or sisters, but of numerous more distant relatives. In particular we know of two cousins, Ānanda and Devadatta. The Buddha eventually married Yaśodʰarā, who bore him a son, Rāhula. The Buddha evidently felt that such family attachment inhibited his spiritual pursuits, and at age 29 he left his family behind shortly after the birth of his son.

Early Life
Legendary accounts state that the Buddha emerged at birth from the right side of his mother, Māyā. According to one important biography composed in the second century CE, the Buddʰacarita (Acts of the Buddha) of Aśvagʰoṣa, he immediately uttered the words buddʰo 'smi "I am awakened." This highlights the fact that "Buddha" is less a name than a title, "The Awakened (One)" or "The Enlightened (One)".

The stories relate that a wandering ascetic prophesied to Suddʰodana that his son would grow to become either a great king or great religious leader. In the drive to secure an heir for his throne, Suddʰodana took every precaution to steer his son toward political greatness. In particular he gave the order that his son should not leave the palace grounds, and that the royal attendants should look after his every desire. In a reflection of the situation encountered in innumerable homes both regal and humble, this appears only to have fueled young Siddʰārtʰa's desire to see what lay beyond the palace gates. He finally prevailed upon his charioteer, who agreed to take him through the surrounding city in secret. Upon leaving the royal compound Siddʰārtʰa encountered the sights of a world very different from the sheltered one in which he had been living. The images of the poor, the sick, the dead left such a profound impact on the young prince that he resolved to leave the palace on a personal journey to seek the truth. He set out on this journey on the same night his wife Mahāprajāpati bore him a son.

Religious Development
The young Siddʰārtʰa met up with a group of five ascetics and decided to follow them in their quest for spiritual understanding. He participated in their practices of extreme physical deprivation, including fasting, designed to assist in shedding corporeal concerns. After a time Siddʰārtʰa became disillusioned with such austere practices, deeming that they would not lead to true insight which he sought. He thus set off on his own to find a different path to wisdom.

Siddʰārtʰa finally settled down to meditate beneath a pipal tree (ficus religiōsa). He remained there for 40 nights, undeterred by the temptations of Māra (the "Lord of the Senses"). During these meditations Siddʰārtʰa came to understand the Four Noble Truths, and he attained enlightenment on the night of the first full moon in May (Vesakʰa). He emerged from these meditations as the true Buddha, the Enlightened, and the traditional name bodʰi ('enlightenment') tree now applied to the pipal serves to commemorate this momentous occasion.

The Buddha subsequently sought five companions and gathered them at Sarnatʰ. There he delivered to them his first sermon, in which he rejected the two extremes of his life experience --- extreme self-indulgence and extreme self-deprivation; he stressed the search for a middle path between these two extremes, one which would ultimately lead to true wisdom and nirvāṇa. This path has come down to us as the Eightfold Way and consists of right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right living, right endeavor, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

The Buddha's Legacy
With these first five disciples the Buddha founded the saṅgʰa ('congratation' or '(monastic) order'). He thereby established a vehicle through which his teachings might disseminate further. This completed the Buddha's earthly mission, and at Kusinara he finally escaped the cycle of rebirth and entered parinirvāṇa. This occurred on the day of the full moon in May (Vesakʰa). His body was cremated and the remains spread as relics throughout the various Buddhist communities.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following Tocharian B text is B107, now THT 107 in the new Berlin numbering system. This was the first Tocharian B text of the Berlin collection published by Sieg and Siegling. We follow the edition published by Pinault (2008).

The selection below provides the beginning of a Tocharian translation of the story traditionally referred to as the "Last Supper" of the Buddha before his enlightenment. In particular, the story relates the scene that begins after Siddʰārtʰa's departure from the company of the five ascetics whose practices of self-deprivation he had previously been observing. He decides to restore his strength with a suitable meal, and in preparation he travels to the river Nairañjanā to bathe. He dons there new clothes and receives from two women the food he seeks. They provide him the food in a bowl, and in the presence of the nourishment he allows himself to contemplate the nature of the world. Here is where our passage picks up.

26 Personal Pronouns
Tocharian maintains specific pronouns for the first and second persons. For the third person the situation parallels that of Proto-Indo-European: no specific pronoun denotes uniquely the third person, but rather the Tocharian languages employ demonstrative adjectives as substantives. In addition to these independent pronominal forms, the Tocharian languages also employ suffixed forms which borrow their accent from the word to which they are attached.

26.1 Independent Forms
Tocharian shows a pronoun for the first person ('I', 'we'), and a separate pronoun for the second person ('thou', 'you'). What comes as a surprise from the Indo-European point of view is that, in Tocharian A, the first person pronoun distinguishes for gender in the singular. That is, the forms expressing English 'I' or 'me' or '(of) me' differ depending on whether 'I' am male or female. We do not find this elsewhere in the ancient Indo-European languages. Tocharian B does not share this distinction, nor does the second person pronoun in either language. The following chart displays the extant forms of the first and second pronouns in each of Tocharian A and B.

 	 	A 1 Masc.	 	 	 	A 1 Fem.	 	B 1	 	 	 	 	 	A 2	 	B 2
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	näṣ	 	 	 	ñuk	 	ñäś (ñiś)	 	 	 	 	 	tu	 	t(u)we
G	 	ñi	 	 	 	nāñi	 	ñi	 	 	 	 	 	tñi	 	tañ
Obl.	 	näṣ	 	 	 	ñuk	 	ñäś (ñiś)	 	 	 	 	 	cu	 	ci
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Paral	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	wene	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	yene
Obl.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	wene	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	yene
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	 	 	was	 	 	 	wes	 	 	 	 	 	yas	 	yes
G	 	 	 	wasäṃ	 	 	 	wesi, wesäṃ, wesäñ	 	 	 	 	 	yasäṃ	 	yesi, yesäṃ, yesäñ
Obl.	 	 	 	was	 	 	 	wes	 	 	 	 	 	yas	 	yes
The historical development of the first person singular remains opaque. One might suppose two Proto-Tocharian forms, *ñäś and *ñäku, the latter a marked version of the former (Pinault 2008). *ñäś would give the masculine form by dissimilation (cf. Pinault 2008, Adams 1988); the marked form evidently came in restricted context to mark the feminine. Beyond that, little is clear about the development of the first person singular.

The development of the second person singular provides fewer difficulties. The following chart illustrates the evolution from Proto-Indo-European.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	*tuHom	 	*tuwæ	 	tu	 	t(u)we
G	 	 	 	*täñ-i	 	tñi	 	tañ
Obl.	 	*twe	 	*tywyä	 	cu	 	ci
Though the exact origin of the genitive form remains unclear, the nominative and oblique forms derive straightforwardly from their PIE counterparts.

The development of the plural forms likewise contains some twists and turns. Evidently we find alteration of the accusative form to conform with the nominative: PIE *nos should give PToch *næ(s), but this became *wæ(s) to parallel the *w- of the nominative form; similarly PIE *wos > PToch *wæ(s) was reformed as *yæ(s). The accusative forms PToch *wæ(s) and *yæ(s) provided a base which Tocharian extended throughout the remainder of the paradigm. Interestingly, we find that Tocharian retains the final *-s of these forms, suggesting the influence of a suffixed particle. We find similar extension by suffixed particles in the genitive, where evidently Tocharian B has imported the same suffix *-ñ(ä) found in the second person genitive singular. The PIE source of the suffix in Tocharian A was-äṃ and yas-äṃ may lie in the ending *-min found, e.g., in Greek hēmĩn, humĩn and Skt. tasmin; in Tocharian, assimilation would yield *-nin > *-nä(n) > A -äṃ. The forms B wes-i, yes-i likely preserve a later formation, recharacterizing these forms with the genitive ending -i found commonly among the pronominal declensions.

Tocharian also preserves a reflexive pronoun A ṣñi B ṣañ, both forms evidently deriving from PToch *ṣäñ. The Tocharian A form shows the ending -i characteristic of the genitive. The reflexive pronoun recapitulates the topic (usually the subject) of the sentence, much as English himself, herself, itself, themselves.

26.2 Suffixed Forms
In addition to the independent forms discussed above, Tocharian possesses enclitic forms of the pronoun for the first, second, and third persons. The following table lists the forms.

 	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-ñi	 	-ñ
2	 	-ci	 	-c
3	 	-ṃ	 	-ne
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-m	 	-me
2	 	-m	 	-me
3	 	-m	 	-me
To these forms Tocharian may append the secondary case endings to express the specific grammatical relation intended. For example, third person singular allative A -n-ac B -ne-ś, second person singular ablative B -c-meṃ, etc.

We see that the same form A -m B -me serves for all persons in the plural. The Tocharian A forms display the genitive ending -i familiar from the personal and demonstrative pronouns. Scholars still dispute the origins of the individual forms. Most clear is the development of the second person singular form from the original PIE enclitic form *te > PToch *cä (+i) > A -ci B -c. The first person singular form likely has its origins in PIE *me, but with an analogical replacement of *m- with *ñ- based on the forms of the independent pronouns. The third person singular form perhaps derives from an early PIE deictic pronoun stem *no- > *næ. The origin of the plural pronominal form still remains obscure.

These suffixes form part of the phonological word to which they are suffixed. We see this in the shifts in vocalism that accompany the shifts in accent which these forms engender. For example, consider the verb B läk- 'see'. This has third person singular preterite form lyāka < PToch *lyā́kā 'she saw'. If however we express the idea 'she saw him' with the same verb and a pronominal suffix, we find PToch *lyākā́-ne > B lyakā-ne. The extra syllable provided by the pronominal suffix brings about a shift in the Tocharian B accent, and the results in an alternation between a and ā.

27 Primary Case Endings: Plural
We finally turn to the plural endings of the primary cases, thereby completing our detailed discussion of the nominal endings. Recall that in Lesson 2, Section 7.1.1 we distinguished two broad classes into which we may divide Tocharian nouns:

Type (a)	 	nominative plural	 	 	 	 	 	different from	 	 	 	 	 	oblique plural;
Type (b)	 	nominative plural	 	 	 	 	 	same as	 	 	 	 	 	oblique plural.
Generally speaking, we could divide nouns in any case-marking language this way: we are simply distinguishing two logical possibilities. What makes this distinction more interesting is the fact that each type listed above contains a large number of representatives, so that this provides a useful distinction within Tocharian in particular.

The question then arises: is there any way to know what nouns fall into Type (a) and what nouns into Type (b)? The remarkable fact is that the answer is rather simple if we think in terms of PIE. In PIE, the distinction of Types (a) and (b) coincides with the distinction between non-neuter and neuter, as shown in the following chart.

 	 	Athem. Pl.	 	Them. Pl.
Non-Neuter	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	*-es	 	*-ōs < *-o-es
Acc.	 	*-ns	 	*-o-ns
 	 	 	 	 
Neuter	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā < *-e-H₂
Acc.	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā < *-e-H₂
We see this, for example, in Greek, Latin and Sanskrit: nouns whose nominative and accusative are identical are generally neuter, and those for which these forms are different are generally masculine or feminine. In terms of Tocharian, the alternating gender retains the remnants of the original PIE neuter. We therefore expect Type (b) to consist largely of nouns with alternating gender. Moreover, we specifically expect their plural endings to reflect those of the original PIE neuter plural.

The flip side of course is that we should expect Type (a) to reflect nouns which were originally non-neuter in PIE terms. That is, Type (a) nouns should largely consist of masculine or feminine nouns in Tocharian, and their plural endings should reflect the original PIE non-neuter (animate) endings.

In large part this correlation between alternating gender and Type (b) nouns holds true. We do however find deviations from this pattern: on the one hand, the PIE feminine may at least in part have derived from collective neuters, so that these two genders have a very intricate relationship within PIE itself; on the other hand, within the Tocharian family itself analogical extension of inherited patterns need not confine itself to gender categories. Thus both on historical grounds in terms of PIE and on the grounds of natural linguistic evolution, we do not expect a strict demarcation confining a particular gender to a particular declensional Type. In particular in addition to nouns with alternating gender we would expect to find feminine nouns that behave according to Type (b).

Nouns of Type (b) generally pertain to Classes I--III, while nouns of Type (a) generally pertain to Classes IV--VII.

27.1 Type (b): Nominative Same as Oblique
Ultimately, as discussed above, plural endings where the nominative and oblique are the same derive historically from the PIE neuter plural ending: PIE *-H₂ > PToch *-ā. The variety of Type (b) endings we actually encounter in the documented Tocharian languages can be traced back in large part to the corresponding variety of suffixes we find in neuter, or inanimate, noun formation in PIE. In particular, we find reflexes of neuter plurals built to root nouns, as well as *u-, *n-, and *nt-stems. The following chart lists the historical evolution into Tocharian of the PIE neuter nominative/accusative ending in the instance of each suffix.

PIE Type	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B	 	Noun Class
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*Ø-Stem	 	*-H₂	 	*-ā	 	-ā	 	-a	 	I.1
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*u-Stem	 	*-u-H₂	 	*-wā	 	-u	 	-wa	 	I.2
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*n-Stem	 	*-n-H₂	 	*-nā	 	-äṃ	 	-na	 	II.1
 	 	*-m(e)n-H₂	 	*-m(ä)nā	 	 	 	-m(a)na	 	II.1
 	 	*-m(e)n-H₂	 	*-mnā	 	-mnā	 	-nma	 	II.2
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*nt-Stem	 	*-nt-H₂	 	*-ntā	 	-nt	 	-nta	 	III
We see that the PIE stem type generally dictates the noun declension class as outlined in standard grammars of Tocharian. In large part, the evolution appears completely regular. Perhaps the most conspicuous seeming irregularity is that the root noun (*Ø-stem) reflex in Tocharian A is -ā. We should expect -Ø in accordance with the general loss of final vowels in Tocharian A. Two possible explanations come to mind. First, had Tocharian A reduced the ending to -Ø, for a large number of nouns this would have removed the sole marker of the plural number. Second, and likely related, is the fact that this ending would have remained even on phonetic grounds in some very common formations. In particular, the plural oblique provides the base for adjectives formed by means of the suffix A -ṣi B -ṣṣe (Lesson 3, Section 13.2). Since the neuter ending would no longer have been final, it would have remained in these formations, perhaps providing further impetus to retain the *-ā in the regular nominal paradigm. Consider the following example showing the evolution of the noun A pukäl B pikul 'year'.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
Noun	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sg.	 	*pékʷ-ḷ-Ø	 	*p'äkwäl	 	pukäl	 	pikul
Pl.	 	*pekʷ-l-H₂	 	*p'äkwälā	 	puklā	 	pikwala
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Adjective	 	*pekʷ-l-H₂ + -syo-	 	*p'äkwälā-syæ	 	puklā-ṣi	 	pikwala-ṣṣe
In the uncompounded form, the final -ā should be lost in Tocharian A; the fact that it remains in the compounded form provides the foundation for analogical restoration in the nominal paradigm.

In the *u-stem nouns we find the expected loss of the final *-H₂ > *-ā in the plural. Take for example the noun A waṣt B ost 'house' (cf. Gk. (w)ástu, Ved. vā́stu).

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
Noun	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sg.	 	*wā́stu-Ø	 	*wåstä	 	waṣt	 	ost
Pl.	 	*wā́stu-H₂	 	*wåstuwā	 	waṣtu	 	ost(u)wa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Adjective	 	*wā́stu-H₂ + -syo-	 	*wåstuwā-syæ	 	waṣt(w)ā-ṣi	 	ost(w)a-ṣṣe
We see in the above example that, due to the loss of the final vowel in the plural, the original PIE stem itself becomes the plural marker in Tocharian A. As before, the *-ā is retained in composition. But since the stem itself is lost in the singular, the stem alone is sufficient to mark the plural, and so the *-ā is not restored by analogy. Moreover, Tocharian A begins to extend the use of this new plural marker beyond its historical distribution to nouns of differing gender and etymological formation. For example, Tocharian A employs this ending with nouns with stem-final -E, including a number of non-neuter nouns: A pe (masculine) 'foot', plural peyu; A kälyme (feminine) 'direction', plural kälymeyu.

The remaining stems listed above undergo a similar process. What we find in Tocharian as the marker of the plural in fact derives from the original stem suffix: the *Ø-ending in the singular generally precipitates loss of the suffix itself in Tocharian A; but the addition (and subsequent loss) of the *-H₂ in the plural actually preserves the stem. The latter, together with the original ending if it survives, is reanalyzed synchronically as the marker of the plural, and this marker spreads beyond its historical distribution.

The evolution among the *n-stems therefore brings little surprise; the overall process largely parallels that described above. We do notice some peculiarities however. One is that which Tocharian nouns exhibit PIE *n- or *m(e)n-stem reflexes generally differs between Tocharian A and B. Consider the examples of A ysār B yasar (alternating) 'blood', A ñom B ñem (alternating) 'name' listed below.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sg.	 	*H₁esH₂ōr-Ø	 	*yäsār	 	ysār	 	yasar	 	Lat. as(s)er
Pl.	 	*H₁esH₂ōr-H₂	 	*yäsārā	 	ysāräṃ	 	ysāra	 	Gk. éar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Sg.	 	*H₁nēmṇ-Ø	 	*ñæmä(n)	 	ñom	 	ñem	 	Lat. nōmen, pl. nōmina
Pl.	 	*H₁nēmṇ-H₂	 	*ñæmnā	 	ñomäntu	 	ñemna	 	 
In the example of A ysār B yasar we find that Tocharian A shows a reflex of the *n-suffix, though grafted onto the original collective formation in *-ōr. With A ñom B ñem we see that Tocharian B preserves the original *m(e)n-suffix and ending in the plural, while Tocharian A reforms the plural based on a suffix imported from elsewhere.

We also find in some instances metathesis of the *m and *n of the suffix: PToch *-mn- > *-nm-. This often occurred when the suffix followed a root-final consonant: *-C-mn-H₂ > *-C-ä-mnā > *-C-ä-nmā. This occurs in particular with *nākänmā > B nakanma, plural of B naki, verbal derivative of the root AB nāk- 'blame'.

The simple *n-stem reflex, PIE *-n-H₂ > PToch *-nā, bolstered by a reanalysis of the *m(e)n-suffix as PIE *-mn-H₂ > PToch *-m-nā, occasioned the extension of the new Tocharian suffix *-nā to plurals of other categories. In particular the new ending spread among nouns to feminine plurals where normal phonetic evolution caused the nominative and accusative forms to converge. Consider the example of A śäṃ B śana 'wife'.

 	 	PIE	 	Late PIE	 	PToch	 	Late PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B	 	Comparanda
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N	 	*gʷen-eH₂	 	*gʷenā	 	*śänå	 	*śänå	 	śäṃ	 	śana	 	Got. qino
Obl.	 	*gʷen-eH₂-m	 	*gʷenām	 	*śänå	 	*śänå	 	śäṃ	 	śano	 	Gk. gunḗ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N	 	*gʷen-eH₂-es	 	*gʷenās	 	*śänå	 	*śänå+nā	 	śnu	 	śnona	 	 
Obl.	 	*gʷen-eH₂-ns	 	*gʷenās	 	*śänå	 	*śänå+nā	 	śnās	 	śnona	 	 
We see that, in order to distinguish the plural from the singular, Tocharian B has imported the new plural suffix *-nā appropriate to nouns whose plural nominative and accusative are identical. Tocharian A faced the same problem, but found a different resolution. Along the same lines, both Tocharian A and Tocharian B have imported the neuter ending PToch *-nā > A -äṃ B -na into the plural nominative and oblique of feminine thematic adjectives: *-ās > PToch *-å > *-å+nā > A -aṃ B -ona.

The *nt-stem reflexes derive largely from PIE formations in *-e/ont- followed by the neuter plural suffix: *-e/ont-H₂. This suffix occurs not only among the substantives, but in the feminine plural of certain common adjectives: for example A pont B ponta, feminine plural of A puk B po 'all, every'; and A krant B krenta, feminine plural of A kāsu B kartse 'good'. As with other endings discussed above, the sequence *-äntā composed of PIE suffix and ending was reanalyzed as a unit representing the plural ending, and this was extended in Proto-Tocharian beyond its original distribution. In particular it forms a plural to nouns ending in consonants, e.g. *wär-äntā > B wranta, as well as to nouns ending in vowels, providing numerous combinations B -Vnta, where V can be any one of A a, u or B ā, e, i, o, u. In Tocharian A in particular, the stem *-nt- seems to have been augmented by the plural formation -wā discussed in connection with the *u-stems. This has left a variant plural formation *-nt-wā > A -ntu in Tocharian A. The final semivowel often maintains a certain now-you-see-it-now-you-don't quality: Tocharian A plurals in A often show -äntw- in the secondary case formations. Consider the example of A el 'gift', with plural elant, as in the following chart.

27.2 Type (a): Nominative Different from Oblique
27.2.1 Various Nominative Endings

In those nouns for which the nominative and oblique plural differ in form, the endings of the nominative plural show a wide variety of sources and outcomes. With the exclusion of the nominative plural endings A -e B -i (without palatalization of preceding consonants), which derive from an originally pronominal ending *-y in PIE, the remaining Tocharian endings trace their origin to the common animate nominative plural ending *-es. The resulting variety of Tocharian endings therefore has its source not in the PIE endings, but rather in the PIE suffixes to which they were attached, and the ensuing effects this had on the phonetic development within Tocharian. We list these combinations in the following chart, noting both the noun and adjective classes that characteristically employ the respective Tocharian endings.

PIE Type	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B	 	Noun Class	 	Adj Class
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pronoun	 	*-oy	 	*-æy	 	-e	 	-i	 	V.1	 	I
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*i-Stem	 	*-ey-es	 	*-yäyä	 	-yi	 	-yi	 	V.2--3	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*u-Stem	 	*-ew-es	 	*-yäwyä	 	 	 	-yi	 	V.2--3	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*n-Stem	 	*-n-es	 	*-ñä	 	-ñ	 	-ñ	 	 	 	 
 	 	*-on-es	 	*-æñä	 	-añ	 	-eñ	 	V.1 (A), VI.4 (B)	 	II.4
 	 	*-en-es	 	*-yäñä	 	-yiñ	 	-yiñ	 	VI.1	 	II.1
 	 	*-ōn-es	 	*-āñä	 	-āñ	 	-āñ	 	VI.3	 	II.3
 	 	*-ōn-es	 	*-āñä	 	 	 	-ai+ñ	 	VI.2	 	II.2
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*nt-Stem	 	*-nt-es	 	*-ñcä	 	-ñś	 	-ñc	 	VII	 	III
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*s-Stem	 	*-s-es	 	*-ṣä	 	-ṣ	 	-ṣ	 	 	 	IV
We see that, in large part, the suffixes recapitulate those we have seen with nouns of Type (b). We do notice some differences however. In particular, the *i- and *u-stems show the full grade of the thematic vowel *-e-. This has the expected effect of palatalizing the preceding consonant; thus Tocharian nouns employing the reflexes of these endings typically show palatalization of the stem-final consonant. Moreover, we find a wide array of PIE *n-stem formations that give rise to Type (a) endings. These employ *o-grade as well as *e-grade, the latter of course palatalizing root-final consonants; we find the long *ō-grade *n-stem formations, which happens to provide a variety of outcomes in Tocharian B: B -āñ vs. B -ai+ñ. We also note that the PIE ending *-es has the predictable effect of palatalizing the suffix-final consonant; in regard to the *nt-stems, this palatalization affects the entire consonant cluster. The *s-stem formation generally arises not only in stems in *-e/os-, but also in the preterite participles based on the stem *-wos-.

We do find a slight departure from the above pattern with adjectives from class II.5, where the expected nominative singular *-mōn-es > PToch *-māñ has been reformed as B -moñ in accord with the o-vocalism of the nominative singular (Lesson 4, Section 18).

27.2.2 Oblique Ending

Happily the oblique plural ending has a unique source in the Proto-Indo-European accusative plural: PIE *-ns > PToch *-ns > A -s B -ṃ. The variation we find in the oblique plural endings within the two Tocharian languages confines itself to the vowel preceding these endings. For original consonant stems, an epenthetic *-ä- arises to break up consonant clusters. For PIE *i- and *u-stems, the same reduced vowel arises due to the regular change *i, u > *ä. For original thematic stems, the PIE thematic vowel *-o- gives the expected PToch *-æ-. We summarize the situation in the following chart.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Athematic	 	*-C-ns	 	*-Cäns	 	-äs	 	-äṃ
 	 	*-i-ns	 	*-yäns	 	-yäs	 	-yäṃ
 	 	*-u-ns	 	*-äns	 	-äs	 	-äṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Thematic	 	*-o-ns	 	*-æns	 	-as	 	-eṃ
Consider the following example of A yuk B yakwe 'horse'.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	*H₁eḱwo-n-es	 	*yäkwæñä	 	yukañ	 	 
 	 	*H₁eḱwo-y	 	*yäkwæy	 	 	 	yakwi
Acc.	 	*H₁eḱwo-ns	 	*yäkwæns	 	yukas	 	yakweṃ
In many situations, where the nominative plural shows -Vñ for some vowel V, Tocharian A has adopted the same vowel in the oblique: -Vs.

27.3 Genitive Plural
We find in Tocharian a total of three different genitive plural endings. Tocharian A employs two distinct endings: A -śśi for Type (a) and (b) substantives and adjectives, A -is for Type (b) substantives. Tocharian B is mercifully straightforward, employing only the suffix B -ṃts, which it sometimes further simplifies to B -ts.

The origins of these endings remain somewhat obscure. The ending A -śśi likely derives from the oblique plural ending -s, augmented by the possessive suffix -śi found among the adjectives, followed by the attendant palatalization. This fits with the fact that this ending most commonly occurs with those substantives whose nominative and oblique plural differ (Type (a)), hence with those whose oblique plural ending is A -s. The ending also occurs with those substantives and adjectives whose nominative and oblique plural are identical (Type (b)); when this happens, Tocharian A appends the ending to the nominative/oblique plural form. Consider the following examples.

Toch A	 	Nom. Sg.	 	Nom Pl.	 	Obl. Pl.	 	Gen. Pl.
Type (a)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
'horse'	 	yuk	 	yukañ	 	yukas	 	yukaśśi
'living being'	 	wrasom	 	wrasam'	 	wrasas	 	wrasaśśi
'king'	 	wäl	 	lā(ṃ)ś	 	lāñcäs	 	lāñcäśśi
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Type (b)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
'thing'	 	wram	 	*wramnā > wramäṃ	 	wramäṃ	 	wramnāśśi
'good deed'	 	kāswone	 	*kāswonentwā > kāswonentu	 	kāswonentu	 	kāswonentwāśśi
Note that the stem to which -śśi is appended often recapitulates the Proto-Tocharian form, since addition of the genitive plural ending prevents loss of the final vowel.

The ending A -is likely derives from the genitive singular ending (see Section 17.4.2 of Lesson 4): PIE *-ns-os > PToch -änsæ > A -is. Tocharian A likewise appends this to the nominative/oblique plural of Type (b) nouns, in particular those which form plural in -äntu: A cmol 'birth', nom./obl. plural cmolu, gen. plural cmolwis; A pāk 'portion', nom./obl. plural pākäntu, gen. plural pākäntwis.

The ending B -(ṃ)ts likely derives from the *n-stem genitive singular recharacterized by appending the ending of the genitive plural: PIE *-ns-ōm > *-nsu > *-nsä > B -ṃts. Such evolution might also explain the occurrence of a variant long form B -ṃtso found in poetic meter; this form preserves the original final syllable whose presence is confirmed by the placement of the accent: e.g. B yäkwéṃts < *yäkwéntsä. Among the Type (b) nouns (classes I--III), Tocharian B appends this ending to the -a of the nominative/oblique ending: B ñem 'name', nom./obl. plural ñemna, gen. plural ñemnaṃts; B camel 'birth', nom./obl. plural cmela, gen. plural cmelaṃts.

28 Adjective Class IV: Athematic *s-Stems, Preterite Participle
Class IV comprises athematic adjectives deriving from original PIE *s-stems: the Tocharian preterite participle. In particular, the source for these adjectival paradigms lies with the PIE perfect participle in *-wos-, with feminine *-us-iH₂-; cf. Gr. -(w)ṓs, -uĩa, respectively. Although the Class IV adjectives fall into four main subgroups in Tocharian B (mercifully, only two in Tocharian A), the forms within a given paradigm exhibit quite a bit of regularity. Ironically, this regularity in synchronic formation hides seeming irregularities in the historical evolution of the forms. Some scholars note the intrusion of forms in -nt- and suggest that this might hint at an origin in the PIE aorist participle in *-nt-; this remains a point of scholarly debate.

In those masculine forms where the final sibilant of *-wos- remains, we find the palatalization which we would expect in forms such as the nominative plural (*-wos-es > PToch *-wæsyä > B -weṣ) or even the dative singular, ultimately co-opted in the genitive (*-wos-ey > PToch *-wæsyäy > B *-weṣi > -weṣ-epi). From such forms the palatalized -ṣ- may have spread throughout the masculine paradigm. But we find a conspicuous lack of palatalization in the sibilant of the feminine declension. A possible explanation (Pinault 2008) lies in a combination of two factors: (1) *-i- does not necessarily palatalize the preceding consonant, in particular a sibilant (cf. Section 11.5.1 of Lesson 3); (2) the sequence *-iH₂-m may remain as *-īm in Proto-Tocharian. The combination of these factors would allow the development *-us-iH₂-m > PToch *-usīm > *-usi of the feminine accusative singular, from which the unpalatalized -s- may have spread through the rest of the feminine paradigm.

Though the historical evolution remains problematic, the declension is rather straightforward; this is in contrast to the general impression left by Tocharian, where straightforward historical evolution leads to rather idiosyncratic declension patterns. We illustrate the declension of adjectives of Type I with the verb AB yām- 'make'.

Type I	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	yāmu	 	yāmus	 	 	 	 	 	yāmu	 	yāmusa

Obl.	 	yāmuñcäs	 	yāmunt	 	 	 	 	 	yāmoṣäṃ	 	yām(u)wa
The verb AB lä-n-t- 'depart' provides an illustration of Type II declension.

Type II	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine

G	 	lantuntāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ltuweṣepi	 	 
Obl.	 	lantunt	 	lantusāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	ltuweṣ	 	ltusai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	lantuṣ	 	lantunt	 	 	 	 	 	ltuweṣ	 	ltuwa

Obl.	 	lantuñcäs	 	lantunt	 	 	 	 	 	ltuweṣäṃ	 	ltuwa
We illustrate Type III declension with the verb AB kälp- 'obtain'.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine

G	 	kälpontāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	kälpoṣepi	 	 
Obl.	 	kälpont	 	kälposāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	kälpoṣ	 	kälpausai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	kälpoṣ	 	kälpont	 	 	 	 	 	kälpoṣ	 	kälpauwa

Obl.	 	kälpoñcäs	 	kälpont	 	 	 	 	 	kälpoṣäṃ	 	kälpauwa
The verb AB pik- 'paint, write' serves to illustrate Type IV declension.

Type IV	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	pāpeku	 	pāpekus	 	 	 	 	 	papaikau	 	papaikausa
G	 	pāpekuntāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	papaikaṣepi	 	 
Obl.	 	pāpekunt	 	pāpekusāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	papaikaṣ	 	papaikausai
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	pāpekuṣ	 	pāpekunt	 	 	 	 	 	papaikaṣ	 	papaikauwa
G	 	pāpekuñcäśśi	 	*pāpekuntāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	papaikaṣäṃts	 	papaikauwaṃts
Obl.	 	pāpekuñcäs	 	pāpekunt	 	 	 	 	 	papaikaṣäṃ	 	papaikauwa
Reduplication occurs with some verbs in Type I past participles; it occurs with all verbs in Type IV past participles. Those verbs whose past participles form according to Types II or III do not exhibit reduplication.

We also see from the above declension patterns that Types I, II and IV are identical in Tocharian A. That is, Tocharian A only shows two declension patterns: Type I-II-IV vs. Type III. Tocharian B shows a distinction between all four classes. Historically the distinction likely arises from the environment preceding the *-wos- suffix (Pinault 2008):

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	 	 	Toch B
Type I	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Sg.	 	*-C-uwōs	 	*-Cäwo	 	*-C(ä)wu	 	*-Cwu	 	-Cu
Nom. Pl.	 	*-C-uwos-es	 	*-Cäwæṣä	 	*-Coṣä	 	*-Coṣ	 	-Coṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Type II	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Sg.	 	*-C-uwōs	 	*-Cäwo	 	*-Cúwo	 	*-Cúwu	 	-Cu
Nom. Pl.	 	*-C-uwos-es	 	*-Cäwæṣä	 	*-Cuwæṣä	 	*-Cuweṣä	 	-Cuweṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Type III	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Sg.	 	*-ā-wōs	 	*-åwo	 	*-åwu	 	*-au	 	-au
Nom. Pl.	 	*-ā-wos-es	 	*-åwæṣä	 	*-åṣä	 	*-oṣ	 	-oṣ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Type IV	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom. Sg.	 	*-H-wōs	 	*-āwo	 	*-āwu	 	*-au	 	-au
Nom. Pl.	 	*-H-wos-es	 	*-āwæṣä	 	*-āṣä	 	*-aṣ	 	-aṣ
We see a distinction between Type I and Type II depending on whether *-ä- carried the Proto-Tocharian accent or not in the nominative singular. We find in Type III the contraction *-åwæ- > *-å-, and in Type IV the contraction *-āwæ- > *-ā-. The point of departure for the Type IV declension appears to be the introduction of root-final -ā-, in origin the root-final laryngeal that was extended in Proto-Tocharian to a general marker of the preterite.

29 Subjunctive
As with the eponymous formation in Proto-Indo-European, the Tocharian subjunctive generally denotes a possible situation or action, that is, a situation or action that does not yet bear the status of a fact from the point of view of the speaker. In this regard it comes as little surprise that in Tocharian the subjunctive often serves as a future tense, inasmuch as future actions, by definition, do not have the status of fact... yet.

In terms of Tocharian morphology, we find a remarkable situation: the Tocharian subjunctive follows exactly the same paradigms as the present. That is to say, the Tocharian subjunctive falls into the same classes as the present, and employs the same endings. What then distinguishes the subjunctive from the present? Well, if a Tocharian verb forms its present according to some CLASS M, in general it will form its subjunctive according to another CLASS N, where M and N are different. That is, a Tocharian verb does not take both its present and its subjunctive from the same class. However, if it forms a CLASS N subjunctive, then the subjunctive conjugation is identical to how verbs with CLASS N presents conjugate their present.

WARNING: the above is only true up to a point. The preceding explanation is somewhat overly simplistic. However there is a reason for this: in broad outline it serves as a very good characterization. Overall there is no formal distinction between the present and the subjunctive. The distinction is handled on a verb-by-verb basis. Moreover, since the paradigms for the subjunctive are the same as those for the present, it is standard practice for grammars of Tocharian to omit subjunctive paradigms altogether. This practice will generally be followed here, with the hope that the reasoning has been made fairly clear (not always so in grammars of Tocharian!).

The chart below illustrates the correspondences between present and subjunctive classes in Tocharian. Consider the third person singular (active or mediopassive, depending on what survives in the documents) of both the present and subjunctive for the verbs AB pik- 'write, paint' < PIE *peiǵ-, A kum- B käm- 'come' < PIE *gʷem-, and A klyos- B klyaus- 'hear' < PIE *ḱleus-.

Root	 	Present (Class)	 	Subjunctive (Class)
 	 	 	 	 
A pik-	 	pikäṣ (I)	 	pekatär (v)
B pik-	 	piṅkäṃ (VII)	 	paikatär (v)
 	 	 	 	 
A kum-	 	kumnäṣ (X)	 	śmäṣ (ii)
B käm-	 	känmaṣṣäṃ (X)	 	śamäṃ (ii)
 	 	 	 	 
A klyos-	 	klyoṣtär (II)	 	klyoṣäṣ (ii)
B klyaus-	 	klyauṣäṃ (II)	 	klyauṣäṃ (ii)
With pik- we find a CLASS I present in Tocharian A, while a CLASS VII present in Tocharian B; both languages however form the subjunctive by conjugating according to the pattern of present CLASS V. With A kum- B käm-, both languages derive the present from CLASS X and the subjunctive from CLASS ii. Finally, the example of A klyos- B klyaus- hopefully clears up all doubt as to whether the subjunctive classes are truly formed the same as the corresponding present classes: Tocharian A and B both draw the present from CLASS II and the subjunctive from CLASS ii; since the classes are formally the same, the present and subjunctive forms for this verb are indistinguishable.

The true state of affairs is that the Tocharian subjunctive falls into three broad types:

Those subjunctive classes which actually have no analogue in the present classes;
Those subjunctive classes which only show stem ablaut different from that of the corresponding present classes;
Those subjunctive classes which are completely formally identical to the corresponding present classes.
Two subjunctive classes fall into the first type, two fall into the second type, and the remaining classes fall into the third type. Thus the lion's share of subjunctive classes does in fact correspond exactly to present classes, and so the above simplified explanation largely holds true.

29.1 Special Subjunctive Classes: iv, vii
29.1.1 Special Subjunctive Class iv

CLASS iv subjunctives occur only in Tocharian B, and rarely at that. The suffix -i- distinguishes the class. This marker, being the same as the general optative marker, leads to confusion between subjunctive and optative forms. A likely source for the suffix is PIE *-ye/o-; roots may show either zero grade, e.g. B wṣītsi 'to abide' < PIE *us-ye/o-, or full grade, e.g. B kälypītsi 'to steal' < PIE *ḱlep-ye/o- (cf. Gk. kléptō 'I steal'). Palatalization of the preceding consonant occurs as a result of the suffix; note that this palatalization pervades the entire paradigm, not restricting itself only to those forms whose thematic vowel was PIE *-e-.

The verbs B wäs- 'abide' and B ākl- 'learn' serve to illustrate the forms of CLASS iv subjunctives.

29.1.1 Special Subjunctive Class vii

CLASS vii subjunctives employ the thematic suffix -ñ-. This occurs in both Tocharian A and B, though rarely in the latter, and most commonly with causatives in Tocharian A. Though a thematic suffix, and therefore only properly palatalized when followed by *-e-, the -ñ-suffix has extended throughout the paradigm, and shows no depalatalized reflexes. Subjunctive CLASS vii and present CLASS XII (suffix -(ä)ññ-) remain distinct: the gemination in present CLASS XII (from *-n(H)-ye-) does not occur in subjunctive CLASS vii.

The verbs AB we- 'say, speak' (in Tocharian A with suppletive present träṅk-) and A nāk- 'condemn' illustrate the forms of subjunctive CLASS vii.

29.2 Varying Subjunctive Classes: i, v
The term varying, or alternating, in regard to subjunctive classes refers more specifically to the variation, or ablaut, of the original root vowel in Proto-Indo-European. Specifically, the varying subjunctive classes show remnants of PIE *o-grade in the active singular, and PIE Ø-grade elsewhere. As the Greek verb leípō 'I leave' illustrates,

Stem	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Perfect
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
lip-	 	leípō	 	élipon	 	léloipa
the *o-grade provides the hallmark of the PIE perfect. The Sanskrit forms

Skt. Perfect	 	Active Sg.	 	Active Pl.
gam- 'go'	 	 	 	 
1	 	jagāma	 	jagmima
2	 	jagantʰa	 	jagma
3	 	jagāma	 	jagmur
show the typical alternation between strong and weak forms in the perfect, that is, full- or lengthened-grade in the active singular, and zero grade elsewhere. The ablaut of the varying subjunctive classes in Tocharian therefore most resembles that of the PIE perfect.

29.2.1 Varying Subjunctive Class i

CLASS i subjunctives do not show the reflex *ä and accompanying palatalization of the root-final consonant that occurs with the PIE thematic vowel -*e-. Moreover this subjunctive class lacks in Tocharian A the -a- < PToch *-æ- < PIE *-o- preceding the active first person singular ending -m; whereas Tocharian B employs the ending -u rather than -au. For these reasons scholars term CLASS i subjunctives athematic; this incidentally highlights the fact that the Tocharian subjunctive typically does not continue the original PIE subjunctive, since the latter is a thematic formation.

As in the present CLASS I, however, we do find the intrusion of some thematic endings: e.g. active third person plural A -eñc (compare A -iñc in the present) and B -eṃ. To illustrate the conjugation of verbs in this class, we list below forms pertaining to the roots A e- B ai- 'give' < PToch *āi- < PIE *H₂ei- and AB pärk- 'ask' < PToch *pärk- < PIE *pṛḱ-.

Subjunctive i	 	A	 	B	 	A	 	B
Active	 	e- 'give'	 	ai- 'give'	 	pärk- 'ask'	 	pärk- 'ask'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	em	 	āyu	 	 	 	preku
2	 	et	 	ait	 	 	 	*prekt(o)
3	 	eṣ	 	aiṃ	 	 	 	prekäṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	emäs	 	aiymo	 	 	 	pärkam(o)
2	 	ec	 	aicer	 	 	 	*parkcer
3	 	āyeñc	 	aiṃ	 	 	 	parkäṃ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infin.	 	 	 	aitsi	 	 	 	parktsi
Grnd. II	 	el	 	aille	 	 	 	parkälle
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Mediopassive	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	 	 	 	 	pärkmār	 	 
2	 	 	 	 	 	pärktär	 	 
3	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2	 	 	 	 	 	pärkcär	 	 
3	 	 	 	 	 	pärkäntär	 	 
The root A e- B ai- remains invariable throughout the paradigm. The paradigm of AB pärk-, on the other hand, shows clearly the *o-grade *proḱ- > PToch *præk- > B prek- in the strong forms (singular active) and the *Ø-grade *pṛḱ- in the weak forms (elsewhere).

29.2.2 Varying Subjunctive Class v

CLASS v subjunctives exhibit the same stem ablaut pattern as those of CLASS i. What distinguishes CLASS v from CLASS i is the additional appearance of a stem-final PToch *-ā-. As with the preterite formation (Lesson 7, Section 34), this stem-final *-ā- derives from the original root-final laryngeal of the verbs forming the core of this class. This *-ā- then extended by analogy to roots which etymologically did not contain a root-final laryngeal. This stem-final *-ā- further affects the *o-grade reflex of the root: the stem-final *-ā- causes umlaut of the root vowel PIE *-o- > PToch *-æ-, resulting in PToch *-ā- root-internally. The following chart illustrates the development and some examples.

Stem	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	*CoR(C)H-	 	*CæR(C)ā-	 	*CāR(C)-ā-	 	*CaR(C)-ā-	 	*CāR(C)-ā-
Weak	 	*CṚ(C)H-	 	*CäR(C)ā-	 	*CäR(C)-ā-	 	*CäR(C)-ā-	 	*CäR(C)-ā-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	*stombʰH-	 	*stæmā-	 	*stām-ā-	 	ṣtam-ā-	 	stām-ā-
Weak	 	*stṃbʰH-	 	*stämā-	 	*stäm-ā-	 	ṣtäm-ā-	 	stäm-ā-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Strong	 	*TorKH₂-	 	*tærkā-	 	*tārk-ā-	 	tark-ā-	 	tārk-ā-
Weak	 	*TṛKH₂-	 	*tärkā-	 	*tärk-ā-	 	tärk-ā-	 	tärk-ā-
In the last example, *T represents an undetermined dental, *K an undetermined velar, consonant. The only reflex of this root outside of Tocharian is Hittite tarna- (with nasal infix), and Hittite orthography leaves the exact nature of these consonants ambiguous. In the Proto-Tocharian period, the root-final *-ā- was reanalyzed as a suffix and extended to roots of similar shape. To illustrate the CLASS v subjunctives, we provide below the forms of AB tärk- 'let go'.

Subjunctive v	 	A	 	B
Active	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	tarkam	 	tārkau
2	 	tarkat	 	tārkat

3	 	tärkeñc	 	tarkaṃ
 	 	 	 	 
Infin.	 	 	 	tarkatsi
Grnd. II	 	tärkāl	 	tarkalle
29.3 Identical Subjunctive Classes: ii, iii, vi, ix-xii
29.3.1 Subjunctive Class ii

CLASS ii subjunctives continue the true tradition of a thematic subjunctive from PIE. That is, the PIE antecedents of verbs with this subjunctive formation show the alternation *-e/o- of the thematic vowel. The verb A kum- B käm- 'come' < PIE *gʷem- provides a good example. Consider the evolution of the following forms.

Theme	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-e-	 	*gʷém-e-	 	*kyämyä-	 	*śämä-	 	śmäṣ	 	śamäṃ
*-o-	 	*gʷém-o-nti	 	*kyämyæntyä	 	*śämæyñc	 	śmeñc	 	 
One finds confusion between presents of CLASS II and subjunctives of CLASS ii. Verbs with CLASS ii subjunctives, however, tend to form presents of CLASS VIII (for the causative), IX or XI, exhibiting -s- or -sk- suffixes.

29.3.2 Subjunctive Class iii

CLASS iii subjunctives, as with presents of the same class, tend to be intransitive and employ mediopassive morphology. They likewise show the thematic *-o- generalized throughout the paradigm. Consider the root PIE *tem- > AB täm- 'be born': PIE *tem-o-tri > PToch *tyäm-æ-tryä > A cmatär B cmetär. Verbs forming CLASS iii subjunctives tend to form presents of CLASS VIII (suffix -s-) or X (suffix -näs(k)-); the forms typically are intransitive with mediopassive morphology.

29.3.3 Subjunctive Class ix

CLASS ix subjunctives employ interestingly enough a suffix A -s- B -sk-. As with the CLASS IX presents, these verbs are usually causative. For the most part CLASS IX presents and CLASS ix subjunctives are indistinct. We do find, however, that Tocharian A CLASS ix subjunctives typically show -ā- rather than -ä- as a linking vowel before the sibilant suffix. For example, A wik- (causative) 'make disappear' forms present (CLASS VIII) active wikäṣ (from *wikṣä-ṣ), but subjunctive (CLASS ix) active wikāsam (1st sg.) and wikāṣ (3rd sg., from *wikāṣä-ṣ).

29.3.4 Subjunctive Classes vi and x-xii

CLASS vi subjunctives employ the suffix *-nā-. In these verbs the association of *-nā- with the perfective aspectual value of the subjunctive likely spurs the formation of the corresponding present by means of an additional PIE iterative suffix *-sḱ-: PIE *-n-H- + -sḱ- > PToch *-nāsk-. That is, verbs forming CLASS vi subjunctives generally form CLASS X presents; consider the following example showing the root PIE (s)peḱ- 'see' > PToch *päk- 'intend, want'.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Subjunctive	 	(s)pḱ-	 	*pk-nā-tär	 	 	 	päknātär
Present	 	(s)pḱ-	 	*pk-nāsk-yä-tär	 	päknāṣtär	 	päknāstär
 	 	 	 	*pk-nāsk-æ-ntär	 	 	 	päknāskentär
Subjunctives of CLASSes x, xi, and xii have sparse attestation. Their formation nevertheless completely parallels that of the corresponding present classes.

30 Instrumental & Causal
The instrumental and causal are the only secondary cases which fail to have representatives in both of the Tocharian languages. In particular, Tocharian A maintains an instrumental case, but lacks a causal; for Tocharian B the opposite situation obtains. This highlights the flexibility still present in the newly restructured case system in Proto-Tocharian: apparently the new secondary cases were not completely fixed by the time the two daughter languages began to diverge.

30.1 Instrumental
The instrumental case arises solely in Tocharian A, marked by the suffix -yo. As the name implies, this case expresses the instrument by means of which an action occurs. Its meaning overlaps with the English preposition with, in the sense of by (means of), as in the English sentences 'I hit the nail with a hammer' or 'I swat at flies with tennis rackets.' Unlike Sanskrit, Tocharian A does not employ the instrumental case to denote accompaniment, as in 'I went to the court with my teddy bear.' The following points provide examples to clarify the use of the Tocharian A instrumental case.

A wsā-yokās pokenyo añcäl pañwäṣ 'he spans the arch with gold-colored arms';
A ṣñi tsaryo elant eṣā 'he gave gifts with his own hand';
A kātkäṣtär-ñi tuṅky=āriñc 'she causes my heart to delight with love';
A plāntac kulenciṃ ñemiyo 'you (pl.) will be pleased by the womanly pearl';
A ñemintuyo kaknu 'furnished with pearls'.
As the last example illustrates, not only finite verb forms but also non-finite verb forms and adjectives may be accompanied by instances of the instrumental case.

Moreover, while the English preposition by may denote the agent of an action, as in 'I was struck in the head by my mother-in-law,' Tocharian A makes a sharp distinction between sentient and non-sentient agents. Consider the following example: mā poryo tskāṃsaṃtär mā wäryo sikaṃtär mā lāñcsā pärtsi yāteñc mā penu lyäksā kärnātsi yāteñc 'by fire they will not be burned, by water they will not be washed away, by kings they will not be able to be snatched up, nor by thieves will they be able to be stolen.' In italics we see that Tocharian A marks non-sentient agents, true instruments, with the instrumental case; however it employs the perlative case (in boldface) to mark sentient agents, not the instrumental case. In passive sentences, Tocharian generally expresses the agent with the genitive.

The instrumental commonly occurs in a number of senses related to those discussed above. The following list provides some examples.

Expression of Emotion: Tocharian A employs the instrumental to denote expressions of emotion, both literal and figurative. For example: A tsopatsäṃ kāckeyo 'with great joy'; A ākärnunt aśänyo 'with teary eyes'.
Manner: The instrumental may denote the manner in which an action occurs: A tämne-wkänyo 'in such a way'; A tämyo 'thereby, therefore'. We find a related use with numbers: A käntantuyo wältsantuyo tmānantuyo korisyo 'by the hundreds, thousands, ten-thousands (and) ten-millions'.
Progression in Space or Time: The instrumental may denote the extent of space or time through which an action unfolds. For example: A ṣpät-wälts we-känt ṣäptuk ṣäkpi kursärwāyo '7276 miles wide'; A päñcäṃ konyo 'over the course of fifteen days'.
Cause: The instrumental in Tocharian A may overlap in sense with the causal case found in Tocharian B. This denotes the reason or source of an action. For example: A ākntsuneyo 'out of stupidity'; A kipyo 'out of shame'; A tuṅkyo 'because of love'.
30.2 Causal
The causal case appears solely in Tocharian B, marked by the suffix -ñ. The use of this case is rare and generally denotes an expression of emotion. For example: B entseño 'out of envy, because of envy' (with the appearance of -o due to metrical considerations); B kawāñ 'out of greed'; B treme(ṃ)ñ 'out of anger' (this noun only occurs in the plural, to which the causal suffix is attached).

We also find in Tocharian B the causal form pel(y)kiñ 'for the sake (of)'. This is used as a postposition, and the noun it governs takes the genitive case.

Lesson 7
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum
Early Buddhism
Basic Tenets
Buddhism proposes a theory of salvation. (Conze 1993) The need for such salvation arises from a sober account of the world in which we find ourselves, in which any accomplishment or personal gain must of necessity be temporary. This idea, coupled with the notion of rebirth --- in which we must start the same process of pointless aspiration and fleeting gain all over again --- leads to a necessarily gloomy perspective on the process of life. A notion of salvation, a way to break out of this despairing cycle, therefore comes as a welcome alternative. The Buddha's teachings outline not only this sober account of reality, but a straightforward process by which to emerge from its confines.

The first link in the chain of salvation is the realization that this world view comes not from any inherent reality, but rather from the human manner of constructing the mental representation of the universe. Reality as perceived consists of a sequence of moments, dʰarmas (a sense unrelated to that of "law"). Beyond that, Buddha's teachings presuppose no more fundamental reality. The dissatisfaction we endure arises from mental constructs, often termed 'cravings' or 'desires'. The Buddha outlines the Four Noble Truths:

the truth of misery;
the truth that misery originates within the individual through the desire for pleasure or being or nonbeing;
the truth that this desire can be eliminated;
the truth that this elimination occurs by following a methodical Way or Path.
The particular way in which cravings arise and lead to dissatisfaction or misery is envisaged as a chain of existence. The Buddha's law of dependent origination asserts that every mode of existence supposes a prior mode of existence. This creates a chain, which the Buddha describes as composed of 12 links:

ignorance;
karmic predispositions;
consciousness;
form and body;
the five sense organs and the mind;
contact;
feeling-response;
craving;
grasping for an object;
action toward life;
birth;
old age and death.
Through this chain we account for the rise of misery.

In order to break the mental shackles which confine us, therefore, Buddhist doctrine proceeds to a discussion of the manner in which we have built up our particular construction or perception of the universe. By understanding this construction, we may then disassemble it piece by piece, thereby attaining freedom from this confining despair. Meditation largely codifies this process of disassembly. The purpose of meditation is threefold (Conze 1993):

to withdraw the sense from the external stimuli which one uses to define oneself;
to shift attention from the sensory world to a subtler realm as a manner of calming the mind;
to attain perception of reality beyond the senses and the pervasive emptiness which remains.
Buddhist doctrine does not subscribe to a necessary notion of self; specifically it distinguishes no enduring soul. There is a self in a pragmatic and moral sense, as the subject of action. But the objects with which people identify themselves (wealth, status, body, etc.) are impermanent, so the self cannot be permanent. Human existence is the composite of the Five Aggregates (Skt. skandʰas):

physical form (Skt. rūpa);
sensation (Skt. vedanā);
conception (Skt. saṃjñā);
mental disposition (Skt. saṃskāras);
consciousness (Skt. vijñāna).
A person is in a state of continual change, with no enduring self. This recognition of the lack of a self which persists leads to a natural question when confronted with the doctrine of saṃsāra 'rebirth': if there is no enduring self, what persists to be reborn? The Buddha draws the analogy with a flame, which at every moment changes form, while still remaining the same flame.

The individual's psychophysical being must evolve in order for escape from saṃsāra to be possible; if not, the individual would remain in continual transitory existence like the flame. To escape the cycle of rebirth, knowledge of its existence is insufficient. One must also pass through a process of purification by attaining karmic merit. The Buddha describes such meritorious action in the Eightfold Way:

right views;
right aspirations;
right speech;
right conduct;
right livelihood;
right effort;
right mindfulness;
right meditational attainment.
Salvation consists in shedding the delusion of the ego and thereby the cycle of rebirth. This extinction is what is meant by the term Skt. nirvāṇa 'dying out' (as of a flame).

Social Structure
In India at the time of the Buddha, religious mendicants commonly wandered the countryside, either espousing their own particular worldview or searching for a teacher (Skt. guru) to provide spiritual guidance. During the rainy season these mendicants generally suspended their wanderings and retired to various retreats near villages. The Buddha followed in general the same practice along with his disciples. But evidently after the Buddha's death, his followers tended to build their own separate huts and gather at the new and full moons to recite the prātimokṣa, affirming their commitment to monastic discipline.

This persistent gathering of the Buddha's followers ultimately provided the nucleus for the saṃgʰa, the 'congregation' of monks in the Buddhist tradition. The congregation contained two basic types of monks:

Wandering monks: certain of the Buddhist monks maintained their wandering ways and continued to venture into the countryside. These wanderings proved important for the further spread of the doctrine to such places as Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.
Sedentary monks: the lay people typically offered monks the necessities of life in the effort to gain merit (good karma). Eventually such donations came to include tracts of land where the monks could maintain a more permanent residence (vihara). From here the monks could in turn tend to the spiritual guidance of the nearby population.
The saṃgʰa laid the groundwork for the systematic preservation and spread of the Buddhist doctrine.

Ultimately however the sponsorship of king Aśoka brought to Buddhism a more universal appeal and sturdy support. Buddhist monasteries increased in size and number, and formed a launching point for missionaries to other regions, as well as centers of learning for spiritual leaders from faraway lands. In fact Aśoka's reign (274--236 BCE) provides the only certain date in the early history of Buddhism. Traditional accounts state that the death of the Buddha occurred 100 years before A'soka, but modern scholarship generally pushes that date even earlier. Whatever the gap of time between Aśoka and the Buddha, Aśoka's promotion of Buddhist doctrine converted what had been to then a religious sect into a full-fledged Indian religion which extended its reach to all corners of the subcontinent and beyond.

The original organization of the saṃgʰa was democratic. The immediate and practical cause for this was the fact that the Buddha himself designated no leader for the group of disciples upon his passing. It was incumbent upon each disciple to follow the path as laid out by the Buddha, and no disciple had particular authority over the rest. Adding to the philosophical impetus for the lack of designating a successor was a general cultural affinity for democratic governing in that particular region.

The lack of a central religious authority contributed to the early division of the religion into a number of sects (generally thought to be eighteen). Typically each sect had its own canon. Most were either unwritten, or the written documents were lost after the general collapse of Buddhism in India around 1200 CE. The canons which do survive generally have done so either through a stroke of luck or through their preservation in a Buddhist tradition outside of the Indian subcontinent. We may attempt to understand earlier forms of the Buddhist canon by comparing the remnants in the various surviving traditions: ff we compare the same text in two different traditions, or languages, where they agree word for word we may be assured that this particular part of the canon derives from an era antedating the division of those two sects. We do not at present, however, have the capacity to arrive at what would have been the original statements of the Buddha himself; we cannot even be sure in what language they would have been uttered.

The standards which the saṃgʰa serves to uphold form the pillar of Buddhist doctrine known as vinaya, literally 'that which leads', but in context 'monastic discipline': this body of knowledge outlines the rules to which the monks must adhere and the punishments for infractions. Buddhist teaching divided into two main classes, dʰarma 'law' and vinaya 'monastic discipline'. The former became the subject of constant efforts of interpretation and re-interpretation, and for this maintains a somewhat shifting character across time and across sects. Vinaya, by contrast, shows little variation over the course of time. The prātimokṣa forms the heart of the vinaya, containing around 250 rules. The prātimokṣa shows far less variation across sects than other principal Buddhist texts. The major categories are as follows. (Conze 1993) First we find the 4 gravest sins leading to expulsion from the monastic order:

sexual intercourse;
theft;
murder;
exaggeration of one's miraculous powers.
There follow 13 offenses leading to suspension:

5 concerning sexual misconduct;
2 concerning the construction of huts;
6 concerning dissensions within the monastic order.
We then encounter 2 sexual offenses "punishable according to the circumstances", followed by 30 offenses which "involve forfeiture" of the right to share in garments of the monastic order and which could have a negative impact on the offender's rebirth:

handling of gold or silver;
involvement in trading activities;
personal appropriation of goods destined for community use.
A list of 90 offenses which lead to an unfavorable rebirth includes

lying;
slandering;
"teach[ing] the scriptures word by word to an unordained person";
telling the laity of offenses committed by monks.
The remaining offenses include destroying vegetation, drinking alcohol, having a chair or bed with legs higher than 8 inches, followed by 4 offenses requiring confession, 13 rules of decorum, and 7 rules for settling disputes.

Rules are to be recited every two weeks, with a pause following each to allow for individual monks to confess infractions. The Skandʰaka provides the foundation for monastic administration, treating admission into the order, the timing of recitations, etc. Issues were discussed before a general assembly of monks. Any solution was read thrice; silence denoted assent, while further discussion prompted further arbitration, either by a special group chosen from among the monks or by elders of another monastery. Over the course of time, however, a monastic hierarchy developed. The abbot headed administrative affairs and had final say in the goings-on of the monastery.

Grammar
31 Demonstrative Pronouns & Adjectives
The Tocharian languages display a wide range of demonstrative pronouns and adjectives. In general, all demonstratives display three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. The neuter gender, however, occurs only with pronominal use. That is, when a demonstrative functions as an adjective, it takes either the masculine or feminine gender in agreement with the noun it modifies. For example, a noun which is historically neuter in PIE --- and hence of alternating gender in Tocharian --- takes a masculine demonstrative adjective in the singular, feminine in the plural. This restriction of the (synchronic) neuter gender solely to pronominal use parallels the use of lo in Spanish.

Generally speaking the neuter forms of the demonstrative begin with t-, while the masculine and feminine forms show the dental sibilant s-; Tocharian shares this distinction with the major branches of Indo-European, e.g. Greek, Indo-Iranian, Italic, but with the notable exception of Anatolian. Outside of the nominative singular, however, the feminine shows a stem beginning with t-; the masculine stem shows c-, perhaps palatalization of a prior *t-.

The morphology of Tocharian demonstratives shows a somewhat agglutinative structure. In particular, in Tocharian A we find the genitive formed by appending -i to the form of the oblique. For example: singular Obl. A cam, Gen. A cami; plural Obl. A cesäm, Gen. A cesmi. This final -i may have its origin in PIE datives such as that found in Skt. tasmai, which may account for the use of the genitive case in a dative sense among pronouns in Tocharian. (See Section 17.4.1, Lesson 4.) We also find the importation of nominal endings, such as Gen. A tmis < *täm-is and B tuntse < *tu-ntse.

The following table displays the paradigms of the anaphoric deictics: A säm, sām, täm B su, sāu, tu 'the; he, she, it'. Tocharian employs these pronouns as adjectives to modify a noun already introduced in the narrative (as English the). When employed as pronouns, they serve the role of the English third person pronouns he, she, it, or in the plural they.

The next table illustrates the paradigms of the proximal deictics: A säs, sās, täṣ B se, sā, te 'this'. The proximal deictics refer to something close by from the point of view of the speaker, as English this. This certainly may refer to physical proximity: given the phrases this book and that book, the deictic this in English points to the object closer to the speaker. The proximal deictic may also refer to something closer in a narrative sense: given an English sequence the former... the latter, the proximal deictic plays the role of English the latter, i.e. it points to something closer or more recent in the speaker's narrative.

Obl.	 	cesäs	 	tosäs	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ceṃ	 	toy	 	 
Note in the above that the Tocharian A proximal deictic displays a morphological palatalization of the final -ṣ. That is, the final sibilant undergoes palatalization everywhere outside of the masculine and feminine nominative singular. For example, masculine singular Nom. säs, but Obl. caṣ; feminine singular Nom. sās, but Obl. tāṣ.

Tocharian B also possesses another proximal deictic: B seṃ, sāṃ, teṃ 'this (one)'. Tocharian B employs this deictic as a pronoun only. The following table illustrates the paradigm.

Proximal	 	B Masc.	 	B Fem.	 	B Neut.

The last table provides the paradigm for the distal deictics: A saṃ, sāṃ, taṃ B samp, somp, tamp 'that'. These deictics complement the proximals, referring now to an object more distant from the speaker, as English that. In a narrative sequence the former... the latter, the distal deictic plays the role of English the former, referring to the more distant or older element of the narrative.

We find two major features in the historical evolution of the pronoun. Firstly, we note the palatalization in the weak cases of the masculine. This likely derives from an effort to distinguish between masculine and neuter forms: e.g. the neuter nominative and accusative singular would be PIE *tó-d > *tæ > A ta- B te. We find the model for such morphological palatalization in adjectival paradigms, e.g. masculine singular nominative B -tstse, but accusative (oblique) B -cce (cf. Section 13.2, Lesson 3). Secondly we note in the feminine accusative the replacement of *tå with *tā. The final vowel is likely adopted from the feminine nominative singular *sā. As regards the motivation of such a switch, we note that this avoids confusion with the neuter plural PIE *té-H₂ > *tå; moreover, this engenders a dichotomy between singular theme vowel ā and plural theme vowel o.

32 Noun Classes I, II, and III
Noun classes I, II, and III all represent nouns with plurals derived from an original PIE neuter plural *-H₂ > *-a > PToch *-ā. Class I collects nouns whose plural reflects a zero- or *u-suffix before the declensional ending, while classes II and III collect *n- and *nt-stem nouns, respectively. Each class contains further subdivisions based on the particular reflexes encountered. The following chart displays the endings characterizing the subdivision.

Class	 	Subclass	 	A Pl.	 	B Pl.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	1	 	-ā	 	-a
 	 	2	 	-u, -wā	 	-wa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
II	 	1	 	-ṃ	 	-na

III	 	1	 	-nt	 	-nta
 	 	2	 	-ntu	 	 
For a discussion of the historical origins of these endings, see Section 27.1 in Lesson 6. In addition to historical neuter (Tocharian alternating gender) nouns, these classes also contain a number of feminine nouns. The nouns A pukäl (pukul) B pikul fem. 'year', A waṣt B ost alt. 'house' illustrate the declension of class I.

33 Gerundive
The Tocharian gerundive plays a role similar to the formation of the same name in Latin and Greek. The gerundive denotes an adjective formed productively from a verbal stem. For example, in Latin the verb dēlēre 'destroy, wipe out' provides the stem for the gerundive found in Cato's famous refrain Cartʰāgo dēlenda est --- literally 'Carthage is to-be-destroyed', but in sense 'Carthage must be destroyed'. That is, the Latin gerundive is a verbal adjective conveying a sense of necessity; similarly with the Greek gerundives in -téos: e.g., lutéos estí 'he is to-be-loosed,' 'he must be loosed.'

The Tocharian construction derives ultimately from an *l-participle such as that found in past tense formations in Russian. The following chart illustrates the declension.

Gerundive	 	A Masc.	 	A Fem.	 	 	 	 	 	B Masc.	 	B Fem.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-l	 	-lyi	 	 	 	 	 	-lye, -lle	 	-lya
G	 	-lyāp	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-lyepi	 	 
Obl.	 	-läṃ	 	-lyāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-lye, -lle	 	-lyai
V	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-lyu (subst. -lya)	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-lye	 	-laṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-lyi	 	-llona, -lyana
G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	-lyes	 	-laṃ	 	 	 	 	 	-lyeṃ	 	-llona, -lyana
The new twist which Tocharian adds to the gerundive concerns the verbal stem. In particular, whereas in Greek and Latin the gerundive suffix (Gk. -téos, Lat. -ndus) attaches exclusively to the present stem of the verb, the Tocharian gerundive may be formed to either the present or subjunctive stem. The difference in stem betrays a difference in sense between the two gerundive formations. Tocharian may employ either type of gerundive in either attributive or predicate constructions, and likewise as substantive.

Present Stem, the so-called Gerundive I: denotes necessity in positive sentences and prohibition in negative sentences, akin to the Latin and Greek gerundives. Consider the following examples. Attributive: A yaläṃ wramm ats skam yāmiṣ mā yaläṃ wram mar yāmiṣ 'One should always do the thing to be done, one should not do the thing not to be done', from A yām- 'do', present stem ya-; B kärsanälyeṃ wäntarwane 'in things which one must know', from B kärs- 'know', present stem kärsana-. Predicate: A mänt yäl ñi 'how is it to be done by me?', from A yām- 'do', present stem ya-; B kuse wesäñ tanneṃ yamaṣälle 'what is thereby to be done by us?', from B yām- 'do', present stem yāmäsk-. Substantive: A ākälṣäl B akalṣälle 'student', literally '(the one) to be taught', from AB ākl- 'learn, (caus.) teach'; B prekṣallene wayāre-ne 'they led him to the questioning', from B prek- 'ask', present stem prekṣ-.
Subjunctive Stem, the so-called Gerundive II: denotes possibility. Consider the following examples. Attributive: A mākis käkālyāṃ kuleyac 'to a woman accessible to many', literally 'to a woman able-to-be-gone-to for many', from A i- 'go,' subjunctive stem kälk-; B ma wär tärkalye ikene 'in a place impermeable to water', literally 'in a place unable to be passed through by water', from B tärk- 'release', subjunctive stem tärk-. Predicate: A wsālu yetweyntu waṣlaṃ ṣeñc-äm 'robes and jewelry are able to be worn by them', from AB wäs- 'clothe', subjunctive stem waṣ-; B säk śle läkle akālk postäṃ ... mā källalle 'luck, as with suffering, (is) not able to be attained after a wish', from B kälp- 'attain', subjunctive stem källā-. Substantive: A wināsam-ci ynāñm yāmläṃ 'I praise you, worthy treasure', literally 'I praise you, (you thing) able to be worthily made', from AB yām- 'make', subjunctive stem yām-; B mäksu no ṣamāne ... aletsai aśiyaimeṃ ṣañ ṣarsa trāskalye tsāltalye eñcīträ 'whichever monk takes from a nun with his own hand hard (and) soft (food)...', literally '... takes (the thing) able to be chewed (and) able to be chewed...', from B tresk- 'chew' and B tsālt- 'chew', subjunctive stems trāskā- and tsāltā- respectively.
Note the use of the genitive to denote the agent of actions described by gerundives, e.g. A mänt yäl ñi 'how is it to be done by me?' and B kuse wesäñ tanneṃ yamaṣälle 'what is thereby to be done by us?' As the Tocharian genitive forms of the pronoun likely derive from an original PIE dative, this usage apparently parallels that encountered in Greek and Latin: e.g. Gk. Ōpʰelētéa soi hē pólis estí (Lat. Urbs tibi adiuvanda est) 'You must serve the city.'

Tocharian further extends the gerundive to a verbal abstract, often simply termed the abstract, by means of the suffix A -une B -(äñ)ñe. Tocharian attaches the suffix to both the gerundives I and II, leading to abstracts I and II, but with little distinction in meaning. For example, A kälpnālnyac (for kälpnāluneyac, allative) (I) vs. kälpālune (II), both 'attainment', from AB kälp- 'attain'; B tsrelñe (I) vs. tsrālñe (II), both 'separation', from B tsär- 'be apart'.

Because of their derivation from verbs, verbal abstracts can take substantives as complements. If the underlying verb is intransitive, this complement always appears in the genitive case: B śak wäntarwaṃts spärkālñe 'the disappearing of ten things'. If the underlying verb is transitive, the complement may appear either in the oblique case or in the genitive case: A tsärk-rape yāmluneyo (obl.) 'the making (of) lute-music'; A tsopatsäṃ wsokoneyis yneś yāmluneyā (gen.) 'through the open making of great joy.'

34 Preterite
The preterite in Tocharian is a simple past tense. It denotes past completed action, with generally perfective verbal aspect. That is, the action is viewed as a completed whole, with no reference to any internal time structure. In this sense, compare English walked (perfective, no internal time structure) to was walking (imperfective, with the possibility of further subdividing the internal time structure). All classes of preterite formation employ the same non-past endings. Only stem formation distinguishes the classes.

34.1 Preterite Class I
Class I exhibits the archetypical Tocharian preterite formation. The Indo-European origin of this class lies with verbs containing a root-final laryngeal. As these formed root aorists in PIE, the laryngeal came to stand at the end of the stem, and by regular sound change PIE *H > PToch *ā, thus leaving a stem ending in -ā. In PIE terms, those verbs which formed root aorists were typically those whose bare root was non-durative (or perfective, depending on terminology). This required additional marking to derive a durative stem, such as what would be needed to form a present. A common PIE derivational technique infixes an *-n-, i.e. inserts an *-n- before the final consonant of the root. This leads in Tocharian to a common correspondence between Class I preterites and CLASS VI presents, the latter stemming from nasal infixing of verbs with root-final laryngeals in PIE.

Take as an example the PIE root *kʷreiH₂- 'buy'. If we form a root aorist from the zero grade, the third person singular mediopassive gives PIE *kʷriH₂-to > Gk. priato, the attested Homeric aorist. In Tocharian, this would yield PIE *kʷriH₂-to > PToch *käryā-tæ > B *käryāte, the expected form given the attested first person plural B käryāmte. The corresponding present tense form B kärnāstär belongs to the present CLASS X, showing the expected nasal infix, cf. Skt. krīṇīte and OIr. crenaid, followed by the *-sḱ- suffix: *kʷri-n-H₂-sḱe/o- > PToch *kärnā-sk-.

The Tocharian forms also exhibit consonantal alternation due to an original pattern of ablaut. Specifically, the active singular forms (and only the active singular) derive from original *e-grades, while the remaining forms derive from *Ø-grade. The *e naturally leads to palatalization of the preceding consonant. For example, third person singular active A śärs B śarsa < PToch *śärsa < *kers-a-t, but mediopassive A kärsāt < PToch *kärsā- < *kṛs-a-.

In Tocharian A some verbs display yet a different pattern of ablaut. In particular, they show *o-grade in the active plural, and *Ø-grade elsewhere. For example the root A kälk- (part of the suppletive paradigm of AB i- 'go') exhibits the following pattern.

 	 	Preterite	 	 	 	 	 	Subjunctive	 	 	 	 
Active	 	A	 	PToch	 	PIE	 	A	 	PToch	 	PIE
3 Sg.	 	kälk	 	*-Ø-	 	*-Ø-	 	kalkas	 	*-æ-	 	*-o-
3 Pl.	 	kalkar	 	*-æ-	 	*-o-	 	kälkeñc	 	*-Ø-	 	*-Ø-
As illustrated in the chart above, the ablaut pattern of the preterite reverses that found in the subjunctive CLASS v.

The paradigm of PIE *keH₂u-dʰe /o- > PToch *kāut- > A kot- B kaut- 'split off, break', cf. Lat. cūdō 'beat, pound', illustrates the conjugation of Class I preterites.

Pret. I	 	A	 	B	 	PToch	 	PIE

3	 	kotant	 	kautānte	 	*kautā-ntæ	 	*-nto
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Ppl.	 	kākotu	 	kakautau	 	 	 	 
Note in the paradigm for Tocharian B that the stress remains on the stem-terminal -ā-; were that not the case, the vowel would have weakened to a simple -a-.

As the above illustrates, this particular formation spread beyond those roots with original root-final laryngeal. In the Proto-Tocharian period, stem-final PToch *-ā has come to be regarded as a preterite marker by itself, and so is applied to verbs which would otherwise not employ the marker based on historical phonological grounds.

34.2 Preterite Class II
The marking of Class II preterites differs between Tocharian A and B. Each however employs a type of marking familiar from the classical languages Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. Class II is generally restricted to the preterite of causative verbs, whose present stem carries the causative marker A -s- B -sk-, and which had an original short root vowel, hence a Tocharian root vowel ä, i, or u.

Tocharian A forms Class II preterites by means of reduplication. This evidently harkens back to reduplicated aorists of the type found in Sanskrit ajījanat, from the causative janayati 'bring into being'. In general reduplication in Indo-European is a process by which the initial consonant (cluster) of a root is copied and tacked on to the beginning of the root. A vowel is placed between the copied consonant(s) and the original root-initial consonant(s); this vowel may be either the same as the root vowel, or a fixed vowel which does not change with differing root vowels. For example the root PIE *deH₃ 'give' shows in Greek both present reduplication, didōmi, as well as perfect reduplication, dedōka (all Greek verbs with present reduplication employ the vowel -i- in the reduplicated syllable, those with perfect reduplication invariably employ -e-). Latin perfects, when reduplicated, occasionally display vowel harmony: present spondeō 'I vow', perfect spospondī. Sanskrit shows, in addition to those just mentioned, a type of reduplication (the so-called intensive) in which the entire root, including final consonant(s), is reduplicated: kram- 'to stride', intensive caṃkramīti, caṃkramyate. Such wholesale copying of the root rarely occurs in the Indo-European family outside of Sanskrit.

The reduplication found in Tocharian A poses some interesting challenges for historical linguists. In particular, comparison of the reduplicated preterite A śaśärs of the root AB kärs- 'know' (causative: 'make know') to the reduplicated preterite participle B śeśśarsu suggests that the reduplicated syllable employed the vowel PIE *o > PToch *æ. Though *o-grade is the expected ablaut grade in PIE perfects, as in Gk. leloipa from the root lip-, reduplication of the *o-vocalism is rare in Indo-European (the example of Lat. spospondī by no means displays a prevalent or even common vocalism in Latin reduplication). This form moreover suggests that the palatalization of the reduplicated consonant(s) is a secondary process, since there was no front vowel to trigger palatalization on purely phonetic grounds. Compare A käl- 'endure', with preterite kakäl.

Tocharian B forms Class II preterites by means of palatalization and lengthened grade of the root vowel. This lengthened grade possibly derives from contraction of the reduplicated syllable with the root syllable, and so this would imply that the two Tocharian languages ultimately employ the same reduplicated preterite formation. Such reduplication and subsequent contraction (in one of the daughter languages) parallels evidence from Germanic: the preterites Goth. haihait vs. OE hēt, if the latter is in fact the result of contraction. Such examples however are few in Germanic, and the strong tendency toward word-initial accent likely played a crucial role in such developments in Germanic. Tocharian lacks similar stress patterns.

A more likely scenario is that Tocharian B Class II preterites derive from an original PIE perfect formation in long-*ē, of the type found in Lat. lēgī (from legō 'I read') and sēdī (from sedeō 'I sit'). This has the added benefit of providing a direct source of palatalization: *kērs-a- > PToch *śærs-ā- > *śārsā-, the last step following from a-umlaut in Proto-Tocharian. This provides a contrast in the instance of the root B kärs- between the third person singular base (Grundverb) preterite PIE *kers-t > B śarsa (from Class I) and the corresponding causative PIE *kērs- > B śārsa; the sole distinction resides in the root vowel. Note that, in contrast to Class I, in Class II this long-*ē-grade is found throughout the paradigm, not only in singular active forms.

Below the partial paradigm of A käl- 'endure' and the full paradigm of B mäsk- (caus.) 'exchange' illustrate the preterite Class II conjugation.

Pret. II	 	A	 	B

2	 	kaklāṣt	 	myāskasta

2	 	 	 	myāskat
3	 	*kaklānt	 	myāskante
 	 	 	 	 
Ppl.	 	 	 	memisku
Note in the Tocharian B paradigm that stress falls on the root syllable; the lack of stress on the stem-final *-ā- causes its reduction to -a-. Contrast this with the stem-final stress in Class I.

34.3 Preterite Class III
In preterite Class III a long-time friend to students of Greek and Sanskrit makes its appearance: the sigmatic aorist (so named because the marker is PIE *-s-, in Greek the letter sigma). But as with everything in Tocharian, the story is not so simple. This preterite is indeed sigmatic, but only partially so: in the active, the *-s- appears only in the third person singular; however the *-s- occurs throughout all of the mediopassive forms. This holds equally true for both languages. The forms of A prak- B prek- 'ask' (cf. Skt. pṛccʰati) illustrate the paradigm.

Pret. III	 	A	 	B
Active	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	prakwā	 	prekwa
2	 	prakäṣt	 	prekasta
3	 	prakäs	 	preksa
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	prakmäs	 	prekam
2	 	*prakäs	 	*prekas
3	 	prakär	 	prekar
 	 	 	 	 
Mediopassive	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	präkse	 	parksamai
2	 	präksāte	 	parksatai
3	 	präksāt	 	parksate
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	präksāmät	 	parksamt(t)e
2	 	präksāc	 	parksat
3	 	präksānt	 	parksante
 	 	 	 	 
Ppl.	 	papräku	 	pepärku
The alternation in the root vowel, A a B e, of the active forms points back to PToch *æ. This in turn points back to either PIE *ē or *o. The former however invariably leads to palatalization of the preceding consonant whenever possible. This palatalization is in fact observed in Tocharian A in those roots which employ *-s-, supporting the association of these forms with an original aorist formation. The mediopassive forms derive from zero or *e-grade vocalism.

Nevertheless we find a small group of verbs which follow the above pattern of *ē-grade ablaut and third person singular *-s-, but which lack the *-s- and suggest *o-vocalism (i.e. there is no palatalization) in the mediopassive. For example, consider the following forms.

Pret. III	 	A	 	PIE
Active	 	 	 	 
3 Sg.	 	ñakäs	 	*nēḱ-s-t
3 Pl.	 	ñakär	 	*nēḱ-ṛ
 	 	 	 	 
Mediopassive	 	 	 	 
3 Sg.	 	nakät	 	*noḱ-to
3 Pl.	 	nakänt	 	*noḱ-ṇto
The *o-vocalism and lack of *-s- suggest the PIE perfect. The preterite Class III therefore contains the remnants of both the PIE aorist and the PIE perfect. This is similar to the situation found in the Latin perfect: compare Latin perfect dīxī (from dicō 'I say') with Gk. aorist édeiksa 'I showed'; but Latin perfect didicī, the reduplicated perfect of present discō < *di-dḱ-sḱ- 'learn' (an original reduplicated present).

Class III preterites are generally associated with presents of CLASSES VIII, IX, and X, and occasionally of CLASSES I and II. CLASS i subjunctives frequently form Class III preterites.

34.4 Preterite Class IV
Class IV preterites show the stem suffix AB -ṣṣ-, augmented by the Class I marker -ā-, by this time felt to be a general preterite marker: AB -ṣṣā-. Class IV preterites include few base verbs, the majority of the formations being built to causatives. Tocharian A contains few examples of preterites of this class: A lalākṣāwā, from A läk 'see', causative 'show'. The verbs A win-ās- 'revere' B yām- 'do, make' illustrate the paradigm.

34.5 Preterite Class V
Class V preterites exhibit the stem suffix AB -ñ(ñ)-. Few verbs belong to this class. To this suffix is appended the general preterite marker AB -ā-. The primary example is the root AB we- 'say' (which, in Tocharian A, has a suppletive paradigm, the present tense being supplied by tränk-). The paradigm is as follows.

Pret. V	 	A	 	B

There are few documented mediopassive forms. The form supplied above belongs to the root B kwip- 'be ashamed'. In Tocharian A, when CLASS XII presents form Class V preterites, the imperfect and preterite formations fall together.

34.6 Preterite Class VI
Preterite Class VI comprises the so-called thematic preterites, i.e. those with the thematic vowel *e/o > *yä/æ. In fact, only two roots pertain to this class: AB lä-n-t- 'leave' and B käm- 'come'. Their forms are as follows.

Pret. VI	 	A	 	B	 	PIE

1 Sg.	 	lcā	 	latau	 	 
2	 	 	 	lat

3	 	 	 	kameṃ	 	*gʷm-ont
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
PPl.	 	kakmu	 	kek(a)mu	 	 
Note that in Tocharian A the stem naturally arrived at in the third person singular, PIE *H₁ludʰ-e-t > PToch *läc(ä) > A läc-, was then generalized throughout the paradigm and the usual preterite endings employed: first person singular lcā, third plural lcär.

Tocharian B, by contrast, shows the use of non-past endings, e.g. B -u, -ṃ. Moreover the form śem(o), with the 'moveable-o', appears to derive from an original long *ē-grade, in contrast to the zero-grade of other forms.

35 Perlative & Locative
35.1 Perlative
The Tocharian perlative case, marked by A -ā B -sa, expresses a similar range of meaning to the English prepositions by and through. In its most basic sense, this carries a purely spatial or temporal connotation, as with English "One if by land..." or "wading through water". However the Tocharian languages extend this to mark personal agents and even manner of action, as with English "the homework was assigned by the teacher" and "through guile he escaped notice", respectively. The following list distinguishes some of the major uses of the Tocharian perlative.

True Perlative: The basic sense of the perlative denotes motion through a (planar) expanse, and by extension time. Consider the following examples: A tkanā epreraṃ B keṃtsa eprerne 'on land and in the in the sky' (more literally 'over' or 'through land'); A päñ kursärwā ārṣlāsyo rarkusāṃ tkanā kälk 'for five miles he passed through a land strew with snakes'; B swese kentsa swāsäṣṣasta 'you have let rain a rain over the earth'; A propmahur lapā tā- B prāpmahur āṣtsa tā- 'set the diadem on the head'; A śtwar mañsā B śtwer meñtsa 'for four months' (literally 'through four months'); B māka lyakursa 'four times'.
Locative Use of the Perlative: The perlative may denote simply the place on, at, or in which something occurs; this extends likewise to time. Consider the following examples: A ñemiṣiṃ praṅkā yeṣ 'he went on the jewel-island' (literally 'through, upon the jewel-island'); A yaṃtrācāres waṣtā lokit yeṣ 'he went as a guest into the mechanic's house'; A tkanā klā B keṃtsa klāya 'fell on the ground'; A tsarā ents- B ṣarsa eṅk- 'take by the hand'; A taṃne-praṣta 'at such time'; A praṣt praṣtā 'from time to time'.
Instrumental Use of the Perlative: Tocharian may employ the perlative to denote the inanimate instrument by which an action is performed. Tocharian A generally employs the Instrumental case in this role, though one occasionally finds the perlative: A Ārśi-käntwā ritwäṣṣi 'to write in the Ārśi-tongue'. The majority of the examples come from Tocharian B: B antapi kenīnesa keṃ teksa 'he touched the ground with both knees'; B ṣañ ṣarsa 'with (one's) own hand'.
Agent: Tocharian A employs the perlative for rational agents, the instrumental for any other type of agent (inanimate objects): A mā poryo tskāṃsaṃtär mā wäryo sikaṃtär mā lāñcsā pärtsi yāteñc mā penu lyäksā kärnātsi yāteñc 'by fire they will not be burned, by water they will not be washed away, by kings they will not be able to be snatched up, nor by thieves will they be able to be stolen.' Italics denote the instrumental case, boldface marks the perlative case (cf. Section 30.1, Lesson 6). Tocharian B, lacking an instrumental case, employs the perlative in either situation. Consider the following examples: B yessa-k yāṃṣälle 'to be done by you'; B ceu ṣamānentsa ṣamānents āksaṣälle 'by such a monk is it to be announced to the monks'
Manner: Tocharian employs the perlative to describe the way or manner in which an action occurs. Consider the following examples: A tämne-wäknā B te-yäknesa 'in this way'; A mänt-wäknā B mäkte-yäknesa 'in what way?'. In Tocharian B this extends to numeral expressions: B käntenma yältsenma tmanenmasa 'by the hundreds, thousands, (and) ten-thousands'; Tocharian A by contrast employs the instrumental for such expressions (cf. Section 30.1, Lesson 6).
Tocharian B also employs the perlative in several situations where Tocharian A prefers the use of a different case. The following lists some of the differences in usage between the languages.

With Participles and Adjectives: Tocharian B commonly employs the perlative in complements to participles and adjectives. For participles, consider B po krentaunasa kekenu 'provided with all the virtues'; in such instances Tocharian A typically employs the instrumental. For adjectives, consider B kektsentsa skwassu... mā palskosa 'fortunate in body... not in spirit'; here Tocharian A prefers the instrumental. Consider also B meṅkitse eśnesa 'lacking eyes'; here Tocharian A prefers the ablative.
Expressions of Fear: Tocharian B often employs the perlative with the verb B pärsk- 'be afraid, fear' to denote the source of the fear: B pärskau śaultsa 'afraid for (one's) life'. Tocharian B also employs in this role the ablative of the thing feared, or the genitive of the person.
Expressions of Emotion: Tocharian B often employs the perlative with expressions of emotion: B mīwi ceu saksa 'shook on account of happiness'; B katkauñaisa kalñi śaiṣṣe 'the world resounded with joy'. Tocharian B also employs the causal in such expressions (cf. Section 30.2, Lesson 6); Tocharian A generally employs the instrumental (Section 30.1).
Expressions of Price: Tocharian B employs the perlative to denote the price of an item: B ṣalywe käryāmte śwer ṣaṅk ok tom ysāresa 'we bought oil: four pounds for eighty pounds (of) grain'.
Standard of Comparison: Tocharian B frequently uses the perlative to mark the standard against which something is compared. Consider the following examples: B Sumersa tapre 'higher than Sumeru'; B kauṃ meñäntsa lakutsa 'brighter than Sun (and) Moon'; B cisa lāre 'dearer than you'. Tocharian A regularly, and Tocharian B occasionally, employ the ablative case to mark the point of reference in comparisons.
35.2 Locative
The Tocharian locative case, marked by the suffix A -aṃ B -ne, corresponds roughly to the meaning denoted by the English prepositions in, on, or at. The locative denotes, aptly enough, the location or position at which some action occurs: e.g. "Sitting on the dock of the bay...", "That'll happen in your dreams", "Let's meet at my house." This naturally extends to temporal considerations as well: "I'll come on the morrow...", "Make sure you get it to me on time", "The package should arrive at noon." We list below some of the major uses of the locative in Tocharian.

Of Place Where: The locative case responds to the question "where? at what place?" Consider the following examples: A yokmaṃ klyantär 'they are standing at the gate'; A lakeyaṃ orto ṣmäṣ 'He sits right upon the bed'; B tarnene stmau 'standing on the apex'; B olyine ṣamäṃ 'sits in a boat'. The locative may sometimes straddle the border between marking the destination of motion (hence like English into) or the area in which motion takes place (like English through): e.g. A epreraṃ yäṣ 'goes in the air', with the sense either of 'goes into the air' or 'goes through the air'; B yai kauc iprerne 'he went high in(to) the air'.
Of Place to Where: The locative case may answer the question "to where? to what place?" Consider the following examples: A wärtaṃ yäṣ 'went into the woods'; B wartone lac 'went out into the woods'; A ksaluneyaṃ ytsi 'to enter into death'; B kselñene ynūca 'entering into death'; B rine śem 'came into the city'; B nauntaine klāya 'she fell on the street'.
Of Metaphysical Motion: The above senses of the locative denoting location or destination need not refer solely to physical motion. Tocharian employs the same constructions when the motion is metaphysical. Consider the following examples: A Bʰādrānaṃ tuṅk kāpñune 'love (and) affection for Bʰadrā'; B pātär mātärne täṅwassu 'fond of father (and) mother', or more literally 'lovingly disposed towards father (and) mother'; B śwātsi yokstine ymassu 'mindful of eating (and) drinking', or more literally 'thinking on eating (and) drinking' or 'looking towards eating (and) drinking'.
Of Time: The above senses extend by analogy to location or destination in time. Consider the following examples: A tām praṣtaṃ B ceu prekene 'at the time'; A ṣpät koṃsaṃ 'in seven days'; A wikiṣpätiñcinäs ṣpät koṃsaṃ 'in the twenty-seventh week'; B ṣkas meñantse ne 'on the seventh (day) of the month'; A wū kṣaṃsaṃ 'in two blinks of an eye'; B ṣeme kṣanne 'in the blink of an eye'.
Superlative Constructions: Tocharian generally employs the locative in superlative constructions to denote the group among which the entity in question particularly stands out. Consider the following examples: A pūk pñintwaṃ tpär 'highest among all virtues'; A pukaṃ pruccamo 'best of all', literally 'excellent among all'; B ñakteṃ śāmnane śpālmeṃ 'best among gods (and) men'.

Early Divisions within Buddhism
The Buddhist path strives for detachment from the world that surrounds us. At the same time, however, those who continue to follow the path live in the world: they require shelter and sustenance. For this they rely on others, on the laity, and therein lies a fundamental tension. In their efforts to remove themselves from attachment to the world, the Buddhist monks remain dependent on the world and on the people in it. This unfortunate state of affairs has played a role in many schisms within the Buddhist tradition. Though many of the distinctions that arose through the history of Buddhist thought take the form of philosophical disagreement on fine points of interpretation of the canon, at a very basic level the necessity to iron out and take a stance on one side or the other of these philosophical discussions can be traced back to a simple problem of economics.

In particular, division arose within the monastic community concerning the purpose of the monastic order itself. (Conze 1993) The dependence on the laity for the continuation of the order predisposed some of the monks to imagine themselves as working for the spiritual betterment of the laity. This stood in contradistinction to the traditional interpretation of the elders: the purpose of the saṅgʰa was to support the rise of certain Arhats distinguished by their strict devotion to the precepts of monastic discipline and the teachings of the Buddha. Though this conservative trend has remained ever present through the history of Buddhism, the various ensuing schisms often rejuvenated the monastic community's spiritual attention to the laity. This has perhaps culminated in the Mahāyāna concept of the Bodhisattva as a saint who defers nirvana for a time so that he may tend to the happiness of the laity.

Mahāsaṅgʰikas and Stʰaviravādins
The first major schism within the Buddhist religion occurred between the Mahāsaṅgʰikas (lit. 'great assembly') and the Stʰaviravādins. Tradition has it that the sects parted ways roughly a century after the Buddha's death (perhaps around 340 BC). The earliest accounts of the split suggest that it concerned points of monastic discipline. Later accounts however portray the conflict as centering on the nature of the Buddha himself. The Mahāsaṅgʰikas for their part stressed the eternal qualities of the Buddha, his omniscience, his omnipotence, his complete purity, among a host of others. In short, the Buddha was supramundane, an ideal object of worship and altogether beyond the world which we inhabit. Viewed in this light, the historical Buddha Siddʰārtʰa Gautama was merely an imperfect reflection of the transcendental Buddha, sent to this world for the purpose of teaching the populace.

This distinction of the mundane and supramundane conceptions of the Buddha had a more poignant parallel in the guise of an attack on the status that should be accorded the Arhats, the religious saints. (Conze 1993) In particular the Mahāsaṅgʰikas argued that these saints were far from the reverend beings that the community of monks portrayed them to be: they remained ignorant of many topics, were subject to doubt, and could have seminal emissions during sleep. This last one served as supposed confirmation that they were subject to the influence of demons while sleeping. The religious conservatives, the Stʰaviravādins, countered that they maintained the orthodox views of the Buddha himself.

The Mahāsaṅgʰika school stressed not only the transcendental nature of the Buddha, but of thought itself. This falls in line with a general belief that all worldly things are unreal, and that the emptiness which is the object of the Buddhist path must gain its reality from its transcendence beyond the mundane. Some scholars see in the Mahāsaṅgʰika school the early planting of ideas which came to blossom in the Mahāyāna school. However the chain of influence remains mysterious, and some arguments suggest that the Mahāyāna school may in fact have influenced the Mahāsaṅgʰikas.

Pudgalavādins and Stʰaviravādins
The conservative interpretation of the canon remained in the purview of the Stʰaviravādins. The departure from their ranks of the Mahāsaṅgʰikas however did not eliminate philosophical dissent altogether. The next great schism arrived in the challenge put forth by the Pudgalavādins (Skt. pudgala 'person'), or Personalists, early called the Vatsīputrīyas, later the Sammitīyas. This division took place probably some time around 280 BC. Though the Buddha's doctrines go to great lengths to explain the impermanence of the self, in particular linking its structure to the Five Aggregates or skandʰas, the Pudgalavādins argued that Buddhist scripture did indeed require a more subtle notion of a persisting self. The foundation of the assertion lies in scriptural passages such as "One person, when He is born in the world, is born for the weal of the many. Who is that one person? He is the Tatʰāgata." (Conze 1993)

Though the conservative Stʰaviravādins argued that such passages provided a misleading impression because the vehicle of language inevitably leads to imperfection in encapsulating the message of the Buddha, the Personalists remained undeterred. They asserted the necessity of some sort of concept of self to provide continuity between the lives leading up to Buddhahood. Their concept of self, however, was specifically designed to avoid contradiction with the Five Aggregates. The self, according to the Personalists, constitutes the subject of consciousness. This self is "ineffable" and perceived only by the Buddha. (Conze 1993)

From the point of view of the orthodox Stʰaviravādins, the Personalist doctrine smacked of the philosophy of ātman --- the supreme universal self --- early abandoned by the Buddha's teachings. The Personalists' beliefs nevertheless were long lived and appear to have made their own stamp on the Mahāyāna philosophy.

Sarvāstivādins and Vibʰajyavādins
Some time around 240 BC we see the emergence of another school of thought Sarvāstivāda (lit. 'teaching that everything exists'). The central point at issue was the nature of past, present, and future. In particular the meditation practices of the Buddhist tradition are designed to allow the practitioner to realize the full extent of the fleeting nature of existence by focusing on the initial coming into existence and subsequent fading away of events (dʰarmas). (Conze 1993) Through such meditation the practitioner deepens his understanding of the impermanence of the mundane and thereby strengthens his detachment therefrom.

This focus on the rise, evolution, and disappearance of events had the byproduct of calling into question the nature of past, present, and future: whether only the present really exists. This led inevitably to a philosophical thorn in the side (Conze 1993): if only the present exists, then karmic action is logically unsatisfactory. Karmic action presupposes that past action can affect the present; but if only the present exists, then prior action must already have faded into non-existence and therefore cannot exert any influence on the present.

The Sarvāstivāda doctrine attempts to work around this and other logical conundrums by asserting that everything --- past, present, future --- does in fact maintain an existence. Notably, however, this school did not assert the existence of the self. This line of inquiry ultimately led to a large body of philosophical literature encapsulated in the books of the Abʰidʰarma.

The orthodox view was maintained by the Vibʰajyavādins. Under the support of king Aśoka their beliefs ultimately found their way to Sri Lanka and laid the groundwork for what is known as Theravada Buddhism.

Grammar
36 The Pronominal Adjective 'Other'
Tocharian A ālak B alyek 'other, another' may function either as an adjective or as a pronoun. As the paradigm below illustrates, the root PToch alyæ- is reminiscent of Latin alius 'other' and likely stems from a common ancestor PIE *H₂elyo-, also found in Greek állos 'other' (Pinault 2008). Some suggest, however, that we might find in the Tocharian forms instead the reflex of PIE *H₂olno-, found also in Old Latin olle 'that one', OCS lani 'in the previous summer or year', and Skt. áraṇa- 'distant, strange'. The sequence *-ln- would account for the geminate -ll- of the Tocharian B forms, and the palatalized forms -ly- would arise by conflation with the stem *H₂elyo- (Adams 1999). If we suppose an original *H₂elyo-, either in true origin or by conflation, then the subsequent development proceeds as outlined below:

Case	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	Tocharian
Singular

 	 	 	 	> B *ālyeṃ-kä + -ṃ	 	B alyeṅkäṃ
We notice in the Proto-Tocharian period the addition of a particle *kä. This evidently became so closely allied with the word as to affect the accentual structure: the accent in Tocharian B shifted to the syllable immediately preceding the *-kä, thus shifting the initial *ā to the unaccented a. In Tocharian A, we find depalatalization of the *-ly-, likely to maintain a distinction with the feminine forms which are generally characterized by palatalization in other adjectival formations.

We see in the plural forms in Tocharian B the appearance of a nasal element preceding the -k- of the suffix. As the above table outlines, this finds its origin in the *-ns of the PIE accusative plural. This form, proper to the oblique plural, is occasionally imported into the oblique singular. Moreover in the masculine oblique plural we find a secondary recharacterization by appending the oblique plural ending B -ṃ once again. The same holds true for the Tocharian B genitive plural form alyeṅkäṃts, where the typical ending -ṃts has been appended to the oblique plural form. The same structural principal applies in the singular: B alyek (oblique) forms the basis for the genitive alyek-epi. In Tocharian A the recharacterization is even more thoroughgoing, so that the suffixal *-kä has been completely integrated to the stem and all morphological case markers follow the suffix.

The chart below provides the complete list of forms for A ālak B alyek 'other, another'.

 	 	A Masculine	 	A Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ālak	 	ālyāk	 	 	 	 	 	alyek, allek	 	alyāk
G	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	alyekepi	 	 
Obl.	 	āl(y)akäṃ	 	ālyäkyāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	alyek, alyeṅk, allyek	 	allok
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	ālyek	 	ālkont	 	 	 	 	 	alyaik	 	alloṅk(na)
G	 	ālu	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	alyeṅkäṃts	 	 
Obl.	 	ālykes, ālyekäs	 	ālkont	 	 	 	 	 	alyeṅkäṃ	 	alloṅkna
The form A ālu 'for others' (genitive plural) provides difficulty. Though the logical source would be the PIE genitive plural *H₂elyōm, the ending should yield *-ōm > *-u > A -Ø. One suggestion is that this particular form in fact derives from another adjectival suffix -u (Pinault 2008).

This pronoun appears in slightly altered form as A ālamwäc B ālyewce (ālyauce) in locutions of the form 'the one... the other.' Based on a Latin model, we would expect an expression of the sort alius... alium, involving repetition of the pronoun, though perhaps with differing case endings. Assuming this as the origin, we would find *H₂elyos... H₂elyum > *ālyæ... ālyæ, and so the distinction between the two forms would be lost in both languages. It seems that Tocharian did not favor this situation, and so emphasized the second element by adding *dwi-to- 'second'. Thus we find for the second instance of the pronoun in such turns of phrase *H₂elyo-m dwito- > PToch *ālyæ-wätæ > *ālyæ-wäcæ, yielding A ālamwäc B ālyewce. The difficulty of the proposed evolution, however, lies in the retention of the -m- in the Tocharian A form. This perhaps derives from *H₂elyo-s dwito- > PToch *ālyæzwätæ > *ālyæzβwäcæ, and the sequence *-zβ- was perhaps rendered as -(z)m- in Tocharian A (Pinault 2008).

37 Noun Class IV: r-Stems
Noun class IV comprises original PIE *r-stem nouns denoting kinship, that is, the words for father, mother, daughter, etc. For example, this class includes PIE *pH₂tḗr > PToch *pācær > A pācar B pācer 'father'. Note in particular that the *ē in the final syllable palatalizes the preceding *t; this does not occur in the weak cases such as the accusative: *pH₂tṛ-m > PToch *pātr-ä(n) > B pātär. Whereas Tocharian B preserves the *t in the weak cases, Tocharian A has innovated and extended the palatalized *c of the nominative throughout the remainder of the paradigm. Aside from the sole genitive form B tkātre, nouns of this class generally display the genitive singular -i, likely deriving ultimately from the PIE dative: *-tr-ey > *-träy > -tri.

Tocharian A generally employs -i as the ending of the nominative plural, -äs for the oblique plural; pracar 'brother' however uses endings -e and -es, respectively. Tocharian B, on the other hand, possesses two distinct plural formations. Plural I formations exhibit a nominative and oblique ending -a, identical to nouns of alternating gender; plural II formations show nominative and oblique -ñ, with an accompanying genitive -nts. The latter formation arises in the paradigms for pācer 'father', specifically plural nom./obl. pātärñ, gen. pātärnts(o); tkācer 'daughter', plural nom./obl. tkātärñ, gen. tkātärts; and procer 'brother', plural nom./obl. protärñ, gen. protärñts.

38 Present Participles & Agent Nouns
Tocharian possesses present participles which may be formally divided into active and mediopassive voices. In practice, however, they often overlap in function and meaning. The two languages also present a number of agent noun formations, some of which bear a striking similarity to present participles. Again, the practical use of agent nouns can often overlap with the use of participles, and the distinction between the categories remains very fluid in both Tocharian A and Tocharian B.

38.1 Present Participle Active
Tocharian possesses a present active participle with suffix A -nt B -ñca. This denotes an ongoing action contemporaneous with the principal verb in the clause. For example, the root āk- 'lead' has present active participle A āśant B aśeñca 'leading', as in e.g. 'the man leading the cattle'. We find this construction built to a wide number of present classes, though the construction remains rare among CLASS I present verbs. In Tocharian B specifically, the construction only occurs with present thematic verbs or those whose present stem ends in -ā-. The following chart provides some examples of the present active participle of verbs from various present classes.

Present	 	Type	 	Affix	 	Root	 	Participle	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
II	 	thematic	 	*-e/o	 	A āk-	 	A āśant	 	lead
 	 	 	 	 	 	B āk-	 	B aśeñca	 	lead
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
V	 	athematic	 	*-H-, -eH₂	 	A śuw-	 	A śwānt	 	eat
 	 	 	 	 	 	B śuw-	 	B śawāñca	 	eat
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VI	 	athematic	 	*-n-H	 	A kärs-	 	A kärsnānt	 	know
 	 	 	 	 	 	A wärp-	 	A wärpnānt	 	receive
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VIII	 	thematic	 	*-se/o	 	A e-	 	A eṣant	 	give
 	 	 	 	 	 	A ko-	 	A koṣant	 	kill
 	 	 	 	 	 	B kau-	 	B kauṣeñca	 	kill
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
IX	 	thematic	 	*-sḱe/o	 	B ai-	 	B aiṣṣeñca	 	give
 	 	 	 	 	 	B yām-	 	B yamaṣṣeñca	 	make
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
X	 	thematic	 	*-n(H)-sḱe/o	 	A *täm-näsk-	 	A tmäṃṣant	 	beget
The Tocharian present participle bears a striking similarity to equivalent formations in other ancient Indo-European languages: Lat. ag-ere 'to lead', agens (Gen. agentis) 'leading'; Gk. ág-ein 'to lead', ágōn (Gen. ágontos) 'leading'. Given that the root AB āk- 'lead' Tocharian shows A āśant B aśeñca, we expect the vowel preceding the nasal element of the suffix to be PIE *o > PToch *æ > A a B e. This concurs with the Greek, which usually remains faithful to PIE vowel quality. It will come as little surprise, however, that Tocharian throws in a wrinkle. Consider the following evolution.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Expected	 	Actual
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*H₂eǵ-ont-	 	*āk-ænt-	 	A *ākant	 	A āśant
 	 	 	 	B *aként-a	 	B aśeñca
That is, we would not expect palatalization before the participial suffix *-ont-, but we indeed find in the root above ś rather than k. This is not merely a feature of this root alone, but rather a feature of the Tocharian present active participle formation in general: the final consonant preceding the participial suffix generally undergoes palatalization whenever possible. This does not occur, however, in Tocharian A when the participle is formed to a verb with athematic present. Moreover we find in Tocharian B the palatalized reflex -ñc-, rather than the expected *-nt-, and the addition of a suffixal *-ā. The origin of these peculiarities to date remains unclear.

We illustrate the declension of the present active participle with the root A ko- B kau- (Present CLASS VIII) 'kill'.

 	 	A Masc.	 	A Fem.	 	 	 	 	 	B Masc.	 	B Fem.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	koṣant	 	koṣant	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñca	 	kauṣeñca
G	 	koṣäntāp	 	koṣäntāp	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñcantse	 	kauṣeñcantse
Obl.	 	koṣäntāṃ	 	koṣäntāṃ	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñcai	 	kauṣeñcai
V	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñcai	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	koṣäntāñ	 	koṣäntāñ	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñcañ	 	kauṣeñcana
G	 	koṣäntāśśi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñcaṃts	 	 
Obl.	 	koṣäntās	 	koṣäntās	 	 	 	 	 	kauṣeñcaṃ	 	kauṣeñcana
Note that in Tocharian A masculine and feminine forms are identical. In Tocharian B, the same holds true in the singular; but the plural nominative and oblique of the feminine show a special ending in -na. Note also that the final -ñ of the masculine plural nominative occasionally appears as -ṃ.

38.2 Present Participle Mediopassive
Tocharian likewise exhibits a mediopassive participle with suffix A -māṃ B -mane. This suffix joins to the present stem as determined by the given verb's present class, just as with active participle. This bears a striking similarity to mediopassive participles in other ancient Indo-European languages, and the chart below illustrates the likely evolution.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Tocharian	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-mH₁no-	 	*-mānæ-	 	A -māṃ	 	Gk. -menos
 	 	 	 	B -mane	 	Skt. -māna-
Tocharian however does not make a hard distinction between the active and mediopassive participles. The mediopassive participle appears with a nearly equal distribution between active and passive senses. Though the non-passive use of the mediopassive participle should strictly have middle sense (e.g. reflexive sense, or a sense of having impact back on the subject), in practice Tocharian makes little distinction and the mediopassive participle can take on a truly active sense. In particular, many verbs which predominantly (or exclusively) appear with active finite forms predominantly (or exclusively) exhibit mediopassive present participles; this particularly holds in Tocharian B among athematic presents of CLASSES I, V, VI, VII. On the other hand many verbs with mediopassive finite inflection (particularly CLASS III and IV presents) show an active present participle as their sole active form. Consider the following examples.

Root	 	Meaning	 	Class	 	Active 3sg.	 	MedP 3sg.	 	Act. Ptcple	 	MedP Ptcple
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A nas-	 	be	 	II	 	naṣ	 	 	 	 	 	nasmāṃ
B nes-	 	be	 	I	 	nesäṃ	 	 	 	 	 	nesamane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B yok-	 	drink	 	I	 	yokäṃ	 	 	 	 	 	yokamane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A sälp-	 	burn	 	I	 	sälpäṣ	 	 	 	 	 	sälpmāṃ
B sälp-	 	burn	 	I	 	salpäṃ	 	 	 	 	 	sälpamane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B kärst-	 	break	 	VI	 	karsnaṃ	 	 	 	 	 	kärsnāmane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B pik-	 	write	 	VII	 	piṅkäṃ	 	 	 	 	 	piṅkemane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A trik-	 	go astray	 	III	 	 	 	trikatär	 	trikant	 	trikamāṃ
B trik-	 	go astray	 	III	 	 	 	triketär	 	 	 	trikemane
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A mäsk-	 	find oneself	 	III	 	 	 	mäskatär	 	mäskant	 	mäskamāṃ
B mäsk-	 	find oneself	 	III	 	 	 	mäsketär	 	mäskeñca	 	mäskemane
In contrast to the active present participle, the mediopassive participle generally does not inflect for person, case, and number (not at all in Tocharian A). In this regard the mediopassive participle functions much like the gerund of romance languages (in form and sense) or somewhat like the absolutive in Sanskrit (in form). That is, Tocharian often employs the mediopassive participle to denote an action secondary to the main verb, with the subject of lesser import and understood merely from context, without any formal marking to denote concordance between participle and subject.

38.3 Agent Nouns
Tocharian also possesses a number of different agent noun formations, that is, nouns built to a verbal root which express someone or something that performs the action of the root: e.g. in English doer, painter, runner, etc. A particularly noteworthy agent noun formation is nearly identical to that of the present active participle: A -nt B -nta. Like the gerundive, but unlike the present active participle, this agent noun may derive from either the present or the subjunctive stem; when derived from the present, this leads to complete identity in Tocharian A with the present active participle. The following chart provides some examples.

Root	 	Meaning	 	Pres. Class	 	Subj. Class	 	Agent Noun	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A āk-	 	lead	 	II	 	 	 	āśant	 	coach
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A ko-	 	kill	 	VIII	 	 	 	koṣant	 	executioner
B kau-	 	kill	 	VIII	 	 	 	kauṣenta	 	murderer
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A pärk-	 	ask	 	VIII	 	 	 	prakṣant	 	questioner, judge
B pärk-	 	ask	 	VIII	 	 	 	prekṣenta	 	questioner, judge
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A pik-	 	write	 	 	 	V	 	pekant	 	painter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
A tsip-	 	dance	 	 	 	V	 	tsepant	 	dancer
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B we-	 	speak	 	 	 	VII	 	weñenta	 	orator
The declension of these agent nouns follows the paradigm given above for the present active participle.

In English we find various different suffixes used to derive agent nouns. Beside the suffix -er applied to derive singer from the verb sing, we also find for example the suffix -ist applied to derive lobbyist from the verb lobby. Similarly Tocharian possesses a number of suffixes used to derive agent nouns from verbs. The following list provides a number of the most common suffixes.

B -mo: This suffix occurs as a method of deriving agent nouns only in Tocharian B, where it is added to either the present or the subjunctive stem. A linking vowel appears when the suffix is added, PIE *-e- > PToch *-yä- > B -ä-, and so this causes palatalization in the preceding consonant whenever possible. Take for example B aiśamo 'sage,' agent noun derived from B aik- 'know', a CLASS II present verb, via the intermediate stem *aiśä-. Agent nouns of this type decline according to the pattern given for B klyomo 'noble' in Lesson 4, Section 18.
B -uki: This Tocharian B formation has a generalizing or repetitive connotation. It is employed with CLASS IX presents, with concomitant palatalization. For example: B kälyp- 'steal', agent noun käpaṣṣuki 'thief.' These nouns follow the same basic declension as B klomo, but with -i instead of -o. The verbal nature of these agent nouns is transparent enough that Tocharian often employs them in lieu of participles. They also follow the declension in Lesson 4, Section 18, but with a change of the last B -o to B -i.
B -ca: This Tocharian B suffix, interestingly, attaches to the preterite participle, rather than the present stem. For example, kärsauca 'expert,' built to the preterite participle kärsau of the root kärs- 'know.' These agent nouns may also be employed in lieu of participles. They also follow the declension in Lesson 4, Section 18, but with a change of the last B -o to B -a.
A -ts B -tsa: These forms derive from PToch *-tsā. The primary exemplar in this group of agent nouns is PIE *ṇ-ǵneH₃-tiH₂ > PToch *æn-knā-tsā > *ān-knā-tsā > *àknā́tsà > A āknāts B aknā́tsa (cf. Section 11.4.3 of Lesson 3). This illustrates the likely origin of this formation in the PIE suffix *-tiH₂. These too follow the declension in Lesson 4, Section 18, but with a change in the last B -o to B -a.
A -nts B -ntsa: These forms derive from PToch *-ntsā and are generally applied to the subjunctive stem of verbs. For example: A *wāpants B wapāntsa 'weaver' from the Class v subjunctive of AB wāp- 'weave.' The formal declension does not differ from the preceding.
While the formations B -uki and B -ca maintain enough of the original verbal force that they may play the role of participles, such is not the case for the other formations. For the most part, the remaining formations occur as the second member of compounds.

39 Optative & Imperfect
The Tocharian optative and imperfect share many features in their formation. In particular we find overlap in the suffixes applied to the root, and we likewise find overlap in the endings employed. Tocharian A employs the non-past endings (Lesson 2, Section 9.2) for the optative, as well as for the special imperfects A yem 'I was going' and A sem 'I was'. Tocharian A uses the past endings (Lesson 3, 14.2) in the remainder of the imperfect system. Tocharian B, by contrast, employs the same set of endings for both imperfect and optative, but with modifications: the singular active endings are the unique set 1 sg. -m, 2 sg. -t, 3 sg. -Ø, and the remaining endings come from the non-past paradigm. This results in the following set of endings.

 	 	A Imperfect	 	A Optative	 	 	 	 	 	B Imperfect	 	B Optative
Active

39.1 i-Optative
The Tocharian languages both exhibit an optative formation. Interestingly, the formation does not derive directly from the verbal root, but rather from the subjunctive stem. This is unique among the archaic Indo-European languages. Both Tocharian A and B mark the optative by addition of the suffix AB -i-, which nevertheless shows continuity with the original PIE optative marker *-i(e)H₁-. In Tocharian B this suffix regularly triggers palatalization of root-final -k-, -sk-, -t-, -n-, -s-; in Tocharian A, by contrast, the suffixe palatalizes only root-final -k- or -s-, and these only occasionally.

The verb AB yam- 'do, make' illustrates the formation.

39.2 oy-Optative
Tocharian B exhibits a special oy-optative. In Tocharian B the optative marker -i- combines with a (subjunctive) stem-final -ā- to yield -oy-. In Tocharian A, by contrast, the optative marker -i- substitues for the stem-final -ā-, and so no diphthong results.

The verb AB kärs- 'know' illustrates the corresponding formations in the respective languages.

39.3 Imperfect
The two Tocharian languages exhibit distinct imperfect formations. Both languages largely build the imperfect onto the present stem of the verb. This implies that in principle there are as many imperfect formations as there are present classes. But while Tocharian A characterizes the imperfect by means of a suffix A -ā-, Tocharian B marks the imperfect with suffix B -i-, ultimately imported from the optative.

English provides a ready semantic parallel for the overlap between imperfect (a past indicative) and optative (an irrealis mood) in the guise of the auxiliary would. As the past tense of will, the auxiliary forms the basis of a past indicative in phrases such as (he said) he would go (the following day); at the same time (if) he would go serves as an irrealis formation with would construed as a modal auxiliary.

Tocharian A actually exhibits three separate types of imperfect formation. By far the most common derives the imperfect by appending the suffix -ā- to the present stem; the suffix is perhaps imported from the preterite. The stem-final consonant nevertheless often displays palatalization. The following chart compares present and imperfect forms for verbs from various present classes.

A Imperfect	 	Root	 	Present	 	Imperfect	 	Meaning	 	Notes
Class

XII	 	kāṣ-	 	kāṣiñtsi (inf.)	 	kāṣiññā	 	scold	 	formally equiv. to pret.
The second imperfect formation displayed by Tocharian A involves a small number of verbs which show an imperfect built to the subjunctive stem. In particular we find the root täkw- (meaning uncertain), with causative imperfect täkwāṣā(nt) built to the subjunctive stem; similarly tpuk- 'be hidden' with (perhaps causative) imperfect tpukñānt; and tsāk- 'shine' with (perhaps causative) imperfect tsākñā.

The third and final type of Tocharian A formation builds the imperfect directly onto the root. When the verb employs a suppletive paradigm, the imperfect nevertheless derives from the present stem. When possible, the initial consonant of the root undergoes palatalization. Some verbs exhibit a root-vowel -ā- in the imperfect; others show an s-suffix. Scholars generally term the former the strong imperfect, the latter weak. The following chart compares forms for verbs from various present classes.

A Imperfect	 	Root	 	Present	 	Imperfect	 	Meaning	 	Notes
Class	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	tsip-	 	tsipiñc (3 pl.)	 	śepär (3 pl.)	 	dance

II	 	pär-	 	pärtär (3 sg. mp.)	 	pārat	 	carry	 	cf. 3 sg. pret. kāmat
V	 	läk-	 	lkāṣ	 	lyāk	 	see	 	 
VI	 	kärs-	 	kärsnāṣ	 	śārsar (3 pl.)	 	know	 	 
In Tocharian B verbs forming the present according to CLASSES I--IV and VII--XII form the imperfect by simple addition of the marker -i- to the present stem. When the stem ends in a consonant, this is subject to palatalization. By contrast the imperfect marker -i- combines with a stem-final -ā-, when present, to yield -oy-. The pertains in particular to verbs with CLASS V (-ā-) and VI (-nā-) presents. The following chart provides some examples of the formation of the imperfect in Tocharian B corresponding to various present classes.

3	 	yeñc	 	yeyeṃ (yeṃ)	 	 	 	 	 	ṣeñc	 	ṣeyeṃ (ṣeṃ)
These forms generally represent archaic holdovers from the PIE optative. Consider the following evolution.

Root	 	PIE	 	Early PToch	 	Late PToch	 	A	 	B

*H₁ei-	 	*H₁i-yeH₁-	 	*yäyæ- + -yä-	 	*yæy-	 	ye-	 	yai-
In particular, it appears that the original optative stems with suffix *-yeH₁- were subsequently recharacterized in the Proto-Tocharian period and extended once again with the optative *-ī- > *-yä- to mark the imperfect.

40 Comitative, Allative & Ablative
40.1 Comitative
The comitative case appears in both Tocharian languages and is marked by the suffix A -aśśäl B -mpa. This case expresses the general notion of accompaniment, whether the parties be situated together at the moment, about to come together, or together but on the point of parting ways. The English preposition with, in the context of accompaniment (as opposed to instrument, as in Section 30.1), displays a range of meaning similar to the Tocharian case: 'He's with me;' 'I have a meeting with my boss at 4pm;' 'I just came from a jog with my high school buddy;' etc. We also find Tocharian emphasizing the sense of the comitative case by use of adverbs: A ṣyak B eṣe, ṣe, ṣesa. Consider the following examples:

A Metraknaśśäl ṣyak kunmässi B Maitreyeṃmp=eṣe śamtsi 'come together with Maitreya;'
A klopaśśäl ritwo B laklempa rittowo 'associated with suffering;'
A ākläṣlyesaśśäl ṣyak metär B aklaṣlyeṃmpa ṣesa maitare 'they went together with the students.'
We also find the comitative case employed in situations where equality or sameness is implied. Here English would often prefer as or to: 'That's the same as mine;' 'His portion should be equal to my own.' This typically occurs with the verb A tāsk- B tās- 'equal.' Consider the examples below.

A tmaśśäl tāskmāṃ B tumpa tasemane '(being) equal to this;'
A oṅkälme śuṇḍaśśäl tāskmāṃ '(being) the same as the trunk of an elephant;'
B pudñäktentse tskertkanempa tasetär 'it is equivalent to the fetters of the Buddha.'
40.2 Allative
Both Tocharian languages display an allative case marked by the suffix A -ac B -ś(c). This case denotes the goal or destination of directed motion in its most general sense. This case plays a role similar to the prepositions to or toward in English, as in 'go to(ward) Rome;' or similar to ad in Latin: īre ad Rōmam 'go to(ward) Rome.' The most basic examples therefore pertain to physical motion:

A käṣṣinac kälk B käṣṣiṃś(c) masa 'went to the teacher;'
A Metraknac kumnäṣ B Maitreyeṃś(c) känmaṣṣäṃ 'he comes to Maitreya;'
A kāswac sāspärtwu B kätseś(c) paspārtau 'directed toward Heaven.'
The notion of a destination of motion is naturally extended in Tocharian to the goal of metaphysical motion. Thus the allative occurs likewise with verbs denoting a shift of attention or some other imagined motion. Consider the following examples.

A śominānac lkāmāṃ 'looking at the girl' or 'looking toward the girl;'
B lāntsoś tāu ñäskem 'week seek after the queen,' or simply 'we seek the queen;'
A mar cmolac kāckäc 'do not look forward to birth.'
We also find the allative employed in some other common uses. The most salient of these are presented in the list below.

After Verbs of Speaking: The allative often marks the person addressed or spoken to when accompanying verbs denoting the act of speaking. For example: A lāntac träṅkäṣ B lāntäś weṣṣäṃ 'speaks to the king;' A weña-nn-anac B weñā-neśc 'spoke to him.' One less frequently finds the oblique case employed in such constructions instead of the allative.
Of Purpose or Limit: The destination denoted by the allative may denote the purpose of an action. For example: A moknac niṣpal mā tāṣäl 'one should not leave behind possessions for old age,' but more literally 'possessions ought not remain for the old.' The allative may also denote the limit or extent of an action: A kñukac wraṃ kälk 'he went in the water up to the neck.'
With Infinitival Purpose Clauses: We find the allative employed with the infinitive in clauses denoting purpose, akin to English 'so as to...' in the sense of 'in order to...' or 'with the purpose of... .' This occurs less frequently in Tocharian A than in Tocharian B. Consider the following examples: A kāswoneyantu kropnäsiyac 'so as to store up virtue(s);' B ce wace ślok ñäktets ñakte ākṣ=omte tsārwässiś ceṃ wnolmeṃ 'the god of gods recited there the second strophe so as to comfort these beings.'
40.3 Ablative
The ablative case is marked by the ending -äṣ, and less frequently -aṣ or -āṣ, in Tocharian A and by the ending -meṃ in Tocharian B. Though in Tocharian the ablative is a secondary case and therefore bears no historical relation to the Proto-Indo-European case of the same name in terms of morphology, the Tocharian case nevertheless plays roughly the same syntactic role. In its most basic sense, the ablative denotes the origin of some action; in terms of location it denotes the source or point of issue: e.g. in English 'He arrived from Tokyo,' or 'He set out from home.' More generally it marks an origin when some notion of separation is implied: 'The keel measures 30 feet from stem to stern.' In both Tocharian languages the ablative appears with a large number of verbs in this basic sense. The following list provides a few notable examples to give a sense of the wide range of use:

AB i- 'go': For example: A cmoläṣ cmolac ymāṃ 'going from birth to birth;' A ṣukṣaṣ riṣak kälk 'the ṛṣi went out from the village;' B päst paṣ ñy ostameṃ 'get out of my house!'
AB lä-n-t- 'go out': For example: A Lāṅk riyäṣ läc 'he went out from the city Laṅkā;' A waṣtäṣ lantu B ostmeṃ ltu 'gone out from the house;' B cewaś ostameṃ lnaskem 'we are going from the house to him.'
AB kārp- 'descend, step down': For example: A opläṣ oplā kārnmāṃ 'stepping from lotus to lotus;' B Tuṣitmeṃ kakārpau '(having) decended from Tuṣita-heaven.'
A lit-, let- B lait- 'fall down': For example: ñäktañ ñäkcyās wimāntwäṣ litatsy oki ṣkitāntär 'the gods appear as if to fall from the divine palaces;' B mai ñi tākaṃ laitalñe wrocc-asānmeṃ laṃntuññe 'will there be for me some great falling from the great kingly throne?'
AB wik- 'disappear': For example: A pontsāṃ kapśiññäṣ omlyi wikṣā pekäntāp 'She cast out the heat from the entire body of the painter,' employing the causative of the root wik-; B okt bʰūmintameṃ yaikoṣ kleśanma 'having driven away the afflictions from the eight states,' employing the causative preterite participle of the root wik-.
AB tsär- 'separate': For example: A kāpñeyäṣ tsro 'separated from the beloved;' B lareṃnmeṃ tsrelñe 'separation from loved ones.'
The origin or separation may be metaphysical in nature. The ablative may be used in conjunction with a wide range of expressions referring to emotions. Consider the following examples.

Source of Emotions: We find the ablative denoting the source of emotions. Consider the following examples: A puk āñmaṣ käryāṣ tāṣ plāc ṣakk ats päklyoṣäs 'from the entire soul (and) out of (good) will hear ye now these counsels;' B po araṃśmeṃ mantsanatär 'he laments from his whole heart.'
Expressions of Fear: We find the ablative used in conjunction with expressions of fear with the verb AB pärsk- 'be afraid of.' For example: A lāntuneyäṣ pärsko 'frightened of the royal majesty.' Tocharian A generally employs a genitive of the person feared. Similarly: B mā tañ yolyai imaimeṃ prosko nesäṃ 'you have no fear of the evil way.' Tocharian B rarely employs the ablative with expressions of fear with the verb pärsk-; instead we generally find the perlative. We also find the ablative with expressions of trepidation or caution as with the verb A pās- B pāsk- 'beware of.' For example: A omäskenäṣ mā pāṣtär '(if) he is not wary of the wicked;' B toṃmeṃ pāṣṣat 'be ye wary of them.'
Expressions of Lack: We find in Tocharian A the ablative employed to denote absence or lack of something. For example: A tsarnäṣ pesäṣ wärcetse 'lacking hands (and) feet', or 'bereft of hands (and) feet.' Tocharian B, by contrast, generally employs the perlative in such constructions.
We also find the ablative employed in two additional important roles:

Standard of Comparison: In comparative constructions, such as English faster than a speeding bullet, Tocharian uses the ablative case to mark the standard of comparison or point of reference for the comparison (than a speeding bullet in our example). For example: A Vipul ṣuläṣ lyutār tpär 'higher than Vipula mountain;' A klyominās wramnäṣ klyom 'noble(r) than the noble(st) thing.' Tocharian B employs the ablative of comparison in more restricted settings, generally preferring the perlative to mark the standard of comparison. In Tocharian B the ablative occurs in some figurae etymologicae, such as B amāskaimeṃ amāskai 'stronger than strong,' i.e. 'the absolute strongest.' We also find the ablative with B oṃṣap and olyapo 'more': B tumeṃ oṃṣap 'more than that.' Similarly, Tocharian B uses the ablative with B meṅki, a noun meaning 'lack,' to convey the sense 'less than.' For example: B wi lakṣānäñc pañäktemeṃ Nandentse meṅki ṣai 'Nanda had two Lakṣaṇas (characteristics) less than the Buddha,' or more literally 'To Nanda there was a lack of two Lakṣaṇas with respect to the Buddha.' Both Tocharian languages regularly employ the ablative in constructions with 'other': A ālyek cwäṣ 'other than you;' B temeṃ allek 'other than this.' The perlative may also serve in such constructions: B alyek tesa 'other than this.'
Telling Time: Tocharian B employs the ablative to denote the initial point in expressions of time. For example: B eṣke āstaryai preśceyaimeṃ te täṅktsi 'to inhibit this from the cleansing time onward;' B ṣkas meñantse meṃ mante 'from the sixth of the month onward.'

Lesson 9

The Silk Road
The Silk Road refers to a complex of ancient trade routes extending roughly from eastern Europe to the heart of China. The term itself dates only to the 19th century and refers to what was merely one of the many goods transported over land via this web of mercantile passages. Though many of our ancient sources concerning these trade routes contain information either difficult to correlate with specific modern-day geographic and ethnographic knowledge or simply difficult to believe precisely because of modern-day knowledge, we nevertheless are certain of the important place in history the Silk Road holds, as a medium not only for the exchange of goods but also for the exchange of information and technology.

The route cuts through the heart of Central Asia, through the so-called "Stans" --- Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, as well as the northernmost reaches of Afghanistan and Pakistan --- a region known from time immemorial to be home to a wide variety of peoples from varied linguistic, ethnic and religious backgrounds. It is precisely where this trade route hits the westernmost extent of present-day China that we find the archaeological sites that provide us with Tocharian documents. To properly put the Tocharian documents and the people who wrote them in their cultural context, an admittedly cursory overview of some of the major ancient settlements and peoples of the region merits our attention.

Geography
The geographic setting is a striking mix of extremes. In the land surrounding the Aral Sea we find the southernmost extension of the great Siberian steppes. Into the western shore of the Aral Sea flows the Syr Darya, while into the southern shore flows the Amu Darya, feeding into the sea via a fertile delta suitable for cultivation. The plains continue to sweep south and east into the foothills of the so-called "Roof of the World." Here rise the Pamirs, sweeping southeast into the Hindu Kush. As one pushes farther east there loom the Qurum Mountains, to their east the Qaraqurum, and to the northeast of these the Altun. This provides the northern extent of Tibet, and if we return to the Pamirs and instead follow the southerly line to the east, we encounter the familiar and majestic Himalayas. If we backtrack once again to the Pamirs, we may this time push northeast and follow the line of the Tian Shan mountains, which provide the natural border between China's Xinjiang province to the south and Kyrgyzstan to the north.

The Tian Shan to the north and the Qurum, Qaraqurum and Altun to the south bracket with their claw the basin into which the Tarim river carries mountain waters until they finally dissipate into the sand. In the middle of all this is a forbidding, impassable desert called the Taklamakan (Turkic Täklimakan), all contained within the present borders of China. Such settlements as we find all line the rim of the desert, hovering close to the foothills of the looming mountain ranges.

Prehistory
Archaeological excavations show signs of habitation in Central Asia dating back at least to paleolithic times. This is evidenced by stone tools as well as cave dwellings that seem to have been seasonally inhabited along migration routes. We find a shift, some 10,000 years ago, from a typical hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one centered around agriculture and livestock. With this came a change to more permanent settlements, with roughly 30 houses built from clay grouped together in a community.

Agriculture was greatly facilitated in the sixth millenium BC by the advent of irrigation, at this early date mostly in the form of heaped up mounds of earth designed to divert flood water from the rivers. Naturally the fertile deltas of rivers such as the Amu Darya (historically known also as the Oxus), where it empties into the Aral Sea, were among the earliest sites of agriculture. Through the use of irrigation, agriculture was able to move to the upper banks of the river and then farther into the countryside in a region occasionally referred to as Transoxonia. Constructing such irrigation systems was of course a labor-intensive activity, and therefore required larger permanent populations (Frye, 1996; Roudik, 2007).

Not all inhabitants of the region chose to remain tied to a permanent settlement. In the third millenium BC we encounter evidence of northern tribes from parts of modern Kazakhstan that maintained a nomadic lifestyle while shifting from hunting to more pastoral pursuits of grazing livestock. At roughly the same time we find the appearance of copper and bronze tools, and only in the first millenium do we finally see the emergence of iron tools. Herdsmen seem early to have domesticated sheep and goats, but in the third and second millenia we also find domestication of camels and horses for pulling carts (Roudik, 2007; Kuzmina, 2008).

In connection with this southward expansion, certain specific archaeological sites are worth mentioning. In particular, archaeological finds identify three groups known as Afanasievo, Andronovo and Karasuk, which range over southern Siberia and Kazakhstan and appear to display a continuity supporting the notion of a spreading population characterized by warriors on chariots. The material finds of the Karasuk culture ultimately find their way to the Ferghana valley by roughly 1500 BC, and further evidence points to possible expansion beyond into Xinjiang (Frye, 1996; Roudik, 2007; Kuzmina, 2008).

As prehistory gives way to history at the beginning of the first millenium BC, we find the area in question encompassed by Parthia. By this time stable settlements had arisen in the river deltas near the Aral Sea, for example Khwarazm (or Khorezm, Gk. Chorasmia) at the mouth of the Amu Darya, and a Sogdian settlement along the Syr Darya. The Sogdians also appear to have established an oasis in Ferghana. We still however find a coexisting nomadic population, and by the middle of the first millenium BC we encounter the nomadic Massegetae inhabiting the region between the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. Persian and Greek accounts typically find little by which to distinguish the various populations and seem to consider them as a group, in particular with a generally similar mode of dress including a short tunic, wide belt, and trousers, with the same customs among nomadic and settled peoples alike (Roudik, 2007).

State formation in the region appears to have proceeded by way of tribal confederation. In this way the city of Khwarazm rose to prominence and extended its sway from the Aral Sea to the mountainous region to the south. Khwarazm maintained close ties with Bactria, a neighboring state centered upon the modern city of Balkh. Their political ties mirrored the many cultural and linguistic similarities the two states already shared. We also find the state of Margiana, centered at Merv, and the long-lived Sogdian state taking foothold in the region. These four major states occupied the areas of what is now Turkmenistan, northern Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.

Early Empires
The Persian king Cyrus, with a victory against the Medes to the east of Parthia in the mid-first millenium BC, finally managed to bring these areas under the dominion of what became the Achaemenid Empire. The Iranian-speaking influence that had entered Central Asia with the rise of Parthia now strengthened its hold, along with a more palpable presence of the Zoroastrian religion (Frye, 1996). Thus Khwarazm, Bactria, and Sogdiana all found new identities as satrapies within the new empire, under the purview of a central governor seated at Samarkand.

The loss of independence was not without its benefits. To be sure, taxes were now levied for the simple right to open irrigation canals feeding from the rivers which were now the emperor's property. But the imperial infrastructure also provided for construction of new irrigation canals. Moreover, the bureaucratic tendencies of the empire demanded skilled bookkeepers, and this in turn resulted in a generally higher level of education. And, finally, inclusion within the empire now brought a vast military might to bear when border provinces like Sogdiana felt the pressures of skirmishes along the trade routes leading out of the empire (Roudik, 2007).

In 334 BC, Alexander the Great turned his gaze toward Central Asia and launched a campaign with such force that it caused Darius III, the Persian emperor at the time, to flee to Bactria. There he was killed in an internal plot, and shortly thereafter Alexander took Samarkand, the principal city in Central Asia. Perhaps in any other region this would have ended Alexander's need for further campaigning; but as luck would have it, this only spurred the Sogdians to revolt, thereby extending Alexander's foray and fanning the flames of military ferocity. Another year of military operations finally brought an end to the resistance, but at the price of hundreds of thousands of Sogdian casualties and diminishing the prosperity of Sogdiana and Bactria. Nor could Alexander accomplish this victory by sheer military might, but rather through a strategy of winning over local leaders and accepting the Zoroastrian religion so pervasive in the region.

The consolidation of Alexander's rule in the region added to the religious diversity. Not only did the Iranian peoples maintain their Zoroastrian beliefs, but large numbers of Greek settlers imported their own religious practices to Bactria. At roughly this time we also see the first Buddhist monks entering the region from India.

Within a relatively short time after Alexander's death, his empire began to disintegrate. The governance of the Central Asian provinces fell to the Seleucids. In the middle of the third century BC, Bactria and Parthia again began a rise to prominence. These states maintained their hold through confederation until roughly the middle of the second century BC. At this time nomads from the region surrounding Syr Darya began to mint coins and construct fortifications (Roudik, 2007). China was of course ever watchful of the nomadic tribes along its borders, and at the beginning of the second century we find it extending its commercial contacts into the region of Sogdiana. From this time onward China maintained a presence in the region, a presence either greater or lesser depending on the degree to which conflicts with the nomadic tribes allowed them access to the major commercial centers. This opened the doors to the Far East and the regions that produced silk, which the Chinese often used as a means of payment in commerce. This era marks the rise of what we know as the Silk Road.

Major Settlements
As trade along the Silk Road increased, the ensuing prosperity fueled the growth of several settlements in the area of the Tarim Basin. These stations provided a staging ground for the interaction of various empires with interests in the region. Moreover the harsh terrain meant that, as these centers fell into the hands of one power or another, contact between Central Asia and China could effectively be cut off. Their strategic and commercial value therefore converted them into focal points for imperial aspirations in the surrounding regions.

Many of the most detailed reports about the size and makeup of these settlements come from Chinese sources. Mallory and Mair (2000) have provided an insightful and engaging study of the sources, and our discussion here will mainly review some of the highlights of their work.

Kašghar (Qäshqär, Chinese Shule) forms the gate between Bactria and Ferghana to the west and the Tarim Basin to the east. It is at this outpost that a traveller from the west must make a decision to follow a northerly or southerly route as the Silk Road forks and passes to either side of the Taklamakan desert. Chinese accounts recorded during the Han dynasty list Kašghar as containing 1,510 households, comprising 18,647 individuals, of which 2,000 could bear arms. From roughly the beginning of the second century BC to the beginning of the first century AD Kašghar formed an important garrison town in the Western Han dynasty, but subsequently fell under the control of Khotan to the south. General Ban Chao later retook the city and it remained intermittently thereafter part of the Chinese empire. Around the 7th century AD Kašghar pertained to the Tibetan empire, and in the 9th the encroaching Uyghurs took control.

But during the early part of the first century Kašghar formed part of the Kushan empire, rising to prominence for a time in the area. Evidently it was during this period that Buddhism came to Kašghar, and accounts mention that the city retained the Buddha's stone spittoon (though it was not the only city to make this claim). References to sacrifices to the sky god suggest that Buddhism by no means took hold in all pockets within the region, but rather that Zoroastrianism and perhaps other religions managed to coexist in Kašghar. By the 10th century Islam had mostly driven out opposing religions. There was little land suitable for cultivation, but the city was a primary source of wool, or felt, and carpets.

Kučā (Kucha, Chinese Qiuci) lies along the northern rim of the Tarim Basin, perched along the northern route of the Silk Road that skirts the Tängri Tagh (Chinese Tian Shan) mountain range. As mentioned above the northerly and southerly routes of the Silk Road divide at Kašghar to pass on either side of the Taklamakan desert. They rejoin again at Lopnur, to the east of the desert. The oasis of Kučā lies roughly at the midpoint of the northerly route. The northerly route itself divided at Kučā, one direction taking the traveler on to Lopnur, the other passing farther to the north over the Tängri Tagh themselves. In the middle of the first century BC Kučā was already under Chinese control, and in fact it was the seat of the governor of the Han dynasty's protectorate, a region that included all the outposts of the Tarim Basin. That status and the strategic location provided Kučā with a pivotal role in Chinese efforts to stave off the Xiongnu bands that constantly threatened attack from the north. At the same time, it appears that Kučā felt no particular allegiance to China, and its constant efforts to free itself from the empire's grip proved a thorn in China's side. In the 9th century, Kučā like Kašghar fell under the sway of the Uyghurs.

Chinese sources for the first few centuries BC comment on how the population was essentially tied to a settled way of life and not given to the nomadic wanderings of the Xiongnu. The settlement contained 6,970 households comprising 81,317 people, and apparently another 21,076 able to bear arms. Kučā was therefore largest among the cities of eastern Central Asia and simply dwarfed the nearest arm of Chinese authority in Wulei. Later descriptions from the Jin dynasty (AD 265-419) describe a city with a walled inner citadel and a thousand Buddhist shrines and cloisters. The city's dimensions evidently rivaled those of the Chinese capital at Chang'an. Chinese sources record that the agricultural resources of Kučā comprised millet, wheat, rice, legumes, hemp, grapevines and pomegranates, as well as horses, cattle, sheep and camels. Kučā's proximity to the mountains also implied a wealth of mineral goods: copper, iron, lead, gold, and tin among others. Kučā produced felt and rugs, and it remained a central point for trading silk. Commerce was facilitated by the exchange of cotton goods or copper, silver, or gold coins.

It should be mentioned that accounts record a custom in both Kašghar and Kučā whereby the native population used boards to flatten the backs of children's skulls, much like what is found among native populations in North and Central America. In Kučā men and women wore hair down to the nape of their neck, and they employed wool garments and caps. From what can be ascertained from the historical accounts, Buddhism was the primary religion in Kučā in the earliest centuries AD and likely even earlier. In line with Buddhist practice, inhabitants of Kučā typically cremated the dead.

Khotan (Chinese Yutian) was a settlement along the southerly route of the Silk Road around the Tarim Basin. Contrary to some of the other large commercial centers in the region, Khotan enjoyed a wealth of natural resources. Chief among these fortuitous natural circumstances was its location between the Yurung-kāsh and the Qara-qāsh rivers, which stem from the Qurum (Chinese Kunlun) mountains and actually extend all the way to the Tarim river itself. With these two sources to draw from, Khotan possessed ample resources for agriculture through irrigation. Moreover, the mulberry tree was native to the area, so that with silkworms and Chinese know-how Khotan was able to turn itself into the center of silk production for the region. An added benefit was that the Chinese had also invented a process for turning the mulberry into pulp for paper, and so from Khotan the first paper found its way into the region. Khotan, in addition to cotton and wool, sent from its vast supplies large quantities of jade to China. Accounts from the Han dynasty report that the city contained 3,300 households, comprising 19,300 people, of which 2,400 could bear arms.

Several legends surround Khotan. One concerns the dual personalities that factor into its legendary founding. In particular a few documents suggest that Khotan was originally founded as two separate colonies. One came from northwest India and was supposedly led by the son of king Aśoka himself; the other came from the east, led by an exiled Chinese king. After a decisive battle between the two settlements, they eventually coalesced under the rule of one of the founders (stories disagree as to which one). If nothing else the story perhaps derives from a desire to reflect the coexistence of Prakrit-speaking Buddhists alongside Chinese speakers: we in fact find Chinese coins in the area that have Prakrit writing on the reverse side. Chinese accounts testify to a hundred Buddhist monasteries in Khotan, with some 5,000 monks; but here too we find references to a 'celestial god' that suggests the persistence of Zoroastrianism.

Further accounts show an expansion of Khotan's power in the early first century AD. Evidently with the assistance of the Xiongnu nomads, Khotan was able to extend its influence as far as Kašghar to its northwest. Thus control of the southerly route of the Silk Road fell under control of Khotan and Krorän. This situation did not appeal to the Chinese, and so the general Ban Chao likewise came and annexed Khotan to the empire. Not without efforts to the contrary, Khotan nevertheless remained under Chinese control for the succeeding several centuries. At times the Turks threatened to wrest Khotan from the grip of the Chinese, but in the 8th century it was actually Tibet that managed to annex Khotan and much of the Tarim region.

Krorän (Chinese Loulan) provides an antipode to Kašghar across the Tarim Basin: if Kašghar is where the Silk Road divides to bypass the Talkamakan desert, Krorän is where the routes again combine, lending Krorän great strategic importance from the point of view of the Chinese. Krorän lies near the salt marshes of Lopnur, in earlier times an area fed by the Tarim river but bracketed by harsh deserts. Sources from the Han dynasty put the population at 1,570 households, comprising 14,100 people, of which 2,912 could bear arms. The mixture of salt and sand prevented any hope of local agriculture, and the city survived on goods brought in by trade. This furnished a somewhat symbiotic relationship with nomadic peoples from the region, and we find there signs of numerous asses, horses and camels. Krorän for its part formed a center for trade in jade, rushes, tamarisk and balsam poplar.

Krorän appears to have been caught between warring states since its earliest history. In the early second century BC the nomadic Xiongnu of the north annexed the city and from there managed to harass the Han empire. The Chinese naturally found this situation intolerable, and at the end of the first century BC it fell to invading Chinese forces. Krorän nevertheless continued to vacillate between the two powers for the next two centuries. Finally Ban Chao's son, Ban Yong, sent a group of 500 colonists to the region in the first century AD to solidify China's hold. This militarized presence had the added benefit of managing against great odds to produce functional irrigation canals in a difficult river system. Documents uncovered on the site of the colony show that in the time leading up to its abandonment in the fourth century AD, Chinese was apparently spoken alongside Prakrit and another language native to its inhabitants.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following excerpt continues the Tocharian B text B107 (THT 107) from the previous lesson.

We find in line 13 the collocation ostameṃ ltu, literally 'left the house'. This however is something of a set phrase in Buddhist literature (cf. Pinault, 2008), meaning that one has set out on religious wanderings. Thus the phrase in context means 'become a monk' or 'enter the saṃgʰa'. As Pinault points out, the usage has an exact parallel in A waṣtäṣ lantu, and its use in such context allows us to pin down the meaning of A waṣt B ost 'house'. Namely, the term represents more than merely a family dwelling structure: it denotes organized village society in general. This parallels the distinction in Sanskrit between the grāma- 'village' and araṇya- 'forest'.

Translation
13 The mendicant Upaga went up to the sisters (and) said to them: "Sisters, I have left the house a worthy recipient. Therefore give me this porridge in charity." 14 They said to him, "This porridge is not to be eaten by you. Should there be a stranger, a sage having exerted himself in austerity, (who is) best among sages, to him we will give this porridge in charity." 15 Upaga's hopes were dashed. He went on his way. 16 Nanda lifted the porridge (and) her sister Nandabala went after her. They went (and) entered the forest to seek a great sage worthy (of reward).
Grammar
41 Interrogative & Relative Pronouns
In a rare burst of simplicity, the pared-down paradigm of the Tocharian relative and interrogative pronouns allows our weary minds a brief respite from the labors of memorizing seemingly innumerable classes of all kind of words, along with their various exceptions. We forthwith present the paradigm for A kus-ne 'he who, that which, etc.'; A kus 'who? which?'; and B kuse 'who? which?; he who, that which'.

 	 	A Relative	 	A Interrogative	 	B Interrogative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N	 	kus-ne	 	kus	 	kuse
G	 	ke-ne	 	ke	 	ket(e)
Obl.	 	kuc-ne	 	kuc	 	kuce
We pause for a moment so that you may admire....

Tocharian B employs kuse and its forms as both a relative pronoun and as an interrogative pronoun. Specifically, as a relative it occurs in situations similar to the English 'who' and 'whom' in 'I saw the man who was walking towards me...,' 'The man whom you met...,' and the like; as an interrogative it functions similar to 'who' and 'whom' in 'Who was walking towards me?', 'Whom did you meet yesterday?', etc. Tocharian A does not employ exactly the same forms for both relative and interrogative, but mercifully forms the former from the latter by the regular appending of the suffix -ne. In both languages a single form serves to denote any grammatical (or biological) gender and any number.

Tocharian A kus B kuse bear a striking resemblance to interrogative and relative pronouns in other archaic Indo-European languages, leaving little doubt as to their PIE ancestor. The likely evolution follows the pattern of the chart below.

 	 	PIE	 	 	 	PToch	 	 	 	A	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nominative	 	*kʷi-s + so	 	*kʷiso	 	*kwäsæ	 	 	 	kus	 	kusé	 	Hitt. kuis, Lat. quis
Oblique	 	*kʷi-to-m	 	 	 	*kwätæ	 	*kwäcæ	 	kuc	 	kucé	 	Hitt. kuin, Lat. quem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Genitive	 	*kʷoyyo-	 	 	 	*kwæiyæ	 	*kai	 	ke	 	 	 	Gk. poĩos, Lat. cuius
 	 	*kʷo-to-s	 	 	 	*kwætæ	 	*kætæ	 	 	 	kete	 	 
In the nominative form *kʷi-s + so we actually have a collocation of the proper nominative to the stem *kʷi- followed by the nominative masculine of the common deictic pronoun *so (cf. Section 31, Lesson 7). The geminate (doubled) consonant *-ss- that ensued was evidently already simplified to *-s- within Proto-Indo-European itself. The oblique (PIE accusative) form *kʷi-to-m also displays the deictic stem *to-; but we notice that in the Proto-Tocharian period the dental *-t- undergoes palatalization to *-c-, evidently in accordance with a general tendency among pronominal elements to exhibit palatalization outside of the nominative case. The genitive forms appear to have different origins between the two languages; in either situation however it appears that the most likely origin in PIE is an adjectival stem, *kʷoyyo- or *kʷwo-.

The relative pronoun in the oblique, A kuc-ne B kuce, may play the role of a causal conjunction: 'on account of, since, because'. This parallels the Sanskrit usage of yad, the neuter accusative of the relative pronoun, which may also be used to introduce subordinate clauses with causal sense.

We also find in the Tocharian languages a rather rare interrogative pronoun, A äntsaṃ B intsu 'who? which?'. The following chart lists the extant forms.

 	 	A Relative	 	A Interrogative	 	B Interrogative
Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	äntsan-ne	 	äntsaṃ	 	intsu
G	 	 	 	äñcani	 	 
Obl.	 	äñcan-ne	 	äñcaṃ	 	iñcew, iñcau
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
G Pl.	 	 	 	äñcesni	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	 
Obl. Sg.	 	 	 	äntāṃ	 	 
As with A kus B kuse, Tocharian A marks a distinction between the relative and interrogative pronouns by appending -ne to the former; Tocharian B however employs the same forms for both relative and interrogative. If we imagine the -t- to have arisen from secondary phonetic processes like those we have encountered in the historical phonology, then we see rather clearly that this pronoun derives from a nasal element A än- B in- followed by forms of the demonstrative pronoun A saṃ B su. The origin of the nasal element remains somewhat mysterious.

We find in Tocharian B exclusively one further pronoun mäksu. As with the others in Tocharian B, this is employed as both interrogative and relative. The following chart lists the extant forms.

 	 	B Masculine	 	B Feminine	 	B Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	mäksu	 	mäksāu	 	mäktu
G	 	mäkcwi, mäkcpi	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	mäkceu	 	mäktāu, mäktāw	 	mäktu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	mäkcai	 	mäktoṃ	 	 
G	 	mäkcenas	 	mäktoynas	 	 
This pronoun evidently derives from the composition of a number of elements. We see in the paradigm the forms of the demonstrative B su or seṃ. The origin of the leading element mäk- remains somewhat obscure. One likely possibility however (Pinault 2008) is that this too derives from composition, in particular of the same PIE *kʷi- encountered above and another element mä- perhaps related ultimately to PIE *mo- as found, e.g., in Hitt. mān, mahhan 'how?'

In practice, there is little difference in usage between B kuse and B mäksu. There does seem however to be a slight preference for the use of mäksu where Sanskrit employs the interrogative adjective Skt. katara-, katama- 'which one (of many)?'

42 Noun Classes V and VI
Noun classes V and VI represent nouns with different nominative and oblique plurals, that is, nouns generally derived from original PIE animates. We find the following overarching division: Class V collects nouns whose plural reflects an alternation PIE *-i vs. *-ns in the nominative and accusative plural; Class VI by contrast shows an alternation PIE *-es vs. *-ns in nominative and accusative plural. The separation is not quite so clean, since loss of final consonants and subsequent contraction of vowels also means that many PIE *i- and *u-stems, with nominative plural in *-es, have also fallen into Class V; Class VI generally reflects original PIE *n-stem nouns. Each class contains further subdivisions based on the particular stem shapes encountered and their ensuing reflexes. The following chart displays the endings characterizing the subdivision.

Class	 	Subclass	 	A N. Pl.	 	B N. Pl.	 	Notes
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
V	 	1	 	-e	 	-i	 	Original thematic *-o-
 	 	2	 	-yi	 	-yi	 	Original *i-stem
 	 	3	 	 	 	-yi	 	Original *u-stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VI	 	1	 	-iñ	 	-iñ	 	Original *-en-stem
 	 	2	 	 	 	-aiñ	 	Original *-ōn-stem
 	 	3	 	-āñ	 	-āñ	 	Original *-ōn-stem
 	 	4	 	-añ	 	-eñ	 	Original *-on-stem
In each instance, the oblique plural derives from PIE *-ns, giving uniformly A -s B -ṃ. The vowel preceding the final nasal in Tocharian B generally replicates the vowel of the nominative plural ending; therefore practically speaking the accusative plural form is superfluous for the purposes of classification and we may simply list the nominative plural as in the chart above. For a discussion of the historical evolution of these endings, see Section 27.1 in Lesson 6.

The chart below illustrates the declension of Class V.1 with the forms of the nouns A oṅk B eṅkwe masc. 'man' and A yuk B yakwe masc. 'horse'. The former illustrates the declension of nouns denoting humans, the latter non-human nouns. We have already seen the majority of these forms in Section 12.2 of Lesson 3; the salient forms are repeated here for convenience.

The traditional classification into the above subgroups on synchronic grounds generally depends on the nominative and oblique singular in Tocharian B. In particular, Class V.2 shows B -e in the nominative singular and -Ø in the oblique; meanwhile Class V.3 shows -Ø in both the nominative and oblique singular.

Below we illustrate the declensions VI.1 and VI.2 with the nouns A ri B riye fem. 'city', A pyāpi B pyāpyo fem. 'flower', and A ak B ek alt. 'eye'. In terms of the classification into subclasses 1-4, it is enough to distinguish based on the nominative plural forms. Each of these subclasses does, however, have further subdivisions based on the forms of the singular. We need not focus on such fine distinctions for the moment.

Note that A ak B ek exhibits paral forms; in particular, we only find paral forms --- no plural --- for this word outside of the singular in Tocharian A. The traditional distinction between the above paradigms of subclass VI.2 is based synchronically on the forms of the nominative and oblique singular within Tocharian B, either nominative and oblique in -o and -ai respectively, or -Ø in both forms.

Finally we illustrate the subclasses VI.3 and VI.4 with the nouns A käntu (masc. or fem.) B kantwo (masc.) 'tongue', A āre 'plough', and B saswe masc. 'man'.

43 Privative
Tocharian possesses a further special verbal adjective known as the privative. As the name suggests (Lat. prīvāre 'rob, deprive'), this verbal adjective has a connotation of negation or lack. In particular, both Tocharian languages employ this construction in any of three basic senses: specifically the privative may denote

an action that has not yet happened;
an action that can not possibly happen;
an action that should not happen.
The first sense merely relates factual information from the point of view of the speaker, similar in sense to English "(left) undone" built to the verb "do". The latter two constitute assertions of a sort: the former maintains a connotation somewhat like a negated Gerundive I, with a sense similar to English "un-doable"; the latter takes something of the sense of a negated Gerundive II, similar to English "not to be done".

The formation of the privative involves addition of the suffix A -t B -tte, as well as a negative prefix A a(n)- B e(n)-. The construction is exceedingly rare in Tocharian A, leaving only a handful of isolated forms (here listed with their Tocharian B equivalents): A atäṅkät B etaṅkätte 'unhindered', A apälkāt B empalkaitte (empālkatte) 'unconcerned', A asinät B ontsoytte 'insatiable'. In Tocharian B the privative remains a productive construction. We list below the privative forms for the root B yām- 'do, make'.

Privative	 	B Masc.	 	B Fem.
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ayāmätte	 	ayāmäcca
G	 	ayāmcepi	 	 
Obl.	 	ayāmäcce	 	ayāmäccai
V	 	ayāmäccu	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	ayāmäcci	 	ayāmttona
G	 	ayāmäccemts	 	 
Obl.	 	ayāmacceṃ	 	ayāmttona
The privative B ayāmätte has the sense 'not to be done', similar to Latin nōn faciendus. For the declension, compare the Class I derived adjectives in B -tstse (Section 13.2, Lesson 3).

We find similar constructions in the other early Indo-European languages. For example, take Gk. ámbrotos and Skt. amṛto-, both 'immortal', from PIE *ṇ-mṛ-to-, an adjective in *-to- built to the verbal root (here *mṛ-) and accompanied by the negative prefix *ṇ-. It will therefore come as little surprise that the Tocharian privative likewise appears to derive from an adjective based on PIE *-to- and adjoined to the negative prefix *ṇ-. The evolution of the prefix provides little surprise: PIE *ṇ- > PToch *æ(n)- > A a(n)- B e(n)-. We do however find variation, typically as the result of umlaut triggered by the following (root) vowel, or by the following (root-initial) consonant cluster. In particular we find the evolution outlined in the following chart.

PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	A	 	B	 	Notes
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*ṇ-	 	*æ(n)-	 	 	 	a(n)-	 	e(n)-	 	 
*ṇ-CV-	 	*æ(n)-CV-	 	*ā(n)-CV-	 	 	 	a(n)-	 	when V is PToch *ā, *ai or *au
*ṇ-CV-	 	*æ(n)-CV-	 	*o(n)-CV-	 	 	 	o(n)-	 	when V is PToch *o or when PToch *nC > *mp
Thus we find in Tocharian B the prefix a(n)- when the root vowel or diphthong causes *a-umlaut; and we find o(n)- when either the root vowel causes *o-umlaut or the combination of *æ(n)- with the following root-initial consonant results in the cluster -mp-.

The exact evolution of the adjectival suffix is slightly more tricky. The privative suffix in the documented languages is A -t B -tte. The geminate -tt- in Tocharian B has led some scholars to suspect the origin lies in a PIE suffix *-two-. Two basic problems arise: on the one hand, Tocharian A shows no geminate, and on the other hand, the Tocharian A reflex should then be A *-tu. For this reason some scholars (cf. Pinault 2008) suggest the double -t- in Tocharian B likely represents scribal practice to ensure pronunciation of a true dental stop rather than a fricative between vowels. If this is indeed the correct interpretation, that would allow a reconstruction A -t B -tte < PToch *-tæ < PIE *-to-, leading back to the same suffix found in other IE languages.

Though the affixal structure *ṇ-...-to- appears to parallel that found in Gk. ámbrotos and Skt. amṛto-, the Tocharian privative does not add these affixes directly to the root as in Greek and Sanskrit. Rather it seems that a likely origin for the privative stem lies with the subjunctive. Note the following examples.

Root	 	Present	 	Subjunctive	 	Privative	 	Meaningn
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B klautk-	 	klautkotär (IV)	 	klautkaṃ (V)	 	aṅklautkatte	 	turn
B käm-	 	känmaṣṣäṃ (IX)	 	śämt (II)	 	ekamätte	 	come
The subjunctive stem shows clearly in the privative of the root B klautk- 'turn'. With B käm-, however, it seems that in particular the privative stem must derive from the weak stem of the subjunctive, here B *kämä- rather than B *śämä-: PToch *æ(n)-kämä-tæ > B ekamätte. But in this particular example we might just as well find a construction built directly to the root (Pinault 2008), parallel to what we find elsewhere in IE: PIE *ṇ-gʷṃ-to- > PToch *æ(n)-kʷäm-tæ- > B ekamätte, though this requires the insertion of an anaptyctic vowel.

44 Imperative
The Tocharian imperative does not exhibit any distinctive stem, but rather employs either a preterite or subjunctive stem. The imperative does however show a new set of personal endings. These endings only include forms for the second person singular, dual, and plural. There is however one isolated form, päklyossū, which appears to denote a third person singular imperative. The following chart lists the imperative endings for Tocharian A and B.

Imperative	 	A	 	 	 	 	 	B
Active	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Sg.	 	-Ø	 	 	 	 	 	-Ø
2 Du.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Pl.	 	-s	 	 	 	 	 	-s(o)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Mediopassive	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Sg.	 	-r	 	 	 	 	 	-r
3	 	(-sū)	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Du.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-ait
2 Pl.	 	-c	 	 	 	 	 	-t
In addition to the above endings, the Tocharian imperative also employs a prefix AB p- whose vocalism varies depending on the root. In particular, though the prefix always appears in Tocharian A, it regularly falls away in Tocharian B when the root begins with p-: e.g. AB pärk- 'request' shows second person plural mediopassive imperative PToch *pä-pärksā-c > A ppärksāc B parksat. We also commonly find simplification of the ensuing consonant cluster in Tocharian B: tāka for ptāka, second person singular active imperative built to the suppletive past stem tāk- of the verb nes- 'be'. In Tocharian A, the prefix appears as pu- before consonants which we historically labiovelars: PToch *pä-kʷäm-äs > A pukmäs 'come you (all)!', from A kum- 'come'. In Tocharian B, we find pe- in the singular imperative pete, built to the root B ai- 'give'. We also find po- in a handful of verbs: for example B pokse < B āks- 'show', B pokkāka < B kāk- 'call', B poñ < B weñ- 'speak'. The conditions which govern the vowel quality of the prefix remain somewhat unclear. Only a small number of verbs display the consonant doubling we find in B pokkāka, from the root B kāk- 'call'.

The prefix may derive from the same source as the prefix po- found in Old Church Slavonic and pē- in Hittite. The assumption of an original PIE *po-, however, would require an evolution PIE *po- > PToch *pæ- > *pä-. This somewhat uncommon evolution does however find some support in a development *mo- > *mæ- > *mä- perhaps found with some pronouns and adverbs.

44.1 Classes i-v
Tocharian displays five basic classes of imperative formation, with an additional class comprising those verbs with so-called irregular formations. In essence the imperative classes recapitulate the preterite classes, employing the same stem formations. The following chart displays the basic imperative class distinctions alongside the corresponding preterite formations.

Class	 	Stem Shape	 	A Pret.	 	B Pret.	 	A Impt.	 	B Impt.	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
i	 	PIE *-H-	 	śärs	 	śarsa	 	päkras	 	pkārsa	 	Hitt. kars-, Lat. scīre
ii	 	PIE *CV-CVC, CēC	 	kakäl	 	kālaṃ	 	pkäl	 	 	 	Lat. colere, Skt. cárati
iii	 	PIE *-s	 	arsāt	 	ersate	 	parsār	 	persat	 	Gk. õrsa, Skt. ṛṇóti
iv	 	PToch *-ṣṣā-	 	kākätkṣuräṣ	 	kakātkäṣṣu	 	 	 	pkātkäṣṣat	 	Gk. gētʰéō
v	 	PToch *-ñ(ñ)-	 	weñār	 	weñāre	 	 	 	poñ	 	Gk. eĩpon, Lat. vōx
Generally speaking, a verb will take the same class in the imperative that it takes in the preterite, but there are several exceptions where a verb's preterite belongs to one class but its imperative to another. The following chart provides some examples.

Root	 	Subjunctive	 	Preterite	 	Imperative	 	Meaning

B taṅkw-	 	täṅkwaṃ (xii)	 	 	 	pätaṅkwaññe (v)	 	love
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
B āks-	 	ākṣäṃ (ii)	 	ākṣa (I)	 	pokse (vi)	 	proclaim
We notice in the above chart that occasionally the imperative form bears a closer resemblance to the corresponding subjunctive than to the corresponding preterite. This is particularly true of verbs of imperative Class i, such as the stem AB kärs- 'know' shown above. Recall from the discussion of Section 34.1, Lesson 7, that Class I preterites exhibit the results of an original PIE alternation between *e-grade in the active singular forms, and *Ø-grade elsewhere. This in particular leads to the palatalization of the root-initial consonant *ke- > PToch *śä-. The imperative however lacks this palatalization altogether. If we recall on the other hand the discussion of Section 29.2.2, Lesson 6, we note that CLASS v subjunctives generally derive from verbs with root-final laryngeals (the same source as the PToch *ā-marker of Class I preterites); moreover this stem-final *-ā- causes umlaut of a preceding PToch *æ < *o, yielding PToch root vowel *ā. Therefore CLASS v subjunctives show an ablaut pattern of PToch *-ā- vs. *-ä-, with no attendant palatalization of the root-initial consonants. This is precisely the situation we find in the paradigm of certain Class i imperatives like AB kärs-. Another such verb is PIE *TerK- > AB tärk- 'let go'. We place the subjunctive (Section 29.2.2) and preterite (Section 34.1) paradigms of this verb alongside the imperative paradigm for comparison.

One interesting feature of the relation between imperative and subjunctive is that, even when the imperative does not derive from the preterite stem, it still derives from another stem (subjunctive) with perfective aspect. This provides a nice counterpoint to the prefixation with *pä-, if in fact derived from PIE *po-, since the latter figures prominently in perfective verbal aspect among the Slavic languages.

Thus we see that Class i imperatives are generally associated with verbs exhibiting Class I preterites or CLASS v subjunctives. The ablaut pattern of the root follows that of the CLASS v subjunctives. Class ii imperatives, in like fashion, are typically associated with verbs showing Class II preterites. In Tocharian B these typically display second person singular active ending -a after a root with short root vowel; the ending is lacking when the root vowel is long. Class iii imperatives show the ṣ-suffix characteristic of the Class III preterites, though this suffix only appears regularly in the mediopassive forms. Class iv imperatives are all causatives. They display the ṣṣ-suffix (-āṣ- in Tocharian A) appropriate to either the Class IV preterites or the CLASS ix subjunctives (or, equivalently, CLASS IX presents). The verbs A läm- 'sit', B kätk- 'proceed', B mäsk- 'exchange', and B tsälp- 'be free (of)' form Class iv imperatives, in natural association with their CLASS ix (causative) subjunctives, even though they have Class II preterites. Imperative Class v, containing few verbs, shows the suffix -ññ-, generally in line with associated preterite Class V or subjunctive CLASS xii.

We show below imperative forms of the verb AB käl- 'lead, bring' to illustrate the Class i conjugation. Alongside these forms we display those of A klyos- B klyaus- 'hear', which shows palatalization of the root-final consonant.

44.2 Class vi: Irregular Imperatives
Class vi consists of a small number of verbs that show imperative forms differing from the patterns discussed above. We collect them in this section. Certain verbs pertain to the sixth class of imperatives in both Tocharian languages. The following chart lists their extant forms.

 	 	A i-	 	B i-	 	A e-	 	B ai-	 	B täl-

45 Tense and Aspect
We have scattered throughout these lessons various comments pertaining to verbal aspect as exhibited in Tocharian. We collect here some of these observations to put them in clearer perspective.

Recall that linguists distinguish two basic features of a verb: tense and aspect. Tense refers to when an action occurs relative to the speaker: before (past), simultaneous with (present), or after (future) the moment of utterance. Aspect, by contrast, refers to how the speaker conceives of an action: completed (perfective), ongoing (imperfective or durative), denoting a state of existence (stative). Where tense and aspect exist in a linguistic system, tense is typically marked morphologically; aspect may be marked by the semantics of the verb itself, or by morphological means, or by a combination of the two.

Tense and aspect are independent characterizations of a verb, that is, any aspect may occur in any tense, at least in principle: past perfective, present perfective, past imperfective, present stative, etc. In practice, however, certain aspects maintain certain connotations that may lead to certain co-occurrences of tense-aspect pairs: for example, completed (perfective) aspect generally prohibits an action from co-occurring with the entire duration of an utterance; the verbal notion marked as perfective therefore likely has already occurred or is as yet about to occur. In the event that it has already occurred, this can predispose the speaker to choosing past tense along with perfective aspect, or to allow perfective aspect alone to connote prior completion, in effect producing a past tense without the need to mark it so. Similarly, if the event has not yet occurred, the speaker may choose to associate the perfective aspect with future tense, or allow the perfective aspect alone to connote futurity. In this way we see how many languages make do solely with a morphological system of aspectual distinctions, with no overt tense marking: the connotations of the verbal aspect go a long way to placing an action in time relative to the speaker.

Within the Tocharian verbal system we may describe certain harbingers of a system of verbal aspect. The present tense generally expresses imperfective aspect. When the semantics of a verbal root inherently denote perfectivity (think of, e.g., arrive in English -- you either arrive or you don't, so it's inherently perfective; there is no ongoing, unfinished arrival), the present conjugation of the verb typically belongs to a class employing a suffix with durative connotations. In addition the Tocharian imperfect typically imparts imperfect aspect on a verb form: this largely follows as a result of Tocharian building the imperfect on the present verbal stem.

Perfective aspect likewise finds expression in two principal manners, but these remain more distinct due to the fact that they generally involve independent verbal stems. In particular, the Tocharian preterite denotes a past action with perfective aspect, while the Tocharian subjunctive denotes a present action with perfective aspect. This latter helps account for its frequent role as a simple future tense. Finally the Tocharian imperative evidently expresses perfective aspect; as with the imperfect tense, this seems to arise secondarily. Specifically, the Tocharian imperative takes its stem from the preterite, or occasionally the subjunctive, which themselves mark perfective aspect. The prefix typical of the imperative, with the Slavic languages in mind, likely bolsters this perfective aspect.

Consider a specific example of how such patterns of aspect and tense play out in Tocharian. In particular we may focus on CLASS vi subjunctives. As we noted in Lesson 6, Section 29.3, verbs with CLASS vi subjunctives (suffix *-nā-) generally show corresponding presents in CLASS X (suffix *-nā-sk-). Across the early Indo-European languages, the suffix *-sḱ- often retains an iterative sense. This suggests that, as *-nā- came to be associated with the subjunctive and perfective aspect, there arose among the verbs employing *-nā- in the subjunctive the need for a renewed imperfective formation. For this Tocharian co-opted the iterative *-sḱ- suffix and produced a durative, hence present, marker *-nāsk-.

We find in Tocharian that the aspectual distinction imparted by a particular verb class suffix depends substantially on the particular history of that verb stemming from Proto-Indo-European times. For instance the nasal infix, for its part, generally denotes durative or imperfective aspect in Indo-European. This likely underlies its appearance in CLASS VI presents (Lesson 5, Section 24.3). The fact that the verbs of this class historically employed in PIE an additional marker, *-n-, to elicit an imperfective or durative sense suggests that these verbs were in fact root-perfective or aoristic --- that is, the root without the infix denoted a perfective action in PIE terms. Recall from the discussion of tense and aspect in PIE from the Lesson 3 introduction that these roots therefore typically formed unmarked, or root, preterites in PIE itself. But root preterites evidently formed the backbone of the subsequent Class I preterites in Tocharian. We should therefore expect an association in Tocharian between nasal-infixed presents and root preterites, and this is what we find: verbs with CLASS VI (nasal infix) presents typically show Class I preterites (root-aorists). We similarly find that the root thematic subjunctives (CLASS ii) tend to employ suffixes *-s- or *-sk- in their corresponding present formations (cf. Lesson 6, Section 29.3.1).

Thus we find a rather intricate historical development that leads for the most part logically to the particular verb classes and class associations we find within Tocharian. We must however allow for occasional variation in what stem (present, subjunctive, or preterite) the Tocharian speakers feel to be 'dominant' or 'primary' for a given verb, or we should allow different stems of the same verb to 'dissociate' over time. For example, consider English ought: formerly the only past tense form of owe, its modal use so came to dominate its usage that it was no longer felt to be part of the same verbal complex as owe; the latter thereby developed a new past tense form owed. Returning to Tocharian, suppose for example that we take a PIE verb with root-final laryngeal, PIE *CXH-, where X represents any unknown element preceding the laryngeal. If the lexical semantics of the root are perfective, as with English arrive, then we might expect this root to form a root-preterite, and perhaps employ a nasal infix *CXnH- to create a durative present. Now, if the semantics stay the same within Tocharian, we subsequently expect a root-preterite formation (Class I) and a nasal infix present (CLASS VI). Thus the reflex PToch *-nā- of the final *-nH- of the root logically becomes associated with present durativity in Proto-Tocharian. On the other hand, the new durative stem PIE *CXnH- could be taken as primary, or dissociated, within Proto-Tocharian. If the verb nevertheless maintains the same semantics (lexical perfectivity), then *-nH- > PToch *-nā- will become associated with perfective aspect, and Tocharian will seek a new, additional durative marker. Thus we might expect a nasal infix subjunctive (CLASS vi) and a present with a nasal compound suffix (CLASS X).

In this way we may start to make sense of the particular associations we find between different classes of Tocharian present, subjunctive and preterite formation. Though English he owes denotes the present and formerly he ought simply denoted the past tense of the same utterance (equivalent to he owed), ought subsequently shifted categories and currently only stands as a modal denoting a (tenseless) obligation (he ought = he should). In Tocharian we find similar category shifts between present, subjunctive and preterite. And as verbs of similar phonological and morphological shape undergo the same shifts, we find that certain PIE markers like *-n- which had a unique valence (e.g. durative) in PIE now have a plurality of valences (e.g. present and durative, or subjunctive and perfective) within Tocharian.

Nomadic Peoples
As we have seen, Central Asia in general, and the Tarim Basin in particular, have provided the backdrop for the rise and fall of numerous empires and for the ebb and flow of a varied system of trade. In such a fluid and vibrant region, one naturally expects the confluence of numerous peoples of varied backgrounds, and this is exactly what appears in the historical record. In particular the historical documents of the Chinese Han period provide descriptions of a wealth of cultures inhabiting the general region, many of whom scholars are still trying to correlate with known peoples from archaeological or other historical records. We take a moment here to discuss them in broad outline.

Chinese records of the Han Dynasty mention a people called the Xiongnu. If they may indeed be linked with the northern 'barbarians' mentioned in slightly earlier documents, then this nomadic people proved a constant threat to the Chinese state from the 8th century BC onwards. They only enter the written record by name in the 3rd century BC. This culture predominantly raised horses, cattle and sheep, and to a lesser extent other animals such as camels and mules. They were a fearsome group that believed it was every male's duty to fight in war and to repose in relative leisure otherwise. They were skilled horsemen fond of the bow and arrow, and employed iron swords in close combat. They pressed those captives who escaped the sure release of death into indentured servitude. The Xiongnu early inhabited regions to the north of the Chinese, and followed a lifestyle still reflected in modern Mongolian culture, with the felt-walled yurts and tending of livestock. From these northerly regions they descended upon the Chinese with such fury that the latter built barricades to repel their assault. These were later joined in the 3rd century to form the 3,000-mile-long structure we today recognize as the Great Wall. This channeled their expansion toward what the Chinese termed the Western Regions, where they took to the eastern edge of the Tarim Basin. Here among other things they found the great iron deposits needed to produce their weapons. The Xiongnu presence in the Western Regions prompted the initial westward expansion of the Chinese empire in the 2nd century BC. The Chinese overpowered the Xiongnu for a time, but the latter rose again to assert their dominance. Power in the region continued to shift between the two, until finally in the 1st century AD the Han dynasty was able to effectively drive the Xiongnu from the region.

The Xiongnu do not seem to have entered the Tarim Basin in peace, but rather subjugated the Wusun and Yuezhi upon arrival. The Wusun apparently inhabited a region to the northeast of the Tarim Basin, likely in the Ferghana region, perhaps near Lake Balkhash. They formed a remarkably large population: 120,000 households, comprising 630,000 individuals, of which 188,800 could bear arms. In this early period the Chinese pronunciation of their tribal name was likely *osǝn or *uo-suǝn, leading some scholars to associate them with Asiani mentioned by Pompeius Trogus in the 1st century BC, or with the Issedones mentioned even earlier by Herodotus (Mallory & Mair, 2000). The Wusun evidently made their presence felt over a large expanse, since one Wusun band destroyed a Chinese outpost in the 1st century BC which some scholars suggest might have been located near Lopnur. Early in the second century BC the Wusun remained under Xiongnu dominion, but by the end of the first century they had shaken off Xiongnu rule. To further their own interests, the Chinese entreated the Wusun to settle ever more toward the east, thereby occupying the land claimed by the Xiongnu and thereby forcing the latter out of the region. The Xiongnu quickly understood the motives of the Chinese and commenced entreaties of their own with the Wusun.

One particularly interesting mention of the Wusun occurs in the work of Yan Shigu (AD 579--645): 'Of all the Rong of the Western Regions the Wusun looked the most peculiar. Those of the present Hu [Barbarians] who have cerulean eyes and red beards and look like Mi monkeys are their descendents.' (Mallory & Mair, 2000) This description is often interpreted as identifying European physical characteristics as viewed through Chinese eyes.

The Yuezhi fell victim to the aspirations of the Xiongnu and their alliance with the Wusun. As the Xiongnu, assisted by the Wusun, descended into the Gansu, the region east of the Tarim Basin, the Yuezhi fled west. In their retreat they split into two groups, Great and Lesser. The latter pushed south and was assimilated into the Qiang culture of the Tibetan region. The Great Yuezhi however were driven by the Wusun through Ferghana, until the Yuezhi finally impinged on Sogdiana and in turn drove the Sakas into Bactria. The Yuezhi themselves finally pushed into Bactria near the close of the second century BC. They divided the region into five provinces. One of these subsequently expanded to dominate the remaining states: this province was known as Guishuang, the Chinese rendering of Kushan (Kuśāṇa).

At the time the great annals of the Han Dynasty, the Hanshu, were composed, the Yuezhi inhabited the region north of the Oxus river and west of Ferghana. The capital Jianshi contained some 100,000 households, comprising 400,000 individuals, of which 100,000 could bear arms. They were thus a force to be reckoned with, and they exercised considerable influence in the Tarim Basin. The Chinese accounts say that, though originally nomadic, their cultural practices were similar to those of the Parthians. The people were evidently characterized by a 'reddish-white color' of the skin, possessed numerous horses, and were skilled in horse-mounted archery. (Mallory & Mair, 2000) The Chinese had already successfully requested their influence in the first and second centuries AD in preventing Sogdian assistance in Kašghar and in attacking Turfan. As the Yuezhi came to inhabit Bactria, their empire saw its greatest extent under the rule of Kaniṣka: from the Aral Sea and Indus river in the west to the Ganges, Kashmir, and the frontier of Xinjiang in the east. The culture was profusely cosmopolitan: coins depicted Greek, Iranian and Indian gods; the king enjoyed such titles as Indic mahārājasa 'great king', Iranian rājatirājasa 'king of kings', a translation of a Chinese epithet devaputrasa 'son of heaven', and even kaïsarasa 'Caesar'. (Mallory & Mair, 2000) Though Zorastrianism, Jainism and Hinduism all coexisted within the empire, the Kushan empire in addition provided the vehicle for the Great Vehicle, Mahayana Buddhism, to spread into the Tarim Basin and beyond into China and ultimately Japan. Through this religious influx Buddhist monks and the Prākrit language spread throughout the region, carrying along with them a distinctive art that united a range of cultural influences. As Yuezhi influence declined over the course the 4th century AD, a Turkic people known as the Hephthalites invaded in the fifth century and pushed their conquests as far south as India. They held the remnants of the Kushan empire for the better part of a century, until they too were dislodged.

The Hephthalites were eventually displaced by Turks invading in the mid-sixth century AD. This brought them face to face with the Sogdians, whose homeland Sogdiana was situated between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, with capital in Samarkand. We have already seen that the Sogdians gave none other than Alexander the Great a run for his money during his campaigns in the region. In the intervening time the Sogdians had fractured into a number of smaller states, but they maintained an entrepreneurial spirit which led them to dominate commerce along the Silk Road. Their Iranian-derived language provided the lingua franca along the Silk Road for much of the Middle Ages. (Mallory & Mair, 2000)

By the middle of the seventh century AD the Chinese had largely diminished the strength of the Turks from Samarkand eastwards. But in Mongolia a series of revolts culminated in the seventh century with the Turkic Uyghurs presenting the Chinese emperor with the head of the last king of the Turks. The Uyghurs themselves were of Turkic linguistic heritage. They adopted Manicheism as the state religion in the mid-eighth century, but a century later Kirghiz incursions forced them from their seat of power in Mongolia. Some fled east to China, some west to the Gansu, establishing a small state that lasted until 1028; and still others fled to the Tarim and Turfan. There they set aside Manicheism for Buddhism, and they flourished in a multicultural empire until the thirteenth century.

It is against this rich tapestry of varied ethnicities and languages that we find the Tocharian documents.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following excerpt continues the Tocharian B text B107 (THT 107) from the previous lesson.

We see in line 18 of this selection the use of the subjunctive in a subordinate clause denoting a general characteristic: B se ññissa śpālmeṃ tākaṃ cwi aiścer 'Will you give (them) to him who would be better than me?', or in more colloquial English, 'Will you give them to whoever is better than me?' or '... to someone better than me?' The subjunctive in this context signals that there need not be any specific person in mind: if there is any sage better than Indra, whoever it be, give the alms to him.

Note also in line 18, as well as previously in line 13, the form B weñā-me-ś. We see here the secondary case ending applied to enclitic pronouns. Moreover this provides an illustration of the use of the allative with verbs of speaking to denote the person addressed.

This passage also employs several times the term B ylaiñäkte. This term literally means 'king-god' and is used to refer to the god Indra. The second member of the compound is clearly -ñäkte 'god, divine being', also found in this passage in B Bra(h)m-näkte 'brahma-god'. The first member ultimately derives from the same root as A wäl B walo 'king'. See Section 47 of this lesson for further details.

Translation
17 Indra descended (and) took the guise of a sage (and) those seated under the tree saw him. They brought him the porridge (and) said to him, "Partake of our alms, sage." 18 Suddenly the brahma-god descended (and) a little below he sat in the ashram in splendid manner. Indra, having taken the guise of a sage, said to them: "Sisters, will you give me these alms or will you give (them) to him who would be better than me?" 19 Nanda (and) Nandabala said, "We will give (them) to whoever would be better than you." So Indra motioned to the brahma-god (and) said to them, "Sisters, this sage (here) is better than me; give (them) to him." 20 Rejoicing, they went to the brahma-god (and) worshipped him. Having taken the porridge in their hands they speak to him.
Grammar
46 Indefinite Pronoun
Tocharian possesses an indefinite pronoun A saṃ B ksa 'who-, which-, whatever' or 'who-, which-, whatsoever'. As with its cousins the interrogative and relative pronouns, the indefinite pronoun is mercifully indifferent to distinctions of gender and number. For example, A saṃ B ksa refers to a noun in the nominative, be the referent masculine or feminine (or neither), or be it singular or plural. The following chart lists the full, but brief, set of forms.

Indefinite	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 
N	 	saṃ	 	ksa
G	 	ke	 	ket(a)ra
Obl.	 	caṃ	 	kca
The two Tocharian languages differ slightly in their usage of the pronoun. In Tocharian A, the indefinite typically follows the negative particle (A mā saṃ), a demonstrative (compare Gk. hós-tis), or the pronominal adjective A ālak 'other' (A ālak saṃ 'someone, anyone', similar to Lat. ali-quis 'someone, anyone'). In Tocharian B, the indefinite typically follows a relative or interrogative pronoun (B kuse ksa (nom.), kuce kca (obl.), etc.) or a demonstrative (B su ksa).

The forms of the indefinite in Tocharian pose some difficulties in terms of their historical evolution. In Tocharian A, the situation appears straightforward: the nominative and oblique forms reprise those of the demonstrative, while the genitive is identical to that of the interrogative. The Tocharian B genitive form B ket(a)ra likewise stems from the interrogative, with the addition of a final particle B -ra 'also'. The form B ketra generally appears in poetic language, while B ketara, derived from the accent falling on the anaptyctic vowel PToch *ketärā, generally appears in prose.

The nominative and oblique forms in Tocharian B bear an obvious similarity to the corresponding forms of the interrogative (B kuse, kuce, cf. A kus, kuc), but with a conspicuous difference in final vocalism and a lack of the labial element u of the initial consonants. As a consequence, the origin of these forms remains somewhat obscure. One proposed derivation looks to the PIE antecedent of generalizing phrases such as Lat. quis-quis and Hitt. kuiš-kuiš 'anyone' (Pinault 2008): PIE *kʷi-s kʷi-s. If we recall (Section 41, Lesson 9) that the form *kʷi-s likely reflects a collocation of an interrogative stem *kʷi- and the deictic *so-, then we may suppose an archaic phrase something like *kʷiso kʷiso. If stressed as a unit, we might expect *kʷisó kʷisò. The result in Proto-Tocharian would be PToch *kʷyäsæ kʷyäsæ > *kwäsæ ksæ, with stress on the vowel in boldface. This would further result in *kwäsæ ksæ > *kwäsæ ksā if we assume that the final unaccented vowel evolves along the same lines as the negative particle PIE *meH₁ > *mē > PToch *mæ > AB mā; this would be a rule peculiar to monosyllables (contrast Section 11.5.4, Lesson 3). Such a sequence of changes would finally yield PToch *kwäsæ ksā > B kusé ksà, from which we could imagine that speakers isolated the form ksa and extended it to other contexts.

47 Noun Class VII: the Noun A wäl B walo
Tocharian declension Class VII contains but a single noun: A wäl B walo 'king'. This noun ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *welH- 'be strong'. The paradigm shows two different stems: PToch *wälõ in the nominative singular, *lānt- elsewhere. Even the oblique stem, however, derives from prior *wlānt-, since PToch *w- regularly falls away immediately preceding a liquid. The following chart gives the paradigm, together with the historical evolution of the particular forms.

Class VII	 	A	 	B	 	PToch	 	 	 	PIE
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	wäl	 	walo	 	*wälõ	 	*wälōn	 	*wḷH-ōn(t-s)
G	 	lānt	 	lānte	 	*lāntæ	 	*wlā-ntæ	 	*wlḤ-nt-os
Obl.	 	lānt	 	lānt	 	*lāntä	 	*wlā-ntä	 	*wlḤ-nt-ṃ
Perl.	 	lāntā	 	lāntsa	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	lāṃś	 	lāñc	 	*lāñcä	 	*wlā-nytyä	 	*wlḤ-nt-es
G	 	lāñcäśśi	 	lantaṃts	 	*lāntänsä	 	 	 	 
Obl.	 	lāñcäs	 	lāntäṃ	 	*lāntäns	 	*wlā-ntäns	 	*wlḤ-nt-ṇs
Perl	 	lāñcsā	 	lāntäntsa	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note in the above paradigm that Tocharian A has generalized the palatalized stem *lāñcä proper to the nominative plural to the remaining plural forms.

The nominative forms have provided a major source of scholarly controversy. This arises in part because we final in nominal compounds the forms A wlāṃ- B *yälai-: e.g. A ylai-ñäkte B wlāṃ-ñkät, literally 'king-god', where both elements are generally taken to be nominative singular. To account for the alternation A w- B y-, we suppose the Proto-Tocharian form contained a palatalized *wy-, and so the form likely derives from a full grade of the root: PIE *welH-. Consider the following.

PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	A	 	B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1a. *welḤ-nt(s)	 	*wyälā-n	 	*wyälā́n	 	wlām-	 	*yälái-
1b. *welḤ-ōn(ts)	 	*wyäl-ōn	 	*wyälā́n	 	wlām-	 	*yälái-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2. *welḤ-ōn(ts)	 	*wyäl-ōn	 	*wlõ	 	wäl	 	wlo, wálo
In (1a) we see the development based on the full grade of the root and zero grade of the suffix. Alternatively, in (1b) we may see the suffix as imported from the accusative. As first member of a compound we expect the accent to fall on the second syllable; either development yields the forms we find in composition. Note the typical evolution *-ān(ä) > B -ai in an accented syllable. In (2) we see that, if we admit the full grade of the root, then we must nevertheless have in the Proto-Tocharian period depalatalization of the initial *wy-. This would follow upon deletion of the reduced vowel *ä, leaving in Tocharian B a form wlo. This latter we do in fact find as a common by-form in poetry, alongside the form B wálo with accent on the PToch reduced vowel.

We find derivatives of this word based on the stem *lānt-. In particular, the word for 'queen' follows a straightforward feminine formation: PIE *wlḤ-nt-iH₂ > PToch *wlā-nt-yā > *wlāntsā > A lānts B lāntsa. We also find A lāñci B lantuññe 'royal', among others.

48 Infinitive
Tocharian possesses one infinitive ending, identical in the two languages: AB -tsi. The formation, however, differs slightly between Tocharian A and Tocharian B: Tocharian A appends the infinitive suffix -tsi to the present stem, while Tocharian B applies it to the subjunctive stem. The form remains invariant regardless of voice, active or mediopassive.

Inasmuch as the infinitive is a verbal noun, it may take secondary case endings. In Tocharian A we only find the infinitive with the allative suffix, and rarely at that. Tocharian B is more flexible in this regard, employing the infinitive with case endings for allative, perlative, locative, and even genitive. Consider the following examples:

Allative: A pälskes kāswoneyantu kropnäsiyac ayanisuneyum... ṣrurm 'foundational reason for collecting virtues of the spirit';
Perlative: B eśane klausane ṣeycer-me kartstse yolo lkātsi klyaussisa 'you were our eyes (and) ears for seeing (and) hearing good (and) bad';
Locative: B toṃ ykenta wnolmeṃts nestsine 'these (are) the points in the existence of living beings';
Genitive: B ceu smāṃ yāmtsintse pelkiñ 'for the sake of performing such repetition'.
As the invariable infinitive suffix -tsi does not distinguish voice, the resulting verbal noun may be construed with either an active or mediopassive sense. For example:

A kusne ṣeñc lkātsi wākmtsaṃ krant wramäṃ puk tām pyākṣaṃ 'all those good things (were) on the (offering)post which were to be seen (as) outstanding';
B ṣale tapre murtaṣe olaṅk nai ṅke raṅkatsi 'the high mountain of exaltation (is) surely fit to be climbed'.
The Tocharian languages also employ the infinitive as a predicate. Consider

A pñintwāśśi okoyā lkātsi kāwältune atroñci tampe 'beauty and courageous strength (are) to be seen as the fruit of virtue(s)';
B te päkṣälle śälype lipātsi 'this (is) to be cooked, the fat (is) to remain'.
The infinitive, even though built to the base stem of a verb, may nevertheless occasionally be construed as causative. Take the following examples:

A war wipāsi lywā-ṃ 'she sent him water for wetting', from A wip- 'be wet';
B tumeṃ weña śkamaiyya lānte palsko mrauskatsiś 'then the ten-powered one spoke so as for the king's spirit to tire', i.e. 'then the ten-powered one spoke so as to tire the king's spirit', from B mrausk- 'be tired, feel weary'.
We generally find phonetic changes where the infinitive suffix encounters a root-final sibilant, *-s-tsi > -ssi. When the stem-final sibilant results from the palatalization of one of the present or subjunctive class endings, we find depalatalization: *-ṣṣ(ä)-tsi or *-ṣ(ä)-tsi both yield *-s-tsi > -ssi. In Tocharian B, however, the affricate or palatalization may reappear. We find a similar loss of palatalization, and gemination, with present and subjunctive suffixes -ññä- and -ñä-. Consider the following examples.

PToch	 	AB	 	Example	 	PToch	 	Toch A	 	Toch B	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-s-tsi	 	-ssi	 	 	 	*wäs-tsi	 	 	 	wassi	 	'to put on', also 'clothing'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	wastsi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*næs-tsi	 	 	 	nessi	 	'to be'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	nestsi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-(ṣ)ṣ(ä)-tsi	 	-ssi	 	 	 	*klyæus-yä-tsi	 	klyossi	 	klyaussi	 	'to hear'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	klyauṣtsi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*pāsk-yä-tsi	 	pāssi	 	pāssi	 	'to protect'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	pāṣtsi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	*aisk-yä-tsi	 	essi	 	 	 	'to give'
 	 	 	 	 	 	*kumnäṣä-tsi	 	kumnässi	 	 	 	'to come'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-(ñ)ñ(ä)-tsi	 	-ssi	 	 	 	*tuṅkiññ-tsi	 	tuṅkiñtsi	 	 	 	'to love'
 	 	 	 	 	 	*täṅkwäññ-tsi	 	 	 	tänkwantsi	 	 
As we see in the last example, where Tocharian B shows depalatalization *täṅkwäññ-tsi > B tänkwantsi, Tocharian A occasionally restores the original palatalized nasal: *tuṅkiññ-tsi > A tuṅkiñtsi.

In the written documents, we often find that later texts show a simplification of the infinitive suffix -tsi to -si. For example, for the root śu-/śwā- 'eat' we often find infinitive AB śwāsi instead of the expected AB śwātsi.

The specific origin of the infinitive ending remains somewhat unclear, though the source most likely derives from a PIE nominal formation in an oblique case such as the dative, a sense reflected in English by the to of infinitives such as 'to do' or 'to speak', and analogous to what we find in others of the early IE languages. One common argument takes as starting point a nominal formation in PIE *-ty- with dative ending *-ey; another argument supposes an original *-dʰyōy, where the *-ō- evolves to *-u as found before some finals (cf. Section 11.4.4, Lesson 3), and then the genitive-dative ending *-i is imported from the nominal paradigms during the Proto-Tocharian period. The following chart summarizes the evolution.

PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	A	 	B	 	Comparanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*-ty-éy	 	*-tyäi	 	*-tsäi	 	-tsi	 	-tsi	 	Ved. -taye
*-dʰyōy	 	*-tsu + -i	 	*-tsäi	 	-tsi	 	-tsi	 	Ved. -dʰyai
49 Anomalous Verbs
Certain verbs in Tocharian do not superficially conform to the patterns outlined in previous lessons for the formation of the various tenses and moods. For this reason, we term these verbs 'anomalous', or sometimes 'irregular'. But as we have seen over the past several lessons, the entire process of historical linguistics can be viewed as one whereby the scholar employs seeming irregularities in a language at a given point in time to reconstruct actual regularities which obtained at an earlier point of the same language. This in a nutshell is the process of linguistic reconstruction. Viewed in this light, 'irregular' verbs a no longer truly 'irregular'; they are simply no longer regular. To the linguist, they are precious jewels whose glimmer represents earlier hoards of treasure. Below we unearth some of the more precious treasures concealed within the Tocharian languages.

49.1 Suppletive Verbs
When a particular verb occurs in a language with great frequency, we quickly learn its forms by rote: the continual exposure to the verb allows us to correct our mistakes. For this reason in English we are able to assimilate the forms of the verb 'to be': am, is, are, was, were, be, been. When a verb occurs less frequently, its paradigm often shifts as speakers forget or avoid previous forms and must invent them anew: is the past tense of hang really hung, or is it hanged? Sometimes the process of invention occurs by adopting a pattern current elsewhere in the language. For example, compare OE byrnan, with preterite beorn, to its modern reflex burn, with preterite burned; as the inherited strong preterite (beorn) was eventually replaced by a form (burned) built according to the more prevalent and productive weak preterite paradigm. In other instances, however, where speakers find forms of a certain verb deficient for some reason, often they co-opt forms of another verb with a related meaning. Look for example at the some forms for the present and preterite in Modern (New) English, Old English, German, Latin and Sanskrit as listed in the following chart.

 	 	NE	 	OE	 	German	 	Latin	 	Sanskrit
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	am	 	eom, bēo	 	bin	 	sum	 	asmi
2	 	are	 	eart, bist	 	bist	 	es	 	asi
3	 	is	 	is, biþ	 	ist	 	est	 	asti
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	are	 	sind(on), bēoþ	 	sind	 	sumus	 	smaḥ
2	 	are	 	sind(on), bēoþ	 	seid	 	estis	 	stʰa
3	 	are	 	sind(on), bēoþ	 	sind	 	sunt	 	santi
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Preterite	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	was	 	wæs	 	war	 	eram	 	āsam
2	 	were	 	wære	 	warst	 	eras	 	āsīḥ
3	 	was	 	wæs	 	war	 	erat	 	āsīt
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	were	 	wæron	 	waren	 	eramus	 	āsma
2	 	were	 	wæron	 	wart	 	eratis	 	āsta
3	 	were	 	wæron	 	waren	 	erant	 	āsan
In both Latin and Sanskrit we find full paradigms for the PIE root *H₁es- (*Ø-grade *H₁s-): this yields Lat. es- (Ø-grade s-) and Skt. as- (s-). The lengthened ā- in Sanskrit derives from an additional augment, PIE *(H₁)e- > Skt. a-, coalescing with the initial vowel of the root. But as we see in German and Old English, forms with initial b- have begun to make their presence felt. In fact, at one point in the history of English, evidently there were many available forms for this root. Ultimately this derives from a separate PIE root *bʰuH 'be, become', which invades the Latin paradigm elsewhere (e.g. perfect fuī 'I was'), and which retains a completely independent paradigm in all tenses in Sanskrit (e.g. present bʰavāmi 'I become'). Moreover German and English show importation of yet another root, with initial w-, in the preterite. This ultimately derives from a completely different PIE root *wes- 'dwell, live', preserved in certain Latin nominal forms (e.g. Ves-ta 'goddess of the hearth', astus 'craft (practiced in a town)'), and as a completely independent verbal paradigm in Sanskrit (e.g. vásati 'dwells').

Scholars employ the term suppletion to denote this process of adopting forms from other roots to fill gaps left in the paradigm of a given root. The resulting hodge-podge of forms culled from various roots to correspond to a given meaning is sometimes termed the verbal complex corresponding to that meaning. Thus, in English, 'to be' is a suppletive verb whose verbal complex consists of the forms as, is, are, was, were, be, been, originally spliced together from the three different PIE roots *H₁es-, *wes-, *bʰuH-. The process of suppletion occurs in languages the world over and is not unique to English. What remains unique to a particular language, however, is the particular root or roots affected, and the manner in which the verbal complex is filled out.

Tocharian naturally exhibits the results of suppletion in numerous verbal complexes. The most common situation encountered is one in which two roots combine to fill out the verbal complex corresponding to a certain basic sense or meaning. As we see above with English, where forms divide along the lines of tense, we also find a certain regularity in Tocharian concerning where a given root picks up after another leaves off. Rather than finding a division along the lines of tense, however, we typically find a split along the lines of verbal aspect (see Section 45 of Lesson 9 for a fuller discussion of verbal aspect). In particular, in a Tocharian suppletive verbal complex, one root typically provides forms with imperfective aspect (hence present), while the other provide perfective forms (hence preterite and subjunctive). Thus the most prevalent situation is one in which two roots combine to fill out a given verbal complex. The following list provides the most salient examples.

Meaning	 	Imperfective Stem	 	Perfective Stem
 	 	 	 	 
lead	 	AB āk-	 	AB wā(y)-
stand	 	AB käly-	 	A ṣtäm- B stäm-
sit	 	AB ṣäm-	 	AB läm-
eat	 	AB śu-/śwā-	 	AB tāp(p)-
drink	 	AB yok-	 	AB tsuk-
see	 	AB läk-	 	AB pälk-
We also encounter in Tocharian suppletion of three roots into a single verbal complex. The aspectual split between roots in such instances is not necessarily so clear-cut. The following chart provides examples.

Meaning	 	Present	 	Subjunctive	 	Preterite	 	Imperative
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
give	 	A e-	 	A e-	 	A wäyā-	 	 
 	 	B ai-	 	B ai-	 	B wäyā-	 	B *t(s)-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
carry	 	A pär-	 	A kām-	 	A kām-	 	A kām-
 	 	B pär-	 	B ās-	 	B kām-	 	B ās-
As the above chart shows, the particular interplay between suppletive stems at times differs between Tocharian A and B. Of course Tocharian possesses a number of other important suppletive verbs, corresponding to the senses 'make, do', 'go' (cf. English go, went), and 'be' (cf. English am, is, are, was, were, be, been). We turn to a discussion of each of these below.

49.2 AB yām- 'make, do'
One of the single most common verbal stems in Tocharian is AB yām- 'make, do'. This stem appears only in the preterite and subjunctive in Tocharian A, the remainder of the verbal paradigm being filled by the stems A ya- and A ypa-. In Tocharian B, the stem B yām- occurs throughout the paradigm. The following chart provides the present, imperfect and imperative forms of this verbal complex for both Tocharian A and B.

In part the ubiquity of this verb results from its use in periphrastic denominative formations. That is, Tocharian very often employs the formula noun + yām- 'do (noun)' to derive a verb from a given noun. This parallels the use of the verbal root kṛ- 'do, make' in Sanskrit or kar-nā in Hindi to derive verbs from nouns: e.g. Hindi fon karnā 'to make a (tele)phone call, to call, to phone'. In Tocharian the resulting verb may be transitive or, less frequently, intransitive. The following chart lists some denominative verbs in Tocharian B employing B yām=.

The compound verb noun + yām-, when transitive, typically takes a direct object in the oblique. With some such verbs, however, the object may be in a different case, most typically the genitive.

At present the etymology of AB yām- and the remaining stems in the verbal complex remains obscure. Scholars have proposed various etymologies for the pair ya-, ypa- (Pinault, 2008). We note that the stem ypa- occurs only in those positions in the paradigm where we would expect the PIE thematic vowel *-o- > PToch *-æ-. Given this, the evolution could perhaps follow from either PIE *yew- or PIE *yeH₁- as given below.

 	 	PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	Toch
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1.	 	*yew-o-	 	*yäβæ-	 	*yäpa-	 	ypa-
 	 	*yew-e-	 	*yäwyä-	 	*yäyä-	 	yä-
2.	 	*yeH₁-o-	 	*yäβæ-	 	*yäpa-	 	ypa-
 	 	*yeH₁-e-	 	*yä-ä-	 	 	 	yä-
The root PIE *yew- has the meaning 'hold, draw to oneself, attach', while PIE *(H)yeH₁- means 'throw, put (by throwing)'. Either solution presents its own problems, and there is no shortage of alternate views: for example ypa- may derive from *pi-yeH₁- by metathesis (Adams, 1999). In any of these situations, however, scholars tend to view yām- as deriving from one of the above roots via a process of extension with *-m-, perhaps by analogy with other roots such as *H₂emH₃- 'take hold, seize' (cf. Lat. amā-re) which would also show initial *y- in Tocharian.

49.3 AB i- 'go'
Another verb ubiquitous in the Tocharian languages is AB i- 'go'. Though typically listed in the dictionary under i-, the form *yä- in fact forms the basis for the majority of the paradigm. The following chart provides the present, imperfect and imperative forms.

In Tocharian A the verb i- takes a suppletive stem kälk- in the subjunctive, optative and preterite. Tocharian B, by contrast, shows the suppletive stems mäs- and mit- in the preterite only. The verb AB mit- 'to get started' actually shows a full paradigm -- present, subjunctive and preterite -- in both Tocharian A and Tocharian B. The stem A kälk- may be related to the verb B kalāk- 'follow'. The following chart list the remainder of the paradigm for AB i-: subjunctive, optative and preterite.

Note in the above that the Tocharian B preterite form mas(s)a derives from preterite Class III, whereas the remainder of the preterite forms derive from Class I. Moreover, in Tocharian B the present forms double as subjunctive forms; there is no formal distinction between the two. This extends to the infinitive stem as well.

In Section 24.1, Lesson 5 we already met the present forms of AB i- as an illustration of straightforward athematic present conjugation in PIE and the result in Tocharian. We reprise here the Tocharian forms, together with the corresponding forms in Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. In the two central columns labeled 'PIE', the leftmost provides the likely PIE progenitors of the Tocharian forms, while the rightmost the progenitors of (a majority or indicative sample of) the forms in other sister languages.

We have already seen that the second person singular forms pose difficulties in Tocharian (a possible source would be PIE *H₁i-Ø-tH₂e, with an ending imported from the PIE perfect). Likewise the third person singular forms, which possibly show in their endings the remnants of enclitic particles. We also encounter in Tocharian B a nasal formation: third person plural PIE *H₁i-no-nt > PToch *yänæn > B yaneṃ; similarly in the first person plural. This could perhaps even provide the source of the third person singular of Tocharian B, removing the need to invoke an enclitic particle in this instance. This nasal element also seems to appear in the second person dual imperative in Tocharian A: A pines < PToch *pä-yän-ais. We find this nasal suffixed form of this root preserved in both Latin and Hittite. The imperative likewise presents difficulties: *H₁i-dʰi should yield PToch *yäcä, rather than the *yäṣä required for A piṣ B paṣ. The plural form does seem to correspond, however, with the result in Tocharian A: PIE *H₁ité > PToch *p(ä)-yäcä > A pic.

49.4 A nas- B nes- 'be'
Tocharian possesses a rather idiosyncratic manner of expressing the verb 'to be' if we consider A nas- B nes- 'be' in conjunction with the copula B ste, etc., discussed below in Section 49.4. Even within the paradigm of the verb listed as A nas- B nes- we find a suppletive paradigm. In particular, A nas- B nes- provides the stem solely in the present finite forms. The imperfect forms derive from a stem A ṣe- B ṣai-, while the complete remainder of the paradigm derives from the stem AB tākā-. The following chart lists the present, imperfect and imperative forms.

We note in the Tocharian A imperative forms the appearance of ṣ- preceding the initial t- of the stem. This provides our first clue as to the PIE origin of the stem tāka-. The most likely candidate is PIE *(s)teH₂ 'stand', with *s-mobile, in zero-grade and with the addition of a stem-final *-k- reminiscent of that found in the Greek perfect active: PIE *(s)tH₂-k- > PToch *tāk-. Note we find in the Tocharian A subjunctive an abbreviated stem tā-.

The imperfect stem A ṣe- B ṣai- most probably derives from the optative of PIE *H₁es- 'be'. With zero grade of the root and full grade of the optative suffix, we seem to find a secondary recharacterization with another optative suffix: PIE *H₁s-yeH₁- + -iH₁- > *H₁s-yē-iH₁- > PToch *syæ-yä-, yielding A ṣe- and B ṣai-.

Perhaps most problematic is the present stem: A nas- B nes-. Scholarly opinion remains divided over the ultimate origin of this root (Pinault, 2008; Adams, 1999). Some see the PIE root *nes- 'return home', as seen in Gk. néomai. The Tocharian forms would therefore reflect an original PIE *o-grade *nos-, elsewhere unattested as an athematic present. Others see in this stem the remnants of a locative 'be' verb, where the ubiquitous verb *H₁es- 'be' employs the locatival prefix *H₁eno- 'in', parallel to Gk. én-esti 'is in, is among, is present': we would have PIE *H₁eno-(H₁)s- > PToch *næs- > A nas- B nes-. This requires, however, that the initial laryngeal of the zero-grade root *H₁s- fall away, preventing an evolution *-o-H₁- > *-ō- > PToch *-ā-.

49.5 The Copula
When Tocharianists refer to 'the copula', this refers less frequently to a class of verbs equating subject and predicate, and more often to a specific verb that appears solely in Tocharian B: B ste, star- 'be'. In both Tocharian A and B, one encounters equation of subject and predicated effected by simple juxtaposition, akin to modern English stereotypes of the contact language that arose between Native Americans and pioneers of European descent in the midwest United States: 'This man -- good.' Modern English always requires the use of a form of 'to be' or equivalent verb in such situations, e.g. 'This man is good'; but the Tocharian languages had no such requirement per se. Rather the employment of a verb of existence in such situations derives from other considerations, such as the desire to express

Tense: 'This man was good', as opposed to how he may be perceived today;
Mood: 'Were this man good', making the equality hypothetical;
Enclitic Pronouns: this is more specific to Tocharian. The speaker may wish to express, e.g., the point of reference via a pronoun: 'This man is good from my point of view', or simply 'This man is good to me' (maybe equivalent to English 'This man seems good to me'). In such a situation, the phrase 'to me' will be expressed in Tocharian by an enclitic pronoun bound to a form of the verb.
In each of these three instances, Tocharian A uses the appropriate form of A nas- to provide the copula. Tocharian B, however, differs in that it uses special forms for the copula solely in the present tense; outside of the present, Tocharian B likewise employs the appropriate forms of B nes-. The forms of the so-called copular present are listed in the following chart.

B ste	 	B Pres.	 	B Pres. Suffixed
 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	 	 	 
2	 	star	 	 
3	 	ste	 	star-ñ
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	 	 	 
2	 	 	 	 
3	 	stare, skente	 	stare-me, skentar-ne
As the above chart makes clear, these verb forms rarely appear outside of the third person. Moreover, different forms are employed when the copula is suffixed with an enclitic pronoun.

It will by now come as no surprise that the historical origins of these forms continue to invite scholarly debate (Pinault, 2008). Speakers of Spanish will be happy to know that one look-alike, Sp. estar 'to be', might also provide an etymological cousin: one hypothesis for the PIE origin of the Tocharian B copular present is PIE *steH₂- 'stand', which yields Lat. stare and later Sp. estar. According to this line of argument, the Tocharian forms B ste and stare would derive from the mediopassive forms of the root aorist, as below.

PIE	 	PToch	 	Toch B
 	 	 	 	 
*stH₂-ó	 	*stæ	 	ste
*stH₂-ró	 	*stāræ	 	stare
Note, however, that the shift *-ā- > a of the root vowel suggests the verb form itself would have been enclitic, an atypical situation. From here the forms skente, skentär- are viewed as dialectal innovations.

A second view suggests the copular present forms derive from PIE *H₁es- 'be' (here Spanish speakers may content themselves to know Sp. ser 'to be' would now be the cognate, though that is perhaps less useful as a mnemonic device). In particular, scholars suggest an origin in the zero-grade of this root, augmented by the ubiquitous *-sḱ- suffix in PIE. This parallels Gk. éskon and Lat. escit, escunt. The evolution would be as follows.

PIE	 	PToch	 	 	 	Toch B
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*H₁s-sḱe-to	 	*ṣṣätæ	 	 	 	ste
*H₁s-sḱo-nto	 	*sskæntæ	 	 	 	skente
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
*H₁s-sḱe-tṛ	 	*ṣṣätär	 	*stär-	 	star-
*H₁s-sḱo-ntṛ	 	*sskæntär	 	 	 	skentär
This view has the appeal of deriving all the forms at once, the first two from the PIE injunctive, the second two from the indicative.

Studies have shown (cf. Pinault, 2008, for discussion) that the form stare appears limited to those text found in the easternmost region (Turfan), specifically to texts which are later and popular. The form skente appears to be in more widespread use for the plural throughout the entire region of Tocharian B texts. This prompts a third view (Pinault, 2008), whereby skente remains a form inherited from PIE, but *skæntär > B skentär would arise as a secondary extension of this form modeled on verbs such as B mäsk- 'find oneself, be': *mäskæntär > B mäskentär.

50 Uses of Basic Tenses and Moods
50.1 Tenses
As we have discussed elsewhere (Section 45, Lesson 9), tenses place an action in time relative to the moment of utterance. In that regard, they refer to factual assertions, since those actions actually exist in time. Such statements or assertions are said to be (in the) indicative. Tocharian contains three indicative verbal formations: the present, preterite, and imperfect. We discuss their uses below.

50.1.1 Present

The present tense in Tocharian, naturally enough, represents an action contemporaneous with the moment of utterance. We also find a usage termed the historical present which is familiar to colloquial English. Specifically, a speaker of English when relating past events may opt to employ the present tense: as a stereotypical example (often imagined with a New York accent), "I was working yesterday and these two guys walk up to me and they say... ." We would expect, respectively, the past tense forms walked and said. This particular habit of speech typifies many Indo-European languages, particularly early languages such as Latin and Greek; Tocharian is no exception. Often grammatical accounts motivate this shift to the present tense by suggesting this is a rhetorical technique designed to portray the action as more vivid in the mind of the listener. Alternatively, it may harken back to a possible PIE habit to employ the least-marked verb form whenever a preceding form has made all the relevant information (tense, aspect, etc.) clear (Sihler, 1995). Consider the following examples in Tocharian:

A Bārānasyac yäm 'I am going to Bārānasī'. This translates Skt. Bārānasīm gamiṣyāmi, which contains an unambiguous future tense form, so that the intended sense is clearly 'I will go to Bārānasī'.
B se cisa śpālmeṃ tākaṃ cwi aiskem 'I will give (it) to whomever would be better than you,' that is, 'I will give it to someone better than you.'
Tocharian moreover employs the present tense in prohibitive clauses negated in Tocharian A by mar and in Tocharian B by mā. For example: A mar yat mar yat mar slākkär naṣt yaṃtrācāre 'Don't do (it)! Don't do (it)! Don't be downcast, mechanic!'; B mā traṅko yamas-ne 'Don't commit sin(s)!'

50.1.2 Imperfect

The imperfect tense in Tocharian fulfills two basic functions. The first role played by the imperfect is the marking of a past action with durative aspect. That is, the imperfect denotes an action occurring before the moment of utterance and which is viewed as ongoing, e.g. with no fixed beginning, no fixed end, or some definite span of time between beginning and end. (See Section 45, Lesson 9.) This parallels the English past progressive, as in He was walking home from the store. If we compare the English simple past -- He walked home from the store -- the latter views the action as a complete whole: begun, executed, and terminated. The person mentioned reached home. The former, expressed by was walking, does not have the same interpretation: the person mentioned may not have reached home, i.e. the verbal action as expressed by was walking does not necessarily include the endpoints of the action. The Tocharian imperfect parallels this construction. Consider the following examples:

A proṣmiṃn oko sām tsru ṣät lkāmāṃ śāri lyāk mätsratsi oki mā plāc craṅkäs mā karyā śla tuṅk oki nu räsñā poke paṃ ypamāṃ pontsāṃ kapśiññäṣ omlyi wikṣā pekäntāp 'as if shy, looking slightly downward, she appeared lovely; as if dejected she spoke not a word, she did not laugh; as if with love she extended her arm performing service; from the painter's entire body she cast off heat.' Each of the verbs, marked with italics, displays an imperfect tense form; therefore an English rendering staying closer to the Tocharian would translate 'she continued to appear... she was not saying... she was not laughing... she was extending... she continually cast off...'.
B kälymiṃ läkāṣyeṃ cey kom-pirkomeṃ ipprerne ka ṣ lyakār-ne 'they were looking to the heavens when they caught sight of him in the sky from the east.' Here we see clearly the interplay of imperfective aspect, as marked by the imperfect form läkāṣyeṃ, and perfective aspect, as marked by the simple preterite lyakār: the imperfect denotes an ongoing action within which the perfective or punctual action of the preterite occurs.
The second role played by the imperfect is the marking of past repeated action. That is, the imperfect serves to denote a sequence of individual actions which occurred prior to the moment of utterance. These individual actions may themselves be perfective (instantaneous or complete) or imperfective (ongoing or unfinished); the imperfect has no particular connotation in this regard. An English parallel would be the verb phrase was shooting. The verb shoot itself is lexically perfective or punctual (there is no extended notion of 'shoot'; it is by the nature of the verb an action instantaneously over and done with). The simple past He shot denotes a past occurrence of this action as a complete whole. But when we employ in English the construction he was shooting, the combination of lexical punctuality with morphological durativity forces the listener to understand a sequence of past occurrences of the verb shoot. The Tocharian imperfect fills the analogous role in Tocharian. Consider the following examples:

A tmäṣ ptāñkät käṣṣi... kospreṃnne ṣik tāwiṣ täprenäk sās tkaṃñkät nuṣā kälñā oki kāckeyo 'Whenever the Buddhalord, the Master, would take a step, the Earth would roar (and) bellow as if with joy'. Here A tāwiṣ is an optative form denoting a past general action: hence 'whenever', i.e. on any occasion whatsoever, and hence 'would take'. The verbs A nuṣā and kälñā, by contrast, are imperfect forms: thus the use of 'would' in their English translations. The difference between the two clauses, which the English does not distinguish well formally, is roughly as follows: on any given occasion that the Buddha might have taken a step, an actual, real result on each occasion was that the Earth resounded.
B saim pärmaṅk cī śaiṣṣentse lakle räskre yāmṣiyeñ-c ṣarne paine kärsnoyeñ-c inte kc=eśne tsaknoyeñ-c mahūrtstsana āstäṃ toṃ empalkaicci kärsnoyeñ-c tsarkanoyeñ-c päkṣiyeñ-c āsta lykaśke kautanoñ-c yetse tsäkṣyeñ-c kektseñmeṃ latkanoyeñ-c misa po 'to you, the support and hope of the world, they were doing bitter harm: they were cutting off your hands and feet, when they were also stabbing out your eyes; careless they were cutting from you these diadem-ringed heads; they were torturing and cooking you; they were chopping up fine your bones; they were burning your outer skin; from your body they were cutting off all the flesh'. The context for the quotation concerns the torments which the Buddha had to endure in former lives. For this reason Tocharian employs the imperfect tense: the imperfect naturally connotes iterated past actions, appropriately evoking the repeated occasions in various past lives in which the Buddha suffered such tortures.
50.1.3 Preterite

The Tocharian preterite in many respects parallels the German perfect. The German morphological perfect has developed such that the same phrase Ic+h habe das Mädc+hen gesehen can have either of two possible interpretations: analogous to the English simple past I saw the girl, or analogous to the English perfect I have seen the girl. Tocharian, like German, employs the preterite in both of these senses. The former use embodies a past action with perfective aspect, i.e. a situation viewed as an indivisible whole and completed before the moment of utterance. The latter notion, that of the perfect, generally stands apart from the perfective-imperfective distinction: it denotes an action which occurred in the past but which has 'present relevance'. Often general linguistic references term this state of affairs an anterior. The fact that some part or sense of the past action persists until the moment of utterance leads nicely to an intersection with the notion of a stative formation: simply enough, a stative verb form denotes a state of being, such as be standing or be alive. General scholarly opinion regarding developments within PIE views perfects encountered in daughter languages such as Latin, Greek and Sanskrit as deriving from original statives in PIE: the connection lies in the fact that certain past formations, such as stood (up), imply a logical, naturally associated resulting state, e.g. be standing.

The Tocharian preterite may generally denote any one of the above situations: past perfective, perfect or anterior, stative. Interestingly, the Tocharisches Elementarbuch (Krause & Thomas, 1960-1964) enumerates categories based in part on terms related to the role in discourse. The categories maintain close ties to the past perfective, perfect, and stative. In particular, the past perfective lends itself to the relation of a sequence of past events, hence a narrative use. We also find the Tocharian preterite employed in stage directions: this parallels the English use of the morphological present. That is, English they leave does not denote an event happening contemporaneous with the moment of utterance; rather it denotes a general action: they leave (whenever the going gets tough), they leave (on the first of every month). English naturally employs this "tense" in stage directions inasmuch as these pertain to no specific time, but generally hold true for the life of the play. Tocharian employs the preterite, likely as a result of origins in the PIE stative, in the analogous role. The scholarly term constative denotes those actions, or more generally assertions, which relay information subject to interpretation as true or false. Consider the following examples.

Narrative: A wlāññäktäṣṣ aci yeñc ñäkciñi lāś ... ṣtamar epreraṃ kakälnārr oki ñäkcyās rapeytu ñañwārr oki śāwe kumci 'The king-god (Indra) and the rest of the heavenly kings were going ... they stood in the sky they seemingly sounded heavenly melodies, great drums seemingly bellowed'; B te keklyauṣormeṃ Araṇemiñ lānte pit maiwāte-ne keṃtsa klāya tane orottsa kwasalñeṣṣa weśeñña klyauṣāte 'Upon king Araṇemi's hearing this his gall shook (and) he fell on the ground; then a great lamenting voice was heard'. Here verb forms in boldface are imperfect, in italics preterite.
Constative: A oṅkälmāśśi nātäk ṣokyo nu māski yāmläṃ wram yāmäṣt 'o master of elephants, you have done a thing very difficult to do'; B kauś maitam lyakām mokoṃ protär wes 'We went out (and) saw our older brother.'
Perfect: A wtäk säs svayampār 'this svayaṃvara (election of a husband) has been decided'; B piṅkte meñe āra 'the fifth month has ended.'
Stage Directions: A lcär poñś B lateṃ poñc, both 'they all exit.'
50.2 Moods
Not all utterances contain facts or statements purported to be factual. Some utterances deal with hypothetical assertions, said to be non-indicative. Since these are hypothetical and therefore do not necessarily exist in the real world, it makes little sense to ask whether they definitely precede, follow, or are contemporaneous with the moment of utterance. Tense therefore does not apply in the strict sense. A similar situation applies with direct commands, which to not fall so easily onto the timeline of past, present and future. To handle such utterances Tocharian contains three so-called non-indicative moods: subjunctive, optative, and imperative. We discuss their uses below.

50.2.1 Subjunctive

The subjunctive plays an important role in the Tocharian verbal system. Part of the ubiquity of the subjunctive derives from its use as a simple future tense. Tocharian contains no separate morphological formation for indicative statements concerning the future. We have seen that the present tense may denote future time, but Tocharian also employs the subjunctive without any modal connotations to denote future actions. This likely arises from the historical antecedents of subjunctive forms exhibiting perfective aspect. This use as a pure future occurs in both main clauses and subordinate clauses. Consider the following examples:

A ārkiśoṣṣis sem waste pākär tāt 'You will appear the support and protection of the world';
B weñāre weskeṃ wat te postäṃ weñeṃ 'They said or they say (or) later they will say this'
In subordinate clauses: A kusne nu caṣ märkampalṣi enäṣluneyaṃ sne-ykorñe tāṣ 'he in particular who will be not unmindful in this lawful instruction...'; compare Skt. yo hy asmiṃ dʰarmavinaye apramatto bʰaviṣyati..., with an unambiguous morphological future verb form.
In addition to the above, Tocharian employs the subjunctive as a true non-indicative mood. That is, the subjunctive often represents verbal actions that do not treat of assertions of fact. The subjunctive may denote actions associated with suppositions, exhortions to action, prohibitions -- in general statements of general action (or inaction), not tied to any particular time relative to the moment of utterance. We find the following uses in main clauses:

Expectation & Supposition: Tocharian may employ the subjunctive when the action is not known or asserted to be a fact. For example: A śtwar-wkäṃ kārmetsūnentu kärse ākṣiñlūneyo 'the four-fold Truth they should know through teaching'; B mäkte ṣ teṃ kelu 'how shall I endure this?' or 'how should I endure this?'
Voluntative & Jussive: Tocharian employs the subjunctive as an exhortation to action, parallel to an imperative. For example: A täṣ nātkis kärsor tāṣ 'Let this knowledge be to the man', i.e. 'Let the man have this knowledge'; B spantai käṣṣi weṃ 'Let the trustworthy teacher speak.'
Prohibition: Tocharian may employ the subjunctive to demand that someone not perform a certain action, essentially as a negated imperative. Here we find the subjunctive with A mar B mā. Consider the following examples, where subjunctives are in italics, imperatives in boldface: A lyukrā kakmusāṃ purpār tkaṃ enässi se āpas pācräśśi śaśmunt slyi cam mar katkat ppāṣār pāpṣune paṣṣ el päśśäm talkeyntu pyām yärk krañcäśśi peṃṣār ykoñcäs 'Enjoy the earth come (to you) in succession to command, (my) son. Do not cross this line extended by (our) fathers and ancestors. Protect moral conduct. Give gift(s) (and) administer offerings. Mete out praise to the good (and) admonish the careless.'; B purwar ce pintwāt mā nai ñakta praṅkäs-me 'Enjoy these alms. Do not reject us, o lord!'
The subjunctive also finds employment in subordinate clauses. The clauses often serve to delineate characteristics of a constituent of the main clause, or they might list the presumptive purpose of an action in the main clause. In particular they frequently denote a possible situation which must obtain for a certain real action or outcome to occur, and in this role they serve to denote actions in the subordinate ('if'-) clause of conditional ('if... then') statements. As such conditions outline general circumstances and not factual situations, they typically do not pertain to a specific moment in time. But when the subjunctive is involved, it typically signifies that the condition is to be checked for validity at or after the moment of utterance. Consider the following examples.

Relative Clauses: The subjunctive in a relative clause often serves to denote that the topic does not only pertain to one specific instance or circumstance, but rather holds as a characteristic or general truth. For example: A pkāmār kusne kri tāś-śi 'Take whatever be your will'; B kete ñemtsa yāmäṃ su mā walke nkelyñene yaṃ 'he under whose name he does (it) will in not much time come to ruin.'
Local & Temporal Clauses: The subjunctive appears in subordinate clauses specifying general characteristics of the time or place of occurrence of the main clause. For example: A äntāṃ tkanā ne säm tsmār kärkñäṣ tmäṣṣ aci kroś tkanaṃ lok or oktsiṣṣ-äṃ 'On whatever ground the root should fix, from this springs forth on the earth a wood a kroś wide'; B kos kos plaskau aräñc täñ... tot yam-c ñakta śaranne 'However often I think upon your heart, so often seek I your refuge, o lord.'
Modal Clauses: Certain subordinate clauses make no specific assertion of fact, nor even specify conditions under which the main clause obtains. Rather they serve to qualify some main clause constituent in a subjective manner. For example: A täpreṃ ats pälkäṣ mäṃtne tsekeṣi pekeṣi pat arämpāt tāṣ 'so he appears, as though he were a sculpted or painted figure'; B mäkte yelyitse ku tallāw tākaṃ ... mant källauṣṣi yelyi ... pelaikneṣṣai kektseṃ cwi śwāṃ-ne yṅkauṃ kästwer 'as if he were miserable, worm-ridden dog, ... so the worms of Possession ... eat the righteous body by day (and) by night (for the one attached to possessions).'
Conditional Clauses: Tocharian employs the subjunctive for subordinate clauses specifying conditions that must hold before a subsequent assertion can hold true. In English, these take the form of 'if ..., then ...' statements, and in Tocharian the subordinate ('if'-) clause often takes a subjunctive. For example: A ṣomāp lānt em kuprene cu ālyek yäsluṣ tāke-ñi 'If I were to give you to one king, others would be my enemies'; B kwri war tākaṃ yolmene wināññenträ omp lwāsa laksäṃ warñai 'If water be in a pool, there will animals enjoy fish and more.' As in English, Tocharian may omit the subordinating conjunction: A kapśiṃñāṣas pākäntu pkänt pkänt potka(m) mā ts/aṃ naṣ āñcäm ñomā '(If) I should split apart the parts of the body, here there is not (anything) by the name Self', or with a similar omission of the subordinating conjunction in English, 'Should I split apart..., ... there is not...'; B ceṃ ksa yāmtär appamāt wrocce lupṣtär nraisa '(if) someone does this one wrong, he casts (himself) into a great hell', or 'should someone do this one wrong, ...'.
50.2.2 Optative

The Tocharian optative provides another non-indicative mood. As with the subjunctive, the optative does not represent actions as factual, but rather potential. In independent clauses, if the subjunctive carries a connotation of generality, expectation, and exhortation, the optative by contrast carries the connotation of possibility, wish, and prescription. The speaker typically employs an independent optative (i.e. one in a main clause) to mark a non-factual assertion that she wishes to be true, or not true. Consider the following examples.

Wish: For example: A tärkor kälpimār ṣñi-tsar ptaṅkät yrāṣimār 'Might I obtain permission (and) might I bathe the Buddhalord with my own hand'; B Mitravārgä paiykāmai po cmelane källoymä krentäṃ wāṣmoṃ 'I wrote the Mitravarga. In all births might I obtain good friends.'
General Prescription: For example: A yaläṃ wramm ats skam yāmiṣ mā yaläṃ wram mar yāmiṣ '(One) should always do the thing to be done; (one) should not do the thing not to be done'; B lāre yamītär waṣamoṃ krento '(One) should hold dear a good friend', with Sanskrit bʰajeta mitraṃ kalyāṇam likewise showing the optative.
Possibility: For example: A kyal mā näṣ penu cami ṣñi amok lkātsi āyim 'why should I too not permit him to see my art?'; B gaje kʰarempa proskai-ywarwecce palskalñe ṣarpi 'an elephant with a donkey might indicate thinking based on fear'. As an example of an irreal, or contrary-to-fact, usage: B toṃ mā tākoṃ śaiṣṣene mā ṅke tsaṅkoy pudñäkte 'were these (old age, sickness, death) not in the world, then the Buddhalord would not arise.'
Unlike the subjunctive, the optative has no generally agreed upon indicative use. At times however the distinction between an optative and an imperfect can become somewhat blurred, as in English (cf. Section 50.1.2 above).

Tocharian also employs the optative in subordinate clauses. Succinctly, these uses parallel those of the subjunctive, but with regard to an imagined time frame of applicability preceding the moment of utterance. That is, they refer to possible or general assertions which might have been true prior to utterance. In this regard, the decision to employ subjunctive or optative in a subordinate clause often rests on the time frame delineated by the verb of the main clause: what would have been a subjunctive subordinate clause with a present time frame in the main clause will often be rendered by an optative subordinate clause when the main clause shifts to a past time frame. Consider the following examples.

Relative Clauses: For example: A kus säm tākiṣ mnu lutäsmāṃ enāk wrasom kusne m=ākāl puttiśparnac skam rititrä 'What a confused, cruel being that must be, that would never foster a desire for Buddhahood'; here the main clause contains an optative, triggering use of an optative in the subordinate clause. Also B kuse parśi-ne ksa tuk sū weṣy entwe 'whoever would ask him, he was always saying the same thing', where the main clause refers to past time.
Local & Temporal Clauses: For example: A tmäṣ ptāñkät käṣṣi... kospreṃnne ṣik tāwiṣ täprenäk sās tkaṃñkät nuṣā kälñā oki kāckeyo 'Whenever the Buddhalord, the Master, would take a step, the Earth would roar (and) bellow as if with joy', noting again that the main clause refers to past time (cf. discussion in Section 50.1.2 above). Also B ponta tärya cmelane mänta ike nesäṃ su ente āñu takoy nta sportomāne saṃsārne 'In all three lives there is absolutely no place in which there would somehow be motionlessness in the revolving saṃsāra'.
Modal & Final Clauses: For example: A polkātsāñ mäṃtne ṣītsrāk tsāśinträ... 'as if lightning bolts were to strike at once', where this denotes an event that is possible, but not occurring, and moreover unlikely to occur. Cf. the Conditional Clauses below. Also B yene saim pyamttsait ... krentä pelaikne mäkte ma ṣäp tsrelyeṣṣe tsśiträ cewak puwarne 'Make, you two, the good dʰarma a refuge so that (one) should not burn in this fire of separation.'
Conditional Clauses: When the condition refers to situations that are specifically contrary-to-fact, i.e. did not, would not, should not happen, etc., Tocharian often employs the optative. For example: A kuprene āṣānik āṣāṃ tākiṣ näṣ-wäknum parnoṃtsāṃ ... tñi kapśañi tsinātsi tärkor kälpimār 'If, o praiseworthy one, (someone) were fitting, like myself, to touch your dignified body, I would obtain permission.' Similarly B pañäktentse procer Nande ñem krui sāṅne yapi sklokacci ṣamāni ywārc mäskīyenträ 'Whenever the Buddhalord's brother, Nanda by name, would enter the saṃgʰa, there would be doubtful monks therein'. As in conditions with the subjunctive, Tocharian may omit the subordinating conjunction: B snai preṅke takoy sa kenä ... eśnesa meṅkitse tākoy kacāp ... pyorye ṣäp tākoy cew warne ... känte pikwala epiṅkte kaccap su no tälaṣṣi aśco rämoytä(r) rmer ka cpi aśce lyautaiyne tāu sälkoytär kewcä tusa amāskai lwasāmeṃ onolmeṃtsä yśamna emetsi 'Were this earth without an island ..., were the tortoise lacking two eyes ..., were there a yoke in the water ..., for a hundred years were then the tortoise to lift his head (and) were his head quickly to bow in the opening (and) were he to pull it upwards, more difficult than this (is it) for living beings to be born from animals among men.'
50.2.3 Imperative

Tocharian employs the imperative in direct commands, as with English Do it!, Get out!, Break a leg!. (Note however the usage with the present tense outlined in Section 50.1.1 above.) Both languages employ the imperative in the second person, singular and plural (Section 44, Lesson 9). Moreover Tocharian B employs a dual form in the second person mediopassive. Though Tocharian usage of the imperative departs little from expectations one would have based on similarities with English or other Indo-European languages, we do nevertheless find a couple idiosyncrasies with a typical Tocharian flair:

Adhortative: We actually find the Tocharian second person plural imperative employed where one might otherwise expect a first person plural subjunctive or present for the purpose of expressing a first-person command. For example: A tämyo wäs ṣñi ype rinäsmāṃ ... ālu ype pic poś träṅki tämne pyāmäs 'Therefore, leaving our land, let us go to the land of others. They all say: then let (us) do (it)!'; B carit päs pyāmtso 'Let's cease (?) with the service'.
Causative: We occasionally find with the imperative a use of the base form of the verb in the sense of a causative. For example: A pkanā-ñy ākāl 'Grant my wish!'; B pwārṣṣe dʰātumpa pätrīwa-ne 'Mix it with the fire-element'.

A Clinic on Looking Up Tocharian Words
Let's assume you have gotten enough Tocharian under your belt that you're ready to move on to other texts. Chances are, you're reading a Tocharian B text; so you place a document with the text on your desk, and beside it your steady companion, the venerable Dictionary of Tocharian B by Douglas Q. Adams. As you read, you come across the word B kelu. You have no recollection of this word, so you look it up in your dictionary. Interestingly, you find there is no listing for kelu, not even a hint like the helpful 'q.v. ...' telling you where else you might look. Nothing. All you find in the near void of kel... entries is a word for 'bellybutton' and some term for 'a medical ingredient'. Neither of these has a chance of giving you kelu, so you may wonder if it was really worth all the trouble learning this esoteric language in the first place. Now what? Search page by page through the section on k? Do you realize how many words start with k in Tocharian? No...

Your only sensible option is to devise some way of cutting down your work and honing in on some realistic possibilities. How to proceed? First, consider what you do know: kelu is not a headword. That is, it is not an adverb; it is not the nominative singular of a substantive; and it is not a verb form transparently displaying the basic verbal root from which it derives. So it must be some other inflected form: either a non-nominative case form, or one of the many possible conjugational forms of a verbal root. At this point, you may as well guess. The final -u of kelu reminds you of the preterite participle, and so you guess that what you're confronted with is a verb form -- maybe even a preterite participle, if you're lucky. But from what verb?

This is where the extra time you spent learning Tocharian in light of historical linguistics finally pays off. You reason as follows: the initial k- is probably part of the root, since there are few changes in Tocharian that will actually produce a k- from some other sound. The same reasoning might convince you that the -l- should be in the root as well, unless this is a gerundive; but if it were, you'd be at a loss to explain the final -u as an ending. So you decide that the root is something like k-l-: that is, maybe there's something between the k- and the -l-, but maybe not; perhaps something comes after... You'll simply remain non-committal. What could sit between the k- and the -l-?

To answer this, you ask yourself a simple question: what produces -e- in Tocharian B? You recall PToch *æ, of course! But that just begs the question: what produces PToch *æ? There you have two options: PIE *ē or PIE *o. How do you decide? Well, suppose the -e- in kelu came from PIE *ē. Then the evolution PIE *ē > PToch *yæ means that the k- should be palatalized, which it obviously is not. So the -e- you see before you most likely comes from PIE *-o-, and you can safely assume that you're trying to find the verb to which a form like PIE *kol- would fit somewhere in the paradigm. But where would that crop up?

Well, you've already assumed you're looking at a verbal root, and *kol- looks like a good candidate for PIE o-grade. The other major forms should derive from either PIE e-grade or PIE 0-grade. One of those probably yields the Tocharian form of the root you're looking for. But which? Well, if it were PIE e-grade, you'd have to consider the evolution of *kel-, and you immediately realize that *-e- will palatalize the *k-, and you shouldn't be looking under k at all. But if you had PIE 0-grade, then you'd have PIE *kl- > PToch *käl- > B käl-.

So armed with your new guess, B käl-, you return to Adams' dictionary, only to find there are two distinct roots with that shape. But, happily, under the first one you chance upon the form kelu as the first person singular active of the CLASS i subjunctive. Did you say subjunctive? CLASS i? You should've known! You figured it was PIE o-grade, after all, and that fits exactly with the development of subjunctive CLASS i. But whatever, you've found it! ... and all as a result of the techniques of historical linguistics that seemed like such hocus pocus until now....

As an added hint, realize that you don't have to follow through the process flawlessly for it to be helpful. For example, who's to say at the beginning of our discussion that we shouldn't have guessed the Tocharian B k- came from an original PIE *g-? Fine, go with it. You would follow the same procedure as above, looking at different grades of a PIE root *gel- (?); but in the end, when it comes back down into Tocharian in the PIE 0-grade, that *g- will still become k-, and you'll still get to the dictionary entry for B käl-. (In fact, Adams lists *kʷel- as the original PIE parent of the verb we're looking at.) Or you might guess some other consonant and different vowel grade -- that's fine, since even following all the different vowel grades of three or four PIE roots (allowing for different sources for the initial consonant) will still leave you with less work than trying to read through the entire k-section of the dictionary entry by entry. So may you enjoy your newfound understanding of Tocharian, and may your knowledge of basic historical linguistics keep you in good stead.

Chrestomathie tokharienne: textes et grammaire, by Georges-Jean Pinault; Peeters, Leuven, 2008. This work provides perhaps the best current single source for the learning of Tocharian by those who read French. As the title suggests, this book provides numerous text selections with accompanying translations and notes. The range of texts admirably provides a picture of the variety of genres that we find in Tocharian. The second half of the work is devoted to a rather full treatment of Tocharian grammar. Truly an exceptional work by one of the great masters of the field.

Institutiones Linguae Tocharicae, Pars II: Chrestomathia Tocharica, by Pavel Poucha; Státní Pedagogické Nakladatelství, Prague, 1956. A slender volume with text selections to accompany the Thesaurus. See below.

Tocharisches Elementarbuch, Band II: Texte und Glossar, by Werner Thomas; Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, Heidelberg, 1964. The gold standard for textual editions accessible to the learner prior to the publication of Pinault's Chrestomathie. This includes a range of texts from both Tocharian A and B, as well as an extensive glossary that, in and of itself, provides a superbly handy tool. This is the second volume of the Tocharisches Elementarbuch; for the first volume, see below.

Grammars
Tocharisches Elementarbuch, Band I: Grammatik, by Wolfgang Krause and Werner Thomas; Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, Heidelberg, 1960. For decades the only authoritative grammar to treat all aspects of both Tocharian A and B. Still an unparalleled resource for the Tocharian scholar. This first volume treats only grammar; the second volume (see above) provides texts and a glossary keyed to the grammar. In the words of Pinault: "The Elementarbuch is not elementary."

Dictionaries
A Dictionary of Tocharian B, by Douglas Q. Adams; Rodopi, Amsterdam, 1999. Simply the gold standard of Tocharian dictionaries. Dedicated solely to Tocharian B, but inasmuch as it is an etymological dictionary it also treats related roots from Tocharian A when a cognate is available. Many of the entries are scholarly articles in themselves. The budding Tocharianist simply cannot do without this reference.

Institutiones Linguae Tocharicae, Pars I: Thesaurus Linguae Tocharicae Dialecti A, by Pavel Poucha; Státní Pedagogické Nakladatelství, Prague, 1955. Until recently the only full dictionary dedicated to Tocharian A. A marvelous work replete with citations and even etymologies, though many of these are outdated.

Lexique Étymologique des Dialectes Tokhariens, by A. J. van Windekens; Bureaux de Muséon, Louvain, 1941. One of the early great etymological dictionaries. Still useful, though some of the etymologies require updating.

Tocharian Linguistic History
Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology, by Douglas Q. Adams; American Oriental Society, New Haven, 1988. An authoritative treatment of the historical evolution of the Tocharian languages. Not meant to be a synchronic grammar of the language. The introduction provides a clear and concise overview of the relevant structures of Proto-Indo-European, so that the text serves as an introduction to Tocharian historical linguistics for those not specializing in either Tocharian or PIE. Some of the details of the historical phonology and morphology differ from the roughly contemporaneous Introduction au Tokharien, and progress has been made in the field since their publication.

Untersuchungen zu den sigmatischen Präsensstammbildungen des Tocharischen, by Olav Hackstein; Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1995. A detailed discussion of the so-called sigmatic present formation in Tocharian, a grammatical feature that stands out from the rest of the Indo-European languages since the marker generally appears elsewhere only in past formations. This work provides insights not only into this formation, but into the entire Tocharian verbal system.

Introduction au Tokharien, by Georges-Jean Pinault; in LALIES: Actes des sessions de linguistique et de littérature, 11; Presses de L'École Normale Supérieure, Paris, 1992. A truly excellent overview of both Tocharian A and B, treating the historical evolution of the languages. Includes a reading selection from each of the two languages. Much of the grammatical material has been updated and included in the Chrestomathie above.

On the Chronology of Sound Changes in Tocharian, Volume 1: From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Tocharian, by Don Ringe, Jr.; American Oriental Society, New Haven, 1996. An effort to piece together what must have been the sequence of sound changes that led to the Tocharian languages.

Le Tokharien confronté avec les autres langues indo-européennes, Volume II: La morphologie verbale, by A. J. van Windekens; Centre International de Dialectologie Générale, Louvain, 1982. An important study of the historical linguistics of Tocharian. Part of the series including the Lexique Étymologique above.

"Tocharian," by Werner Winter, in The Indo-European Languages, ed. Ramat & Ramat. A very brief, but instructive overview of Tocharian. A valuable resource as one studies other more lengthy treatments of Tocharian, to make sure one does see the forest for the trees.

Indo-European Linguistic History
Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction, by James Clackson; Cambridge University Press, New York, 2007. A truly brilliant introduction to the field of Indo-European linguistics. Among similar works, it is brief, but with a clarity that far surpasses most others. The most noteworthy feature is the author's ability to provide an evenly-balanced overview of the theoretical issues at play, without falling prey to entrenchment in one particular scholarly camp or other. In this regard the discussion of syntax, often absent or nearly so in other works for a similar audience, stands out as a must-read.

Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction, by Benjamin W. Fortson IV; Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, 2004. An outstanding introduction to Indo-European linguistics. The first half is dedicated to an overview of the grammar of PIE. The second half is a truly remarkable overview of the specifics of each branch of the Indo-European family, replete with short textual examples and notes. The only small blemish on an otherwise stellar work is the rather brief treatment of syntax.

"A Preface to Diachronic Syntactic Investigation," by Winfred P. Lehmann, in Steever et al. (1976), 169-178. One of the fundamental papers outlining approaches to diachronic syntax in terms of modern syntactic theory and typology.

Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics, by Winfred P. Lehmann; Routledge, New York, 1993. A necessary addition to the bookshelf of any would-be Indo-Europeanist. The first half of the book provides a detailed discussion of the evolution of the discipline itself, which one is hard-pressed to find elsewhere. For those who do not have access to Brugmann's Grundriss, this provides an excellent overview of its placement within the discipline. The second half delves into a discussion of the specifics of reconstructed Proto-Indo-European, as well as a chapter on Pre-Indo-European.

The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World, by J. P. Mallory and D. Q. Adams; Oxford University Press, New York, 2006. A fun, yet scholarly read. This work requires no specialized knowledge of Indo-European linguistics, nor even historical linguistics in general. The early material explains the necessary linguistic concepts and relations among the Indo-European languages, making the book accessible to linguists, archaeologists, and interested readers alike. The remainder of the book is a discussion of Indo-European cognates groups thematically: e.g. family and kinship terms, anatomy, food and drink, space and time, etc. A worthy successor to Buck's A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages.

The Indo-European Languages, edited by Anna Giacalone Ramat and Paolo Ramat; Routledge, New York, 1998. A collection of articles by renowned scholars covering the major branches of Indo-European.

New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin, by Andrew L. Sihler; Oxford University Press, New York, 1995. A truly elegant revision of Buck's original work. Authoritative and innovative in several aspects, and a necessary addition to the library not only of scholars of Greek and Latin, but of Indo-Europeanists in general. The frustrating lack of a thematic index is only partially compensated for by a rather explicit table of contents.

Papers from the Parasession on Diachronic Syntax, April 22, 1976, edited by Sanford B. Steever, Carol A. Walker and Salikoko S. Mufwene; Chicago Linguistic Society, Chicago, 1976. A collection of papers from a conference that many of us dearly wish we could have attended.

"Towards Proto-Indo-European Syntax: Problems and Pseudo-Problems," by Calvert Watkins, in Steever et al. (1976), 305-326. The ultimate well-spring for much of the method of Indo-European poetic reconstruction. The beginning of the paper dedicates itself to a rather stern, bordering on dismissive, rebuke of the methods of syntactic reconstruction outlined in papers by Lehmann and others in the same volume. The remainder of the paper cannot be so dismissed, however, as we see one of the initial glimpses of a method of syntactic reconstruction that has truly turned the discipline on its head.

History & Culture
The Heritage of Central Asia: From Antiquity to the Turkish Expansion, by Richard N. Frye; Markus Wiener Publishers, Princeton, 1996. A truly fascinating account of Central Asia by a scholar who spent most of his life living and breathing Central Asian culture firsthand.

The Prehistory of the Silk Road, by E. E. Kuzmina; University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 2008. An authoritative and up-to-date account of the archaeology of Central Asia and the prehistoric cultures feeding into the region. Some of the work is dedicated to the question of Tocharian migration.

The Tarim Mummies: Ancient China and the Mystery of the Earliest Peoples from the West, by J. P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair; Thames & Hudson, London, 2000. Simply put, this book is fantastic. The scholarship is first rate. The authors take great pains to place the Tarim mummies in their historical context; to achieve this, the book treats historical accounts of Central Asia from both the European and Far Eastern perspectives. Likewise the authors naturally discuss wider archaeological issues concerning various cultures feeding into the region and particularly the problems that surround the location of the so-called Proto-Indo European Homeland. Finally, they treat the linguistic landscape, providing an overview of the various tongues and scripts found in the Tarim Basin and surrounding regions. Few works treat the topic with such authority from such a diversity of angles. Even better, they add humor, with section titles such as "A Brief History of Twine" and "Time to Die?"

The History of the Central Asian Republics, by Peter L. Roudik; Greenwood Press, Westwood, Connecticut, 2007. A work more focused on the modern history of Central Asia, but with a brief and informative introduction to the ancient history.

Buddhism
Buddhism: A Short History, by Edward Conze; Oneworld, Oxford, 1993. A straightforward, scholarly, readable account of the history of Buddhism. Admirable in the way it clearly states what is known and what is not about the early history of the religion, what is conjecture, and what the fundamental issues were in the progression of the philosophy surrounding Buddhism.

Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions, edited by Wendy Doniger et al.; Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., London, 2006. A vast resource for religions of all varieties, with numerous key articles written by renowned scholars.

The Buddhacarita, or, Acts of the Buddha, by E. H. Johnson; Motilal Banarsidass, 1984. For many years the standard scholarly edition in Sanskrit of As'vaghos.a's account of the life of the Buddha.

Encyclopedia of Buddhism, by Edward A. Irons; Facts on File, New York, 2008. A useful collection of information specifically concerning the Buddhist religion.
