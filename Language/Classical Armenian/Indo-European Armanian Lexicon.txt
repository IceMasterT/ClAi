Acknowledgements
I am deeply grateful to my Director of Studies Prof. Dr. Jane Grant for her
inspiring and generous support throughout my research and the writing process. I am also indebted to Prof. Roy Ascott and Prof. Mike Phillips for their
challenging questions and profound encouragement—even though I often
couldn’t provide answers to their questions when they were asked (my brain
is a deer in headlights), they never failed to guide my work.
Being a PhD­student at the Planetary Collegium was an incredible and
formative experience. I want to thank my fellow researchers for their thorough questions (often noted on little pieces of paper—they still keep turning
up in coat pockets and notebooks, and still read “Q for R”) and continuous
interest in my work. In particular, I’d like to thank Julia Heurling, Paola
Lopreiato, Alejandro Quinteros, Seth Riskin, and André Sier for being the
best company I could possibly have wished for on my Journey to Alice.
I want to thank Prof. Dr. Tom Palaima (University of Texas) for welcoming
me as a visiting scholar in the Alice Kober Archive at PASP, and for dedicating his time and enthusiasm to my project. Without him and his trust in my
work, this research wouldn’t exist. I also want to thank Garrett Bruner for
his support, and Cassie Donnelly for her valuable insights into both the
Kober/Daniel correspondence and the Linear B tablets. Y’all are amazing!
As a supporter from very early on, I’m indebted to Dr. Marie Caffari and the
Swiss Literature Institute in Biel for creating an environment in which this
research could unfold and gain momentum.
To my friends and my family, I feel I owe an apology rather than a thank
you (well, both)—you had to do without me quite a lot, especially over the
last two years. Thank you all for always being there for me, at odd hours or
in between flights and trains, for being a stable when I needed one, for your
comprehension and patience—I couldn’t have done it without you.

Abstract
Deciphering the Silence: A Literary Journey to Alice E. Kober
by Regina Dürig
On Thursday, 28 September 2017, I embarked upon my Journey to Alice
Kober: 48 hours in trains taking me from New York City, where she had
lived all her life, to Austin, Texas, where everything that she left behind is
stored today. 48 hours of shades of green and mustardy yellow, 48 hours of
train whistles, drip coffee and blunt panic attacks from being tucked away
under the plastic roof of the compartment at night. 48 hours of hope and
expectations regarding the archive material, of finding what has been lost.
My journey to Alice Kober’s archive, to her still­existing traces, to her
home, but also to her as a character, as an obsession, as an idea which is the
setting and material for this project, which circles around the in­between,
the absent present, and explores writing in the conditions of silence.
My research is a literary exploration of American classicist Alice
Kober’s archive. Literary in the sense of embracing fabulatory strategies, of
working within language rather than using language as an instrument (cf.
Barthes: From Literature to Science). I propose silence and the space to
disappear as method­metaphors of writing, thinking and teaching writing
within language, based on Foucault’s concept of Heterotopia and the
Oulipian conception of constrained writing.
I am a writer with an extensive artistic practice and I think and write,
including when doing research, with my writer’s body. This is to say, I
follow my hand to examine Barthes’ juxtaposition of the bodies of literature
and science, which are, roughly, represented by Alice Kober and myself. I
will, in writing, inhabit her ever­so­distant body to experience what cannot
be known. Revisiting the available documents with artistic means is, given
the limitations in source material, a consequential approach to deepening
our knowledge about Alice Kober.
──
7
To substantiate the importance of not­knowing and partial, local
narratives, I draw on poststructuralist and feminist theories which also feed
into my poetics of absence. I discuss the idea of writing within language
from different perspectives, including writing projects I have realised during
the research process. By exploring Alice Kober’s life in a collection of prose
fragments featuring unpublished excerpts from her correspondence, I strive
to foster creative writing as a method in artistic research, celebrating Luce
Irigaray’s idea of silence as the first word that we speak to each other.

“She wasn’t there, so I had to invent her.”
Anne Carson
You were there, and yet I strived to invent you. I was there and yet I had
to invent me, word by word. The work on this thesis has been a journey
more than anything. Quite literally, as I went to New York (USA), to Austin
(USA), to Stuttgart (Germany), and to London (UK) to do my research and
write. But also metaphorically, very much so, as the original idea of writing
you back into the world soon slivered in my hands, into my thoughts and
took me to projects I would have never imagined. All of them have circled
around different consistencies of silence, of finding a language of some sort.
A language that can tell what can’t be told.

Your fear, Alice, was being led in circles by invalid assumptions without
knowing it. Your unease with all sorts of latency or voids. I know it, too: if I
have to climb a flight of open stairs. My certainty as a child (and still, today,
my suspicion): that I will blunder into the gaping stair boards with one
wrong step, and from there fall all the way down right into the idle stacks of
boxes or home accessories. I take your hand, Alice, and we jump off, and
while we fall, we have time to take a good look at everything. I see nothing.
I read every single letter, every paper, every notebook in your archive, and
there are many in those cramped three rooms in the basement of the classics
building. I know everything about you as a scholar, but still so very little
about you as a daughter, a friend, a woman. I know you were very close to
being appointed professor at Penn. I know you brailled the exam papers for
the blind students at Brooklyn College, where you worked. I know you sent
coffee, sweets and oranges to Johannes Sundwall in Sweden in the years
after the war. I know you strived to create a research centre for Minoan languages to facilitate access to the little Linear B script material that existed,
and to foster exchange among the researchers. I get the sense of a kind, generous and spirited woman, but only between the lines, the type.
You let go of my hand for a moment and our fingers intertwine. It was of
no value, you say. My fingertips on the back of your hand. I knew that I’d
have to invent things in order to write you back into the world. But I didn’t
anticipate that I would feel childish compared to your determination and
your unquestionably brilliant mind. You: meticulous lines with the finest
pen, I: a set of crayons. Our fall velocity decreases.
Over a whole month of intense reading, opening archival boxes, talking
to the experts I didn’t find a single comment or thought that wasn’t meant to
be there: no glimpse, no glitch. No accidents, no re­used paper with unintentional words on the reverse side, no slippage. But on my last day in the
archive, in the last drawer I pulled it out: a little ring binder.
──
13
In it was Hittite homework, probably from 1941. On one of the last
pages, you wrote in German and in pencil: “When grass has grown over all
the good things, for sure some camel comes along to eat it all away.” It is a
slightly skewed version of a line attributed to the 19th century author Wilhelm Busch—in which in the original grass has grown over “a bad thing”
not “all good things”, as you put it.
quite significant: The Collected Stories of Wilhelm Busch was the only
book (a big, red volume) my dad would read to us on the rare occasions that
he was at home in the evening and took the time to be with us (I think the
rather harsh sense of humour in Busch’s stories was how he himself made
sense of the world, the bitter taste of consequences’ cavalcades was what he
wanted us to understand), my brother was always the one allowed to stick
his little index finger randomly between two of the many pages to choose
──
14
our bedtime story: the raven and the wine, the bed full of May beetles, the
twin rascals processed into flour.
“Let grass grow over something” is a German saying equivalent to “time
heals all wounds”, so the Busch quote is all about some troublemaker stirring up what should have been left in peace. The camel, enchanté, that’s me.
I looked around in the dim archive room: yes, I looked up, not to but
beyond the ceiling panels. Heaven and afterlife in a symmetric pattern of
pale fibre squares, gravely convinced that you were addressing me, that you
had found a way to disclose your disapproval of me standing there, having
touched many of your residues for the very first time, as it seemed, because
most of them are still not catalogued or digitised, sit in their dressers, drawers and boxes, just the way your mother gave them to the museum in
Pennsylvania (see letter from Katharina Kober to JS, 23 August 1950, PASP,
Box 58). I was probably the first person to read your letters in German,
sharing the same mother tongue. “But I am on your side”, I wanted to say, “I
am not going to nibble away what was good. On the contrary, I want to keep
it, make it grow.” For a long time, this find was unsettling for me. The friction that it provoked provided the energy for this work. A project in which
silence became writing. In this proposition I am as determined as you were.
This is why I’d like to think that you would, after all, understand my work,
or maybe even approve.
Or was it not all about you discrediting me, but trying to shoo me away?
You died young, at 43, in the middle of your deciphering work. Literally, in
the middle of it: I found an index card you had cut from a letter you had received, written on 8 May 1950. You died a mere eight days later, after having suffered for nearly two years, after a self­imposed diet, after surgery. It
is said it was a gastric carcinoma, despite being weak and in pain you kept
working on the problem of Linear B until there was no energy left. You
went, and Michael Ventris, who solved the riddle in 1952, died four years
──
15
later in a car crash aged 34. Franklin Daniel died at 38 in a car in Turkey,
looking for a new excavation site.
I looked up beyond the ceiling panels, but up there was only one of these
bland fluorescent tubes, suspended, without the slightest glint. No warning.
No curse. The drawer’s metallic sigh when I closed it, as high­pitched as unforgiving. I was convinced—a part of me still is—that what your sentence
commented on was my methods more than the imminent end of my life, because, in fact, it was you who found me, it was you who stirred me up.
I can’t remember in which book I came across the footnote that mentioned the Linear B script. All I know is that it was in the first year of my research, and I think it must have been either in a commentary on Wittgenstein—the link between Linear B and his thoughts is rather adventurous,
though—or in a book about Eros. Back then, my research topic was Love &
Ghosts—A Literary Exploration of the Space in Between as a Place of
Meeting the Other, and despite my honest efforts to narrow down what I
was interested in (language, writing, the ghostly, the absent present) I was
overwhelmed by all sorts of ideas, feedback and references. The book about
Eros demonstrated how he had not been one of the original Olympian Gods
but a late addendum, a sequel to human longing, pain and misery. Amidst all
that, possibly, was the footnote about Linear B. I wondered how a script
called Linear B might look like. I imagined stave or cursive, many little
lines, neatly stacked in any case. I Googled it and found, after following
some links, your story. What struck me the most was your dedication and
obsession for your work, for the decipherment. But also, I found language
and scripts. Daughterhood, womanhood in a male world. Lacking. Insisting.
Traveling. Losing against time.
By the way, you are perfectly right, I am a camel. I am interested in the
decipherment as a backdrop or reality for your story, but I cannot read Lin­

ear B, I can only follow the basic lines of the intellectual efforts which eventually led to the realisation that it was ancient Greek, which was written in a
mostly syllabic script. I am a camel that doesn’t know any Greek: just,
vaguely, Latin. I do not want to expose, though, what should be kept
covered, overgrown, hidden. I feel a very strong responsibility towards you,
your achievements and your life. I had never worked on a project like this
one: a writing project based on an authentic story which I want to honour in
my text. As intriguing as it was to imagine the text, what it might look like
in the end, it was also incredibly hard to write, to get started with writing.
The reason for this restraint is exactly what I am interested in: the absent
present. You are not all that absent: after all, you sit there, across from me,
carefully stirring half a teaspoon of sugar in your black tea. Now that you
have died, you don’t suffer from pain anymore, you don’t have to diet, your
strength has returned.
You aren’t comfortable on my faux­leather easy chair, because the seat
is too low and too wide. Your thighs point up slightly and your woollen skirt
feels like it is sliding down. You wish you’d worn flat shoes, and, who
would have thought, trousers. You think that I am wasting your time, but
you are too polite to say so out loud. But your eyes do, the softness of the
skin beneath them does.
You have to know: I am quite good at observing, noticing, seeing
through surfaces. Maybe this is my only ability, or at least the only one I
have mastered. In my writing, I am very much aware of the world and its inhabitants: to me, writing is all about the creation of spaces. Let me assure
you that this text will explain and argue for its form and tone and right and
relevance. As a camel, I am aware that this is a balancing act, especially for
an even­toed ungulate, but as a writer I have to take the risk. Trust me.
You don’t know where to direct your gaze. You break the butter cookie
in two halves by lifting one side from the plate and pushing down your
thumb. You put the piece in your mouth, drink a sip of tea, use the moisture
to let pastry melt on your tongue, and you swallow silently.

Introduction—Journey to Alice
──
18
On Thursday, 28 September 2017, I embarked upon my Journey to Alice
Kober: 48 hours in trains taking me from New York City, where she had
lived all her life, to Austin, Texas, where everything that she left behind is
stored today. 48 hours of shades of green and mustardy yellow, 48 hours of
train whistles, drip coffee and blunt panic attacks from being tucked away
under the plastic roof of the compartment at night. 48 hours of hope and expectations regarding the archive material, of finding what has been lost.
Lost (like my suitcase on the train) or never having existed.
Alice, as the object of my investigation is situated in a poetic space
shaped by the ineffable (Eisner 1981: 8), the allusion (Lyotard 1984: 81) and
silence (Irigaray 2011: 113). To meet her I have to enter that space, too, and
I can do so in writing.
My journey to Alice (1906­1950)—to her archive, to her still­existing
traces, to her home, but also to her as a character, as an obsession, as an idea
—is the setting and material for this text, which circles around the in­
­between, the absent present and the concept of Heterotopia. In creative
writing, I explore events or incidents that were hinted at in the archive material, but cannot be grasped or substantiated otherwise, as no other accounts
or sources are available to us, seventy years after Alice Kober’s death. My
work proposes alternative narratives to the existing ones and alternative
ways of immersing oneself in Kober’s life. It is a heterotopian practice insofar as I use my imagination to transform her letters into experiences, sometimes adventurous, sometimes mundane, like kids turning their parents’ bed
into a ship, as Foucault describes the locally constructed utopias in the imaginary realm (see p. 158).
The driving force behind this project is first and foremost an artistic one,
I am researching as a writer: my instruments are literary, my convictions poetic. As such, I embrace the formal frame of this project, that is, it being a
thesis and not a novel. It creates a unique opportunity to use my own writing
as a thinking machine (echoing Georges Perec’s “machine à raconter”,
──
19
which he constructed by composing the constraints for La vie, mode d’emploi, see Perec 1993: 7), to write while revealing and reflecting the process
and its implications.
Researching and writing were closely intertwined in this process and led
me on new paths in my artistic practice, some pieces were more than others
theoretically informed and reflective than others. Deciphering the Silence is,
as it were, a consecution and continuation of these projects, and also a
whole cosmos of its own. It is not only about telling Alice E. Kober’s story
or stories inspired by her life and her scholarly achievements towards the
decipherment of Linear B, but also about reflecting on writing as an inquiring gesture. This reflection incorporates debates about the knowledge of the
arts (Borgdorff 2012), and writing as a method of inquiry (Richardson
/St.Pierre 2008). I will establish a voice that comments, connects and creates
the space for me to disappear as a writer (Foucault 1984 [1969]). The image
of a room which exists in the writer and reader is interpreted through the
concept of Heterotopia as the site of the imaginary, and has a poetic guiding
function for this research:
Everyone carries a room inside him. This fact can even be
proved by means of the sense of hearing. If someone walks fast and
one pricks up one’s ears and listens, say in the night, when everything around is quiet, one hears, for instance, the rattling of a mirror
not quite firmly fastened to the wall. (Kafka 1991 [1953]: 1)
It is into this room which I rewrite Alice, a place of language, imagination, and the here and not here. It is a place that can be witnessed but not
proven. The fast walker seems alone in their room, surrounded by silence,
pacing around. The listener has no place, no presence in this room (no chair,
no shoes, no breath). They could be listening from next door or behind the
wall, but then they’d most certainly hear the steps of the walker and not the
rattling of the mirror. The listener is me and you, us, with our ears and head
bent over a piece of paper containing these lines. The listener is Kafka himself, listening inside himself, bent over his blue octavo notebook, writing.
──
20
This spatial congruence of the character, the writer and the reader, as they
are all inside this floating room, contains the possibility of an encounter in
language.
Language and writing is the object and aim of this research on many
levels. The most solid layer is Linear B itself, the Aegean script excavated in
Crete in the summer of 1900 by Sir Arthur Evans, which showed that the
cultural technique of script existed in the Aegean in the Bronze Age, almost
1000 years earlier than assumed—and, in fact, didn’t originate on the Greek
mainland. This sensation for classicists and archaeologists drove scholars
throughout the world to solve the riddle—against all odds (more details are
to come in the following chapters). Alice Kober was one of them, soon becoming the most important one because of her highly systematic approach.
For her, the deciphering work was merely about the signs and their relations.
She despised wild guesses and those who tried to find meaning before understanding the mechanics of the logical system.
“It is one thing to start by considering all the known facts, and to come
to a conclusion. It is quite another to start with a perceived idea, and try to
prove it. A scholar’s worst enemy is his own mind” (AK, untitled manuscript, PASP, Box 54.9).
The next layer—more paper, less clay—is Alice Kober’s writing, most
of all her letters, but also her notes, lectures and articles, through which I
met her. An encounter in her words and mine, an encounter that, like any
other, is brought into existence by language.
Irigaray proposes that a place of proximity (see Irigaray 2011: 112­3)
can be created in inventing a new language: one that embraces silence, different voices, and the momentary to avoid always directing words into the
past by referring to what already exists. To me, this project is about creating
a place or room of proximity within language, creating a language while
walking through an inner room, while hearing the mirror rattle.

Research Question
What brought this project about and kept me pursuing it was in essence
a curiosity which, at times, felt like a little blanket made from carbonic acid
wrapped around me: the excitement, the echoes, the discoveries. Just like
Alice, who became one of the few experts on Linear B worldwide, I became
one of the few Alice Kober experts worldwide. Probably the first German
speaker to read her German letters. Probably the first one to read her correspondence and pay attention to the tiniest of details. Probably the first one
without an established image of her in mind which her writings were to substantiate (see chapter 3). Nevertheless, I repeatedly experienced frustration:
with the limitation of the archive material, with voids, with accepting to not
know—even though my aim from the beginning was to write Alice Kober
back into the world, which included a fabulatory approach (see p. 35), I was
eager to drag up new details that others had overlooked, I was secretly longing for unambiguousness. This tension soon turned into the research question which I needed to find shards of answers for in the following stages of
my research, first in dialogue with theory and, eventually, through my practice itself:
How can ambiguous, missing and non­existent material in a personal,
archival context like Alice Kober’s case be challenged, sustained and sincerely replenished with literary means?
First, I followed what is framed in the question above with
“sincerely”—ways of writing which are conscious of the responsibilities
tied to a research project and to working artistically, a reflection of methods
that employ writing as a method of enquiry, and a reflection of the body of
──
22
my artistic work with regards to set approaches and methodologies (chapter
2), also including teaching writing.
In this reflection of language and writing in the context of a social reality, naturally, the poststructuralist positions of Barthes and Foucault were of
great importance. I read them as a writer and wrote about them as a writer.
This is to say, I purposely balanced theory and practice in a slightly unbalanced way—with more focus on practice. I’ve tried throughout to explain or
describe, as tangibly as possible the framework of my literary work: what
telling feels like, what using language feels like, what being silent feels like,
what being forced to remain silent feels like. Feels like as a naïve formula
for all that can be known and said about these actions or states explicitly.
My aim was to create a comprehensive account of working within language: another concept by Barthes at the centre of my methodology which
was confirmed and restated by Luce Irigaray. My unbalanced balancing of
theory and artistic practice was and is supported by her demands for a new,
sensitive and open use of language:
[…] without reducing this gesture [of communicating with another subject] to passing on some information, we must change our
way of talking, our use of words—we must be attentive to use words
that in themselves conserve life and pass it on instead of passing on
only information. We must use a language that remains breathful,
alive, sensible. (Irigaray 2002: 87)
I am, in this research, passing on information and I am doing so by using
words (whenever it is possible for me) which “conserve life”: beneath the
question of where to position myself in or towards the Kober archive material, there are many methodical questions. Some of these are: what does a literary exploration look like? When is writing aware of the language’s potential for “disturbance of the essential concepts of our culture” (Barthes 1967:
5)? How can a researcher/writer enter “the complete space of language, with
its logical subversions, the mixing of its codes, with its slippages, its dialogues, its parodies” (Barthes 1967: 9)?
──
23
There are (many) aspects of these questions that cannot be answered in
theory, only in or with the making. This is another aim, hidden in the word
evoked from above: making the making reveal itself, talk about itself. The
other aspects (for instance the ambiguity, the material which is missing) I
addressed through closely examining the notion of silence (chapter 4), of the
absent present, departing from Foucault’s concept of Heterotopia, in different realms: in the author’s practice and position in general (chapter 6), in being (or becoming) a female writer (chapter 4), in writing fragments (chapter
7). What made the absent present so important for my work was that it
paved the way for establishing space as an image to think about writing,
which led me to incorporate ideas of the Oulipo writers, with whose methods I have been working for years. Also, it bears in itself a certain blurriness
which may contribute to a breathful body of theory that, hopefully, has the
power to inspire writing and creative writing research projects other than
mine. Writing that has the power to “expose the question the answer hides”
(Baldwin 1962: 19).

Methodology
In the first phase of the research, before I had chosen the Kober project,
I created a fairly large body of creative work informed by readings about
writing, narrative and Heterotopia. It was a phase of a broad search in many
directions which led, eventually, to the Kober project and a focus on creative
writing as a method in the context of artistic research.
This decision was propelled by the fact that I was awarded a six month
artist residency in New York by the Canton of Berne (August 2017­January
2018). My stay in the US allowed me to be a visiting scholar at the University of Texas at Austin during October 2017, where I had round­the­clock
access to the Kober material at PASP (Program for Aegean Scripts and Prehistory), and was kindly welcomed and accompanied by Prof. Tom Palaima
and his team. In those four weeks, I went through all of Alice Kober’s letters, notes and notebooks multiple times, extracting passages that were relevant in terms of her work and everyday life.
To continue my work on the Kober project, I was invited to be a fellow
of Akademie Schloss Solitude, Germany, from June to October 2018, and to
be artist in residence in London, UK, from February to August 2019 by the
Swiss culture foundation Landis & Gyr.
During my residency in London I visited the Classical Studies Room at
the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (July 3­4) where, thanks to Dr. Andrew
Shapland, I had access to the Kober­Myres correspondence originals and
Linear B tablets. I was also granted access to the Ventris Papers at the Institute of Classical Studies (IoCS) at the School of Advanced Study University
of London (July 16­17) by Dr. Olga Krzyszkowska.
 In the Kober archive my first step was to review the material, with a focus on the letters and talks/papers Alice had given in conferences and as a
──
25
speaker for different societies and institutions. I did this firstly, because they
have not been published, and secondly because they are the most personal of
her writings that exist.
I read the documents several times, paying attention to all the details, especially those which allude to otherwise unmentioned events, relations, feelings. What I was trying to do was find hints that would allow me to better
understand Alice as a human being, and ultimately, to be able to write her as
a character. To understand a character, means finding the little edge of vulnerability and of oddness that everyone has, understanding their desires and
weaknesses which cause the friction vital to actually telling a story.
 I took notes while going through Alice’s correspondence, re­typed large
portions of the Kober­Daniel and Kober­Sundwall correspondences, and
compiled the paragraphs in her letters in which she talks about family,
friends, the illness, the war, and her journeys. In addition to this categorisation, I registered major events during the years while she was working on
the decipherment in a timeline.
Originally, I had planned to start writing just after my stay in Texas (or
even while still there), but I was very much overwhelmed by Alice’s presence—at times it felt like she was in the room with me, looking over my
shoulders. I grappled with her belief in objectivity or empiricism in general
──

Image 2: Timeline of major events in Alice Kober’s life 1945­1950, scan from my notebook
(see chapter 1) and needed to legitimise the project for myself, to find my
own way of dealing with the responsibility that comes with writing about a
historical person. What followed was a period of silence, of suffering from
Alice’s presence (in my thoughts) and absence (in my writing), in which I
reviewed research methods with proximity to creative writing (see chapter
2), to ultimately envision an approach for my own project which balances
the doubts and possibilities encompassed in creative writing with the responsibility and demands of a research context in a comprehensive and productive way.
Constraints and Guidelines for the Practice Part
The literary exploration of Alice Kober’s archive is a collection of prose
fragments (for a discussion of fragments as a literary form, see chapter 7)
that either:
a) respond to certain aspects of Alice’s letters;
b) reflect on certain aspects of Alice’s letters;
c) fictionalise certain events that must have, one way or other, taken
place, based on the information given in Alice’s letters;
d) present and discuss new material on Alice’s life that I found by
following hints in her letters/documents;
e) are a combination of the above­mentioned possibilities.
In the cases in which I have fictionalised, I put the text into context by
referencing significant passages from Alice’s correspondence that I had in
mind when writing. To clearly mark the fictionalised parts, they are
presented in a different font and always start with three asterisks. To further
highlight their status as alternative possibilities, I give, whenever possible,
more than one fictional version of a certain event. Sometimes they
contradict each other, sometimes they have different areas of focus. To be
──
27
able to do this, I’ve tried to write intuitively, to immerse myself in the given
scene without thinking it through in minute detail. The rule was to leave the
first draft (smaller changes during the editing were allowed) and to write a
new first draft, if I felt something had to be done differently.
The fragments are nestled into Alice’s own voice in her correspondence,
which is, from time to time, halted by longer cohorts of fragments, mostly
regarding my findings and their implications. While the literary exploration
is conscious of its narrativity and is aware and excited to be the first indepth discussion of Alice Kober’s correspondence, it is, in the form at hand,
not a manuscript for a book yet, for three reasons:
It does not repeat basic information about Alice Kober or Linear B or the
decipherment given in the theory part of the thesis.
It keeps track of the sources/references to make my writing traceable for
other scholars interested in Kober.
It is structured and constructed in a way that implies a writer’s
perspective more than a reader’s perspective.
The process of telling Alice’s story for a wider audience will occur after
this research is finished, based on the material found, insights gathered and
writing done during this research.
It will be the first fiction (well, half­fiction) book entirely dedicated to
Alice E. Kober. To my knowledge there is only one other literary text in
which she appears, The Element ­inth in Greek by Scottish author Alison
Fell (2012) (see chapter 3), who helped, with her research for the book, to
build up the information on Alice Kober’s family story which is accessible
in PASP. Her text is about Ingrid Laurie’s, the main character’s, research on
Alice Kober’s life—factual paragraphs are scattered throughout the detective and romance novel in italics, visibly separating the fiction from fact.
──
28
My project is entirely different, in the sense that it uses literary strategies
to explore hints and motifs I found in Alice’s letters. It is less about repeating the facts from the archive, than departing from them, interrogating or interpreting them in the creative realm. In this process, I chose those particular
moments in which insights are revealed that are not mentioned or followed
up by the two nonfiction books which cover Alice Kober (Fox: The Riddle
of the Labyrinth, 2013, Robinson: The Man who Deciphered Linear B,
2002). With this process, I put forward the idea of poetic knowledge that
opens up new spaces for thinking about the unknowable.
It is noticeable in more than one case that Fox and Fell rely heavily on
the same sources—namely the Kober Papers at PASP. While Fell conveys
more of the facts regarding the family background and Fox is more concerned with the methodological background of the decipherment, both authors repeat (for example) Kober’s chain smoking on the basis of the cigarette boxes as ersatz filing cabinets and draw a comparison to Rosalind
Franklin in discussing the fate of being deprived of scientific merit due to an
untimely death. This is not to say that any of this information is incorrect. It
is more that the limitation of the available material seen from a biographical
perspective becomes apparent in factually­oriented writing. This is why a
fabulatory approach (see p. 35) is needed, which embraces intuition, imagination and voids, ultimately, a reconciliation of the two bodies of literature
and science (see p. 31).
The Notion of the Anarchive
In his 2015 article AnArcheology for AnArchives: Why Do We Need—
Especially for the Arts—A Complementary Concept to the Archive?
Siegfried Zielinski unfolds his concept of the “anarchive”, a term he has
coined to describe artists’ archives—stacks of works, references and material organised in a way that follows personal principles, work­process­logic or
available space, rather than externally accessible systems.
──
29
They [anarchives] do not, however, lay claim to leadership. Nor
do they claim to truthfully know where things come from and where
they may be headed to. The origin is and remains a trap. Anarchives
do not follow any external purpose; they indulge in waste and offer
presents. Basically, they are indebted to a single economy, that of
friendship. And friendship, as Georges Bataille would have it (1971),
is characterized by an acute feeling of strangeness in the world,
which we occasionally share with others. (Zielinski 2015: 122)
While the Kober papers at PASP are fully organised and even partly digitised, the concept of the anarchive resonates with this research insofar that
I was the prefix of anarchy in the archive: I used it for my own logic’s sake,
I restructured the items in my memory and in notes to serve my process and
purpose. I, as an artist, became an anarchivist amidst the neatly labelled
boxes. I, too, am indebted to the economy of friendship, whose currency is
my “own strangeness in the world”. My mindset, with which I immersed
myself in the Kober archive, was from the beginning gentle and attentive,
but not uncritical, not uncritical of myself, too, of my own position. What
drew me to Alice was her strangeness in the world in which I saw my own
strangeness, although mine takes a different shape.
The idea of the anarchive recognises the value of alternative propositions, of simultaneity, and the absence of power. I, as an anarchivist, did so
in my own work too. I followed my own thoughts and the inspirations I got
from the material. I allowed myself to get lost, to lose or deliberately misplace ideas and preconceptions. In the archive itself, as goes without saying,
I was anxious not to disorganise the papers, to leave the order in order, so to
speak.
Knowledge Community and New Knowledge
The literary exploration of Alice Kober’s archive, as it is presented in
this thesis, is a contribution to the field of classics, in which I am a dilettante. It offers alternative views of long­standing representations of Alice
Kober. In one case, I was able to show that conclusions drawn in earlier
──
30
publications and biographies simply couldn’t have been true. This concerns
the alleged meeting between Kober and Ventris in 1948 in Oxford: While
this incident is usually interpreted against Alice Kober and used as evidence
for her cold and somewhat self­opinionated behaviour, I was able to show
that this meeting, in all likelihood, never happened. Apart from an archive
find what guided me was my writer’s instinct or sensorium for the situation
und social constellation Alice Kober was in. It is downright impossible to
write such a meeting with such a bad outcome that would, henceforth, never
be referenced by any of the involved (for an in depth exploration see pp.
331).
The literary exploration of Alice Kober’s archive is also a contribution
to the field of creative writing in the context of artistic research. The fabulatory approach (see p. 35) is a method that I developed during this project
and that I propose for exploring archives and other historical documents. It
is a research method informed by an artistic writing practice, which can
provide insights, questions and doubts regarding existing master narratives.
It is playful and imaginative but also sensitive and serious in its immersion
into the historic context and its particularities. This balance allows for creating knowledge and for understanding what cannot be known.
Aim: Creating a Space of Writing Within
Barthes stated in his 1967 article From Literature to Science, which was
published in The Times Literature Supplement, that science (he was addressing the debate of what was being taught at universities and what wasn’t) and
literature are, while sharing certain methods and aims, fundamentally different in their way of approaching language: “science speaks itself; literature
writes itself; science is led by the voice, literature follows the hand; it is not
the same body, and hence the same desire, which is behind the one and the
other” (Barthes 1967: 5).
──
31
While science needs and depends on language, it does not take place in
language itself; science uses language to communicate the ideas or facts
found with other instruments. It doesn’t question language. This means that
literature “is alone today in bearing the entire responsibility for language;
for though science needs language, it is not, like literature, within language”
(Barthes 1967: 5). I read this thought as a logical utopia, which does not
mean all research must be writing, but writing must, if one follows the
simplest means of science, namely logic, be or become part of the discourse
in the sciences.1
What Barthes demands of language is self­confidence and subversiveness, right up to the disintegration of the essential concepts of our culture:
Language is the being of literature, its very world: all literature is
contained in the act of writing […]. Ethically, it is solely by its passage through language that literature pursues the disturbance of the
essential concepts of our culture, ‘reality’ chief among them. Politically, it is by professing (and illustrating) that no language is innocent, it is by employing what might be called an ‘integral language’
that literature is revolutionary. (Barthes 1967: 5­6)
As a trained and published writer, I follow the hand when I write, and
also in doing research I have a writer’s body. This is to say, my aim is to establish an in­between­space which encourages thinking and working within
the language, balancing or expanding the writing into a dialogue with texts
falling in Barthes’ category of science.
Obviously, time has passed since Barthes’ statement of the separation
between science and literature, and today we see many approaches which
strive to bring them closer together (see chapter 1), but keeping the separation proved productive as a starting point, especially since the image of two
bodies resonates for me, with the two bodies of Alice Kober and myself.
1
 Cixous demands the the feminine writing (her way of phrasing the writing within
language) to be “an inscribing of some sort; it will be […] not as much a mastered writing,
that is, a writing that is aware of writing and observes itself while writing, but an alive
writing, ungraspable, in the realm of the subconscious, the phantasms” (Cixous 1980
[1977], 23, my translation), or, in a more poetic framing: “We [women] don’t manufacture
word­objects, no cans, no jewel boxes, no ‘book’. We create paths, in movements” (Cixous
1980 [1977]: 20, my translation).
──
32
How can I make them meet without destroying the world “which is proper
to each one” (Irigaray 2011: 112)?
Method-metaphors
To guide my research on Alice Kober within language, I have established two images that, for me, contain and create Barthes’ idea of a language that is not a tool, but an apparatus itself: silence and absence. I call
them method­metaphors, to emphasise the fact that they are not methods in
a science­driven understanding: they are not instructive, they are not definite, as this would automatically encourage the use of language as a tool.
They are images, encouraging an unfolding in language, personal and poetic. I will carry out my personal unfolding of those two method­metaphors in
chapters 5 (silence) and 6 and 7 (absence), interweaving reflective and creative practice to create a poetic thick description of my approach.
The image of silence is strongly based on Luce Irigaray’s writings, in
particular her text How Can We Meet the Other? (2011). With a different argumentation and aim than Barthes, she, too, contrasts language that speaks
of things (which equals the use of language to communicate) with the desired language that speaks with the other (language that is not a tool, but an
action, an instance of welcoming openness):
Silence is the word, or the speaking, of the threshold—a space of
possible meeting, of possible hospitality to one another. If silence
does not exist in our discourse, this one loses its most important
function: communicating with the other and not just transmitting information. Speaking with has to find its role again without being
subjected to speaking of. (Irigaray 2011: 114)
The image of absence is also connected to the concept of working within, via the artist’s responsibility in relation to the society following writer
and activist James Baldwin. In his 1962 essay The Creative Process, he as­
──
33
signs a secluded position to artists (who, in his view, are researchers, but not
scientists): a deep loneliness determines their existence, a fundamental separation from all other agents. The artists have to challenge the majorities’
narratives by embracing the certainty that they cannot contain the complexities of our lives and worlds. What enables them to do so is precisely the fact
that they think inside but are, themselves, outside common social structures
(I will elaborate on the motif of Heterotopia and writing as opening a space
to disappear in chapter 6):
The artist is distinguished from all other responsible actors in society—the politicians, legislators, educators, and scientists—by the
fact that he is his own test tube, his own laboratory, working according to very rigorous rules, however unstated these may be, and cannot allow any consideration to supersede his responsibility to reveal
all that he can possibly discover concerning the mystery of the human being. Society must accept some things as real; but he must always know that visible reality hides a deeper one, and that all our action and achievement rest on things unseen. A society must assume
that it is stable, but the artist must know, and he must let us know,
that there is nothing stable under heaven. One cannot possibly build
a school, teach a child, or drive a car without taking some things for
granted. The artist cannot and must not take anything for granted,
but must drive to the heart of every answer and expose the question
the answer hides. (Baldwin 1962: 19)
The image of artists who are their own test tubes, their own laboratories,
(this is to say that they share the scientists’ desire to understand the relations
of the world, but as they are not implied in existing discourses, they can be
more radical and profound in their scrutiny) can be seen as a variation of
Barthes’ statement that writing as a total code contains the scientific code
and thus is the only way to introduce poetic, pluralistic and peripheral
knowledge:
[…] writing seeks to be a total code, including its own forces of
destruction. It follows that only writing can break the theological image imposed by science, can reject the paternal terror spread by the
abusive ‘truth’ of contents and reasonings […]. (Barthes 1967: 9)
──
34
What follows on from these considerations is the basic layout of this research as deeply rooted in language and the belief that language is not innocent, cannot be used in a neutral mode. The two method­metaphors silence
and absence are interior imprints which, upon being unfolded in detail in
between theory positions and literary texts, trickled through my writing
about Alice. They informed my vigilant and compassionate immersion in
the archive material and my writing within it.
The Fabulatory Approach
I found the word fabulatory, or it found me, while I attended an artists’
talk and film presentation by Silvia Maglioni and Graeme Thomson at the
Whitechapel Gallery (Border Struggles (of the Common Birds), 16 May
2019) in London. The word is not on the handout which compiled important
texts for the pair, all of them from Jean­Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet. I
don’t remember who said the word or whether the voice was soft or coarse,
or if it came from afar.
While the adjective is a neologism, the verb ‘fabulate’ is found in the
dictionary, and means either ‘to create fables’ or to ‘relate an event as fable’.
‘Fabulieren’ in German means the same, telling stories in an imaginative
way or embellishing stories in a detailed way. There is a slight oscillation
between reality and fiction contained in the word, as a fable has, in some
cases, a connection to our actions and being in the world, which it tries to
explain morally or guide by a narrative, usually acted out by animals; the
fox, the donkey, the stork…and the camel? I, in my animal capacity in this
research project, found that there are in fact two qualities of fictionalising.
There is fictionalising which imagines what could have been (see the
chapter Body in the practice part, page 256)—I wrote scenes based on information from the correspondence, I imagined how Alice would have behaved in a certain situation into which I placed her, so to speak. But there is
also fictionalising which points out what could not have been. This approach
──
35
was not planned, but became apparent while I was writing the chapter Oxford and Ventris (see page 331).
While researching the alleged meeting between Alice Kober and Michael Ventris in Oxford in August 1948, about which I’ve always had
strange feelings (the way it is presented in the literature always seemed
wrong to me, or at least not quite right), I could show within writing, by trying to write it as a fictional scene, that it must have happened differently. It
is this process, this particular piece of writing, which demonstrates the idea
of creative writing as a method in (artistic) research most comprehensibly.
Doing what a writer does (creating coherent characters that have goals and
motivations, and also things to lose or risk through their actions) allowed me
to reveal the instances of doubt, of unrealistic behaviour that was (up until
then) believed to be true. The new knowledge this research proposes is
based in the very gesture of the writing hand, in my writer’s body, and is
twofold: the alternative perspectives on Alice Kober’s life, and the fabulatory approach as a method which brought these alternative narratives about.
The fabulatory approach as a method of inquiry requires an artistic practice: experience with writing narrative, character­driven prose, as well as
compassion and the ability to engage with the given material thoroughly and
openly. Without the intuition for a character and their possible courses of action, it cannot be applied. It also cannot be used to generate definitive propositions, it is a means of questioning rather than knowing, a means of complaisant doubt. In this respect, the fabulatory approach is interlinked with
the notion of the anarchive (see page 29), as it can be used as a method to
challenge assumed historical certainties, archives and their “consciousness
fundamentally tied to power” (Zielinski 2015: 116).
A precondition to using the fabulatory approach as a means of exploring
archives or other historic materials is to bear in mind the thread (of wool, of
fur, of feathers) that connects the narrative with some sort of experienced or
historical reality. Just as the fable is told in a way that allows for a recourse
to the world the reader lives in, the fabulatory approach, as a research meth­
──
36
od, has to respectfully embrace the reality of its object of investigation and
the reality of the researcher to be meaningful.
This distinction is, I am aware, quite subtle. I think I can show what I
mean by “embracing reality” when I contrast the fabulatory approach with
another artistic project I am working on. Since summer 2019, I have been
collaborating with Berlin based artist Patrizia Bach on a dialogue between
drawing and writing, in which we react to images from her extensive amateur photography collection. I write a text based on a photograph in five
minutes, and she creates a drawing for another one. Later, after shuffling the
drawings and texts, I write (again in five minutes) a text based on each of
her drawings and she makes a drawing for each of the texts. This procedure
results in two texts and two drawings per original photograph from the
archive: one set of drawing and text as a direct reaction, and one set as a
second order reaction.
This project is an example of an approach which I wouldn’t call fabulatory, even though it is embedded in an archive and composes alternative narratives, as I do not explore the photographs in writing: I let them guide or
inspire my writing. Although there is obviously a thread connecting the
writings (and drawings) with some sort of reality, which had been photographed by someone at some point of time, I am not fabulating, as I don’t
have any background­knowledge of the circumstances of the photograph or
the photographer. I am not fabulating, I am inventing: The texts I write show
what I see or find peculiar in an image, what it reminds me of. The texts are
more about me as a writer today than they are about the genuine moment in
the past in which the photographs were taken. It is a purely artistic project,
not a research project.
The fabulatory approach on the other hand can provide insights, questions and doubts regarding existing master narratives, because it is aware of
the contexts and immersed in the material it investigates. Following the fabulatory approach means to know as much as possible, to subsequently allow
for a sympathetic unknowing and re­imagining.

Literature Review
The literature review encompassed in this research is focused on four
main topics:
1) Writing about Alice Kober and the decipherment of Linear B,
2) Alice Kober’s writing (most notably her articles about the Minoan
languages and Linear B),
3) literary references,
4) theoretical texts about Heterotopia, writing and artistic research.
The literature review will be presented over more than one chapter in order to allow the theoretical texts to resonate: The method of writing within
necessitated a constant movement between philosophical concepts or ideas
and my own writing. What was thus established is some sort of an echo
space, in which theory and prose became interrelated. I will discuss the relevant references where they are most important, but some of them accompanied my thinking so steadily over the past four years that their influence
unfolded in many ideas and pieces, in some cases probably unbeknownst to
me.

Background
When I write on my typewriter, which I do regularly for first drafts,
spontaneous ideas or writing exercises, for making writing more physical
than it actually is—I make sure that nobody is around. Not out of consideration, but vanity. When I use the typewriter, it becomes audible how slowly I
think. I am questioning instead of claiming: this is my way of seeing the
world. I see incertitude and instability, and I tiptoe towards them because I
don’t want to frighten them away.
In hindsight, it doesn’t surprise me that this research endeavour took
every possible detour, as if following the cracks on a frozen lake and,
through that, permanently causing new cracks. A situation in which “the
only salvation is speed” (Bauman quoting Emerson, 2003: xii), Zygmunt
Bauman would have shouted to me benevolently from the bank, maybe even
waving an arm. But instead of speeding up I stayed right where I was, examining crack after crack.
From Code to Love
In the first preliminary sketch of my research, which was initially rooted
in my Master’s thesis but soon took on a different direction (in my thesis I
came, by reading literary texts against sociological texts and analysing the
condition of love in our age, to the conclusion that the code of inaccessible
love had emerged), I formulated a main question of whether writing is or
can be understood, to a certain extent, as loving. I was interested in the
beauty of the abstract, the quality of not being graspable, whereas in my previous work, with which I graduated from the only non­artistic study course
at the Berlin University of the Arts, I was fascinated by the sociologists’
rigour in coming up with criteria for love, of describing such an ungraspable
──
39
concept in seven or thirteen points. Back then I was a copywriter, trained to
break every idea down to its very essence, because if it doesn’t fit on a napkin, it actually is not an idea (or so were we told). When I started to map out
my PhD­research I had finished my creative writing studies, had published
my first YA novel and several texts in literature magazines.
From Love to Ghosts
By the time of the RDC2, I had decided to shift to a practice­based thesis and put an even stronger emphasis on all which eludes. Love can be understood as uncertain encounter, language as its primary medium encloses
vagueness and contingency. All thinking about love takes place in language,
often drawing from literature as data or echo space. In my research, I
wanted to approach the field from the opposite direction and explore the
theoretical positions and their implications in a poetic investigation. I
wanted to establish my own poetic methodology in order to answer the
question: “(how) can the ghostly, the ephemeral qualities of love be penetrated in (poetic) language?”
There were three assumptions at the basis of the designated project:
If reality is constructed and knowledge is performative, an (artistic) exploration has to embrace narrative.
As it is not possible to lodge love in writing, an exploration of love in the
realm of language has to be poetic.
As love, from a poststructuralist/postmodern view, is ghostly, it can be
framed by the concept of Heterotopia.
From Ghosts to Alice
I am still intrigued by the ghostly qualities of love and, one day, will reflect on them in writing, but in a literary context rather than a scholarly one,
to escape requirements and prerequisites. The two years in which my
thoughts (and my creative work, which I will delineate in chapter 2) circled
──
40
around the ghostly and the absent present were enriching and inspiring, and
provided the foundation for my Journey to Alice. The decision to reposition
and concretise the research came unexpectedly, but seemed natural, as it relied heavily on my artistic practice and intuition.
A method is a word that means nothing to me. I would not follow
one, as my work is analogous to a relationship of love. The text I
write is an object of desire to me. Between it and me, there is an exchange that occurs day and night. It does not matter if this happens
on paper or not. In some ways, I live with it constantly. All that
would happen within me—continuously fermenting emotions, desires, anxiety—I never cease to recapture and rework in order to return it to this other body in the process of maturing next to me. At
root, it is precisely as if I made more than another body with my own
body. (Cixous 2008 [1978]: 51)

Your idea about excavating Sardis sounds wonderful—if it can be
done. I don’t know of any better site. As a matter of fact, I don’t
really know much about sites—from the practicing archaeologists’
point of view. But imagine how wonderful it would be if a few bilinguals of assorted varieties turned up. I hope, though, that they aren’t
Semitic. Semitic and Egyptian are a nuisance, because they lack
vowel signs, and leave too much to the imagination.

I cringed when I read this letter for the first time. Cringed and looked at
my hands, which did not do much other than typing up imagination. I went
for a pecan coffee, passing the seating (designed by algorithms and cockiness) in the foyer of the computer science building, settling on a bench outside. I looked at the squirrels, at their self­absorbed operations in the shadows, as the brightness of the October sky folded over my inadequacy: a
fever blanket, a heavyweight writing pad, a pane of disillusion. I felt the
gradual cooling of the paper cup’s content and couldn’t drink it, couldn’t
pour it out, couldn’t bring myself to go back to the archive where you would
clearly frown upon me, or worse, push your glasses back with your index
finger, silently, with a letter of considerable importance in your hand, and
say in a conciliatory fashion:
Although I try very hard, I can’t quite reach Newton’s ideal ‘Ne facias hypotheses’. The closest I can get to it is to realize when I’m
building on a hypothesis and when I’m building on facts. I’m doing
my best to work only inductively, building hypotheses only when
facts warrant, and trying not to distort facts to fit a hypothesis.

Your deliberateness is inscribed in your face as a small, straight line
right above your nose, less a wrinkle than a scar, a mark that doubt and determinedness have left in equal shares. I nod. I don’t think that you have a
reason to be worried about not building your argumentation on facts: your
papers and manuscripts are so carefully written, almost a little grave. And I
know that in the end a hypothesis led to the decipherment, a more­or­less
wild guess. I’m relieved you didn’t have to witness this guess. Probably, if
you hadn’t have died, it would have been you who would have solved it, following your strict methodology, based on nothing but facts. I decide against
telling you that in the sign table you kept in one of your notebooks, where
you secretly assigned values (you never showed this table to anyone, let
alone published it)—all of them were correct. What fuelled your work was
the positivist certainty that an objective reality existed, whose truths could
only be understood through measuring facts.
In your unease with hypotheses we can meet: you, because you were
afraid they would cloud your judgement, me, because artistic work for me
never starts with an assumption, always with a question. Or, to be more precise, with curiosity, sometimes even rage. I wouldn’t call it crisis, as some
do. I imagine it simply to be a more dramatic way of expressing the fundamental need for “uncertainty and mystery rather than reliability and predictability” (McNiff 1998: 43), the need to make my own sense, to explore.
There is a definition of scholarship which states that a scholar is a
person who learns more and more about less and less until finally he
knows everything about nothing. It is supposed to be funny, but as a
matter of fact, it comes very close to stating a deep philosophical
truth. The more one knows, the more one becomes aware of how
much more there is to learn. Only the ignorant know everything
about anything, or, to put it more accurately, they think they know.

The definition of scholarship, the definition of research and the definition of reality are fundamental in any discussion of the research’s scope. Acknowledging the underlying paradigms and thus fundamental ontological
differences (which is, at least in the German­speaking world, still the main
problem in the debate about artistic research) sheds light on what we can
know of everything or nothing or the truth. Therefore, it is relevant to delineate the arguments which substantiate artistic, practice­based approaches in
my understanding of research, with their focus on language and narrative. I
will do this by revisiting positions which resonated most with my own work
and which proved helpful in my discussions with students in the process of
drafting their theoretical master theses and encouraging them to question
their preconceptions of research.
Let me recapitulate: There is a world.
If you don’t mind, I’d very much like to say this in italics:
Look, a world.
In this world, I can make connections or think of a colour or wear shoes.
I can draw boundaries, but I don’t believe in them.
And I am terrible at drawing.
Look, says the world, an I.

Expressing Experience—The Narrative Turn
Knowledge, no matter how it be defined, is in the heads of persons,
and […] the thinking subject has no alternative but to construct what
he or she knows on the basis of his or her own experience. What we
make of experience constitutes the only world we consciously live
in. (von Glasersfeld 1995: 1)
Resonating with postmodernist thought in the 1980s, the fundamental critique of the conventional conception of research provoked a crisis of confidence (see Ellis et al. 2011) and representation (Adams et al. 2015: 9), especially in the social sciences, resulting in a flight of questions: roughly, in my
understanding, the following: how is research done? (Methods focused on
facts/truths or experience?) From which perspective? (Inside or outside?)
For whom? (Those who are observed, or a scientific community?)
The question of perspective is crucial for the development of new methods
and alternative ways of describing the process and results. As researchers
became persons in whom the scholarly work was no longer conceived as
separate from life, private trauma, experiences and personal stories, they
could do other types of research—research focused on experience rather
than observable behaviour, research acknowledging different world views
and perspectives.
The narrative turn moves away from a singular, monolithic conception of social science toward a pluralism that promotes multiple
forms of representation and research; away from facts and toward
meanings; away from master narratives and toward local stories.
(Bochner 2001: 134)
The narrative turn is intertwined with the development of autoethnography,
an “approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyse (graphy) personal experience (auto) in order to understand cultural experience (ethno)” (Ellis et al. 2011: 273), which resonated with the
──
46
desire to “question from within” (Hutcheon 2004 [1988]: xiii), and which
has inspired a multitude of narratives over the last two decades.
Increasingly, these are artistic—poetic, dramatic, visual—which was surely
sparked by Carolyn Ellis, who, from her first autoethnographic book Final
Negotiations in 1995, established a novel­like style for her writing, with
characters, direct speech and detailed, often sensory descriptions. It is no
surprise that students, asked in which genre Ellis’ piece Maternal Connections (1996) belongs, are unanimously certain (the impatient ones rolling
their eyes at me for asking the question) it is an excerpt from a novel.
The founders of autoethnography place themselves close to literature. In
fact, they advocate a style of writing which is both literary and autoethnographic, to be evocative and engage with the reader, which is one of the key
criteria for autoethnographic texts. To achieve this, the author has to “embrace the vulnerability of asking and answering questions about experience
[…]. Autoethnographers embrace vulnerability with a purpose […] as Ruth
Behar writes: ‘The exposure of the self who is also a spectator has to take us
somewhere we couldn’t otherwise get to’” (Adams et al. 2015: 39­40).
This demand is of great significance for legitimising autoethnographic work
—it is bound to provide unique insights which would be difficult or impossible to gather with other methods, especially observation from an external perspective. The presentation of these narratives departs “radically
from the conventions of rational/analytic social science reporting” (Bochner
2012: 157), as the researchers are viewed as storytellers.
While in autoethnography narrative is used as a broad category of all sorts
of texts or art forms, Hayden White limits (in quoting Roland Barthes) narrative to a manner of speaking of events which is not discourse, not lyrical
or poetic. Nevertheless, he points out the great importance of narrative, with
special focus on historical representations:
Narrative might well be considered a solution to a problem of general human concern, namely, the problem of how to translate knowing
──
47
into telling, the problem of fashioning human experience into a form
assimilable to structures of meaning that are generally human rather
than culture specific. […] This suggests that far from being one code
among many that a culture may utilize for endowing experience with
meaning, narrative is a meta­code, a human universal on the basis of
which transcultural messages about the nature of a shared reality can
be transmitted. (White 1980: 5­6)
From a writer’s perspective these thoughts seem quite natural, and it is
astonishing to follow the intellectual efforts which had to come together for
establishing narrative as an accepted manner of reporting research and also
as a method of research. To me, the ability to make a claim is what characterises writing. Claiming a literary tone, a character, a place. Claiming the
relevance to write in the first place. And the other way round: every writing
is a claim, be it scientific or artistic.

Of Words and Games—Expressing the Ineffable
A piece of theory that is very dear to me is Wittgenstein’s elaboration on
inner feelings. I read about it when I still was interested in love as a meeting
of the Other in language and often, reluctantly, had to explain why I wasn’t
interested in neuroscientific or other physical approaches.
Wittgenstein talks about how we cannot communicate our inner feelings
to each other. As we don’t ever have a way to compare and understand what
we are told about somebody else’s inner experiences and feelings, we have
to accept being seen, read and heard indirectly. Wittgenstein asks and answers:
But could we also imagine a language in which a person could
write down or give vocal expression to his inner experiences–his
feelings, moods, and the rest–for his private use?––Well, can’t we do
so in our ordinary language?–But that is not what I mean. The individual words of this language are to refer to what can only be known
to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the language. (Wittgenstein 1986
[1953]: 88)
Schroeder explains this non­understanding further, taking pain as an example: “When other people complain about pain, we cannot know whether
any private experiences they might have are ever of the same kind as our experiences. […] Still, the word ‘pain’ has a common use” (Schroeder 2006:
208). It has a common usage, but only insofar as it refers to our individual
experiences: “Whatever you find painful is painful to you. That is what we
mean by ‘painful’” (Schroeder 2006: 214).
I’ll explain the relevance of this idea right after two short scenes that illustrate this impossibility on different layers. I like to think that both
happened in the year I first read Philosophical Investigations, but that might
not be absolutely true.

For two weeks C. and I were artists in residence in Kadiköy, Istanbul.
Two weeks of quickly­established work routines and living patterns: breakfast at the cedar­tattooed chef’s place, tea in the little stool place on the sidewalk or by the sea, dinner at the kebab grill close to our house. With every
kebab we drank ayran in a foil­lidded plastic cup, the blue­green brand. One
night we left home so late that only a strange little restaurant across the
street (where we hadn’t yet eaten, despite recommendations) was open. We
ordered tomato and bean stew and two ayrans. The ayran was served in foillidded plastic­cups, too, but it was the yellow­orange brand. It tasted horrible. I asked C. what he thought of this brand’s taste, and he said he quite
liked it. So I tried again, and unintentionally made a face. C. told me to pull
myself together. Composure, particularly in public, is crucial for him, being
Swiss. He removed the lid from his cup and drank in big sips—partly because he could live on yoghurt, partly to point out my fussiness. I ate the
bland stew, and when I was done I put the straw as far as possible to the
back of my mouth so that I could drink the ayran without tasting it. Pragmatism and frugality is vital for me, being German. But even with this technique I couldn’t finish it, because it was absolutely revolting. C. said he didn’t know why I was making a fuss, grabbed my ayran and before even putting the straw in his mouth he said: That one has gone off. He put it back on
the table and we decided not to complain, and never came back. I had plenty
of time to think about this real­life metaphor for the inability to communicate what is hidden inside, because my stomach became so sick that I couldn’t leave the house for nearly a week.

I was taken into this world by cesarean, and afterwards confined to an
incubator a couple of blocks away from my mother, the children’s and
adults’ hospital being two different institutions. My mother tried to pump
the milk which my dad delivered between buildings, but it didn’t work that
well, probably because the doctors had shown me to her for just a couple of
minutes before taking me away, or because she was in so much pain after
the surgery. When we finally met two weeks after my birth, we had drifted
apart. But we support each other nevertheless, and so I was with her when
she had to have intestinal surgery, her first invasion for 35 years, after having given birth to me. What scared her most was the prospect of being in as
much pain as in that cherry summer of 1982, when the midwife forced her
to get up and walk with embers in her belly. I sat next to her during the appointment with the anaesthesiologist, who told her point­blank that the surgery she was awaiting was way more serious than a cesarean, and wouldn’t
let her finish her sentences. When she couldn’t ignore my mother’s rising
panic anymore, she told her that post surgery pain will be ok, level 3 on a
scale of 10. I felt inclined to bring up my strong suspicion that pain level 3
had no meaning whatsoever. But as I just wanted us to get out of the consultation room, I bit my tongue. Guessing by the increasing temperature in
my mother’s hand that I was holding, it actually did calm her down. Level 3
(I understood later) was solacing, precisely because it was, in fact, meaningless, but the best way to communicate that the pain medication usually
works alright. “Tolerable”, for example, would have immediately raised
doubt: can I tolerate what others endure? I couldn’t deal with the cesarean
back then, even though everybody said it wasn’t that bad, so how can I do
this now? Level 3 said: way less painful than the most painful experience
you can imagine, without saying anything at all. I didn’t ask my mother if
she’d agree in retrospect that it was a level 3 pain, but given the fact that
only two days after the operation she was sneaking out on the balcony to
──
51
secretly enjoy a cigarette in a strict non­smoking hospital, that’s what it
seemed like.
Accepting the ineffable as a steady dimension of our day­to­day communication is, to me, a manoeuvre of beauty. It invites the necessity for poetic
expression—if nobody else can understand, compare or grasp what is inside
us, what we want to whisper, to mutter, to scream, we might as well cease
trying with precision and instead embrace a language which is open to interpretations, which opens up spaces for sharing and empathising. Especially if
the aim of research is to make experiences accessible, the need for a language that is aware of the inherent boundaries and able to create ever­new
ways around silence is apparent.
That this vote for incertitude shouldn’t be at all unsettling, as the absence of defined boundaries is a basic characteristic of the language, is discussed by Wittgenstein in his concept of “family similarities”. As he shows
with the concept of games, there are family similarities, but no common
overall criteria (see Wittgenstein 1986 [1953]: 32). It is impossible to draft a
definition that comprises all the senses in which the word “game” can be
used in German. He asks and answers, charmingly: “Can you give the
boundary? No. You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn. (But that
never troubled you before when you used the word.)” (Wittgenstein 1986
[1953]: 33).
(I especially adore this parenthetic assertion that, intuitively, we don’t
rely on boundaries or banisters. It reminds me of when a child can first take
a couple of steps on their own, and the only reason they stumble is the sudden realisation that nobody is holding their hand. We are not troubled, we
deal with blurred boundaries all the time, even without noticing: we walk on
our own.)

52
Pushing the Boundaries—Artistic Research
In Germany and Switzerland, the rise of the buzzword Artistic Research
is often, mostly by the critics, put in the context of the Bologna Process,
over the course of which art schools became applied universities and applied
universities had to establish or strengthen their research departments (see
Borgdorff 2006), and were thus denied intrinsic motivation or relevance.
That, in fact, the first theorisations of artistic research occurred in the 1980s,
in the United States, resonating with poststructuralist, postmodernist and
constructivist theory, is rarely mentioned.
To understand the potential and qualities of artistic research (also in
comparison to more conventional ways of creating and reporting new knowledge), I find Eisner’s seminal article On the Differences Between Scientific
and Artistic Approaches to Qualitative Research from 1981 extremely helpful (for a more recent overview see Borgdorff 2012). Eisner, from a background in education, carefully lays out the differences in assumptions, approaches and aims. Artistically oriented research, he states, focuses “on the
experience the individuals are having and the meaning their actions have for
others” (Eisner 1981: 6). An artistic approach to research, “instead of
presenting a facade of objectivity, exploits the potential of selectivity and
emphasis to say what needs saying as the investigator sees it” (Eisner 1981:
8). The investigator is “the major instrument of the research” (ibid.). The
aim of their work cannot be to predict but to explore, to create meaning
where it couldn’t otherwise be created: “What it yields at its best are ineffable forms of understanding that can only be conveyed through the figurative or nondiscursive character of the artistic image” (ibid.).

If only those squirrels under the bench and the tree with the funny red
nuts in front of the classics building, where the pecan coffee had cooled
down to air temperature, had said something. If they had said: You are the
major instrument of your research, dear.
Then I could have gone back inside and faced you and told you: You
might consider it dilettantish, but I am a writer and that is my power and I
have to use it, and I will. Therefore my research is “initiated by an artistic
hunch [or] intuition” (Rubidge 2004: 6), which will be followed by using
genuine artistic strategies or methods. This research “may not be linked initially to any formally articulated question, hypothesis or theoretical concern,
although it may lead to them […] may be generated later by the researcher’s
practice as their creative investigation into the artistic intuition or concern
progresses” (Rubidge 2004: 6). What distinguishes me from more conventionally oriented researchers might be a higher “tolerance for complexity
and confusion“ (Webb & Brien 2008: 3) and a profound willingness “to drift
for a while, making work, feeling [… my] way into a question or an idea
that may lead to an original contribution to knowledge” (Webb & Brien
2012: 193).
But, before you go back to your letter, let me ask you: Isn’t the intuition
worth considering? Without it, I would have never found you, would never
have been in your archive. Would never have read every single letter that is
left. And because I read differently than the others (the few who have dedicated their work to you) different things seem important to me. I don’t believe you were a chain smoker, for example. This doubt came to me one
night when reading your letters to Johannes Sundwall. He thanks you for
sending him sweets as the only treat he, as a former smoker, is entitled to.
Sweets that were rationed, for kids only, in postwar Finland. You were so
deliberate in your instructions for what you sent and how you tried to protect it for the journey and how it should be used after its arrival, that I can’t
──
54
imagine you wouldn’t have commented on being a heavy smoker yourself,
especially since it had meant a distant connection, a shared guilty pleasure.
Then your handwriting and the typing. I know that you were quite a multitasker—reading detective novels while knitting, your way of taking a little
break—but I can hardly imagine you interrupting the writing over and over
again just to knock some ash off, or to light or stub out a cigarette. It turned
out that the image of you as a heavy smoker was inspired by the cigarette
packs you used as filing boxes for your little slips of paper. Maybe your
brother smoked or your neighbours: I’m sure they would have collected
their boxes for you. But, definitely, it didn’t have to be you. I am not saying
this is a great revelation, but it is a new perspective. What has been written
about you so far is mostly collecting and comprehending rather than empathising and exploring. What I have in mind is offering “new ways of seeing and, in doing so, contribute some interesting and perhaps provocative
facts to the knowledge community” (Webb & Brien 2012: 195).
Von Glasersfeld shows how important language and writing is from the
radical constructivist point of view, when he states that “fictions are enormously useful in the organization of our experiences” (1997: 324, my translation), they can even “provide instruction for experiences one has not had
yet” (1995: 137). These statements are illustrated with the example that
somebody reads about Paris in a novel and thus learns certain facts (geography, streets, sights, culture etc.) about this city that can be applied in reality, when the former reader ends up as a visitor in Paris. The usefulness of
the fiction about Paris for a real life experience depends strongly on how
veridically the city was described. (When I first arrived in the East Village, I
was pleasantly surprised at how ordinarily people were dressed—just like in
Berlin, Bern or any other city I know, and unlike what Sex and the City had
me believe.)
Von Glasersfeld also gives a less fact­centred explanation of fiction, by
contrasting fiction and hypothesis: a “hypothesis is something you are ex­
──
55
pecting to, earlier or later, find evidence in experience for, a fiction is something from which you know from the beginning that you’ll never be able to
say in experience: it is like that or not like that” (1997: 324, my translation).
In summer 2016, I attended the Berliner Methodentreffen, a two day
conference which provides an overview of different qualitative research
methods. It was so hot that weekend that the glue on the tape which held the
multiple sheets of paper from which I had DIYed my poster together, titled
Die Mitte der zwei—Erzählen zwischen literarischem Text und autoethnografischer Mehtodik (The Middle of the Two—Narratives Between Literary
Text and Autoethnographic Methodology), simply volatilised, so it looked
very frazzled and confusing—artistic, as the other presenters with social science backgrounds put it. The so­called lunch keynote, which habitually addresses new methods, presented Mixed Methods, Emergent Methods and
Arts­Based Research2
. For the latter part, the speaker chose examples like
poetic transcription and ethno­theatre, quite frankly admitting that most of
her knowledge relied on a literature review, not on actively working with
those methods. I very quickly realised that I was the only (or one of very
few) artist(s) in around two hundred social science researchers and graduate
students. Some laughed, some snorted, many shook their heads. In the Q&A
part after the lecture, all the predictable objections were voiced, until somebody (a man in his late fifties, with long, scanty hair and most probably
open shoes) shouted: “Well, these are just more or less the same arguments
we heard against qualitative research back then, in the 80s, aren’t they?”

How can we think in, through and with art, if art is creative writing?
Tess Brady suggests that the writer’s method resembles the bowerbird technique:
Unlike my colleagues in other more traditional disciplines I
needed to acquire a working rather than specialist knowledge, not in
one area but in a range of areas and disciplines. I needed to function
a little like a bowerbird that picks out the blue things and leaves all
the other colours. To work with this metaphor, I needed to pick out
the dark blue pieces of ecclesiastical history, the azure lines of cartography, the sapphire decorations of medieval manuscripts and the
Nile blue theories of archaeology. (Brady 2000, online)
I think everybody who writes (or at least has to produce texts occasionally) knows the technique Brady is talking about. Indeed, collecting the bits
and pieces of information that are needed in the text or in a text’s sediment
means looking into a broad range of topics, from the raven’s breeding behaviour to different cosmogonies. (It also means getting lost in the internet,
and hours upon hours of brilliant excuses for procrastination.)
Over the course of my PhD studies I wrote many literary texts, some of
them exploring the concept of Heterotopia, some experimenting with different settings or strategies for writing. Others aren’t motivated or driven by
this thesis’ content, they are just on their own. To enter the discussion of
writing as a methodology, I present some of the texts from the second type
—pieces in which the method is constitutive for the final result. Of course,
not all the processes of my writing are visible to myself, and every text
draws from more than its approach and more than I can trace. In the following examples, I deliberately discuss only discrete aspects, movements that I
am aware of and that make sense to highlight in hindsight, with the aim of
creating an overview for myself and being able to discuss potential methods
against the background of concrete projects. All of the texts were originally
published in German: I translated them into English to appear here or in papers/articles.

Interview-based I—Childhood Stories
Childhood Stories is an audio drama series which composes narratives
of childhood in order to create an authentic image of the social environments in which people grew up. For the first edition in China (2012) I asked
about 35 people 12 very simple questions about their childhood (in written
form, in Chinese). Later the answers were anonymised, translated into English and used as literary material, condensed and cut up, arranged in a dialogue. The voices were embedded in a composition from field recordings
(music: Christian Müller). For the second edition (2015­2018), I asked the
same questions in Istanbul, Turkey. This time, I decided to compose the 28
sets of answers (also in English) in a choir­like text for four female voices,
to echo Istanbul’s very lively and sometimes overwhelming sound texture.
A Once my mom fell into the pond and got a terrible cold.
B How can a woman
C a grown up woman
B fall into a pond?
C That sounds bizarre
B don’t you think?
D Every story is bizarre. Otherwise we wouldn’t bother to tell
it.
A Maybe she stumbled or slipped or it was in the middle of the
night or whatever.
B Slipped?
A In the rain
C or it was
D in the middle of the night.
A I was scared at night.

C Of the darkness.
D Of insomnia.
A Of the shadows.
B Of the monsters.
D Of a giant grabbing me and taking me with him.
A Of my grandma not waking up again.
B I used to get up, just to check if she was still breathing.
The data gathering followed a classical questionnaire scheme, the choice
of participants was not lead by defined criteria, but by whoever wanted to
participate. While I didn’t invent anything, I altered the material during the
collaging process through repetitions, contrasts, intensification; according to
dramaturgic and aesthetic reasons. These emphases reflect my personal way
of making sense of the material and also, to some extent, my experiences in
Turkey. While I wouldn’t claim that this is a piece of research, I think it is
legitimate to say that it uses basic methods borrowed from qualitative research.

Interview-based II—Transform
In early 2016, I was part of the 5th annual Transform Festival in Berne, a
monthlong transdisciplinary festival which invites different groups of artists
to stay in a quarter in Berne (Loryplatz/Europaplatz) for one week and realise a piece of work which is either site specific or developed in exchange
with local people and businesses.
For the week in which I participated, I was based in an instrument shop
specialised in reeds, and besides just watching what happened and occasionally using the typewriter, I talked to the staff about their job—what they
liked about it, why they had chosen it, which tools and materials were their
favourites. From the notes I made from these conversations, I finally selected words and sentences which I asked the local engraving shop to write on
badges. (It was the order of the year, judging by the friendly way in which
the owner treated me.) After they had been made, I scattered them in the
quarter by mounting them on lamp posts, benches and structures: as ephemeral as graffiti. At the showing at the end of the week, which took the form
of a guided walk through the quarter, I introduced my project but didn’t
point out any of the piece’s locations (which lay along the route of the walking tour), inviting the participants to see their own neighbourhood with a
new focus—on all that is overlooked.

Interview-based III—Unstable Dictionary
As a literary documentarist I was invited to the electronic music festival
Instabile Systeme, which took place in Biel from 26 to 29 June 2018. After
contemplating what a literary documentation could or should be, I decided
to ask the musicians what their strongest association with instability (the
festival’s theme) was. They gave me a word and in a short open interview
they told me why they had chosen it, and what it meant for them and their
work. Then I wrote a short poem or prose fragment which contained the atmosphere or texture of what resonated most with me from our exchange. It
quickly became a game: audience and musicians trying to trace which word
came from whom, adding words to see them transformed on the typewriter
in new texts.

Poetic Field Notes
In spring 2018 I was commissioned by the Transhelvetica Magazin to
visit a construction site close to Solothurn, Switzerland, and to literarily observe what was happening there. The method I used to write this text can be
summed up as Poetic Field Notes—incorporating associations and memories into a protocol of events. Unlike a researcher who studies a field, I had
no prior knowledge about the processes, machines or routines. I came as a
blank page, so to speak. My text became an inventory of outward and inward impressions. There were not many changes made between the first and
the final version (which is rare in my work), so that the text still reflects the
fleetingness of the writing situation, the wandering of my senses.
A man walks in my direction, without a helmet, without orange, but with
a phone and gloves in his hand. Now he sits on a wicker chair, takes his tshirt off, the cigarette still in his mouth, pulls a laptop out of a black sleeve,
same brand as mine, the screen seems to be as dirty as mine. He wipes it
with his shirt, pollen or construction dust or maybe both are one and the
same: microscopically small friction loss between status quo and scheduled
progress.
[…]
For the first time, the excavator’s shovel comes to the fore, emptying itself out unmistakably and turned to the side, already three shovels, now the
fourth, I’m writing more slowly than an excavator excavates. I would have
thought my head was less inert, the fifth, was at an advantage, because of
being made of, the sixth, cellular material instead of metal, but apparently
the slowness of, the seventh, metal is a misapprehension on my side, which
is hereby proven wrong.

Writing as an Echo Space—Residencies
Over the last couple of years, being abroad for longer periods of time
became an important strategy for writing. In every year of my PhD studies,
apart from attending composite sessions in spectacular cities, I had the opportunity to visit places I had never been to before as artist in residence (for
full list see Appendix, p. 441), which was a great privilege and tremendously inspiring for my work. Being in a different cultural environment requires more permeability of skin and more porousness of thoughts. I can be
a child, constantly amazed, I can be a guest, humbly human. I am mostly silent: I absorb the place’s peculiarities and while they are going through me,
stories which represent them form. Sometimes immediately, sometimes
later, sometimes they are based on things I see, sometimes it’s more a
place’ s mood that stays with me and subsequently becomes inhabited by
completely fictional characters, animals and humans.
Cheshire Cat
Tok is sitting up so high that most people aren’t aware that he’s there
when they come in. They go straight to the fridges, which take up the whole
length of the store. They choose a beer, maybe they ask someone waiting
outside: “They also have the dark one, would you prefer one of those?” Or:
“Do you think she’ll drink two big ones?” Afterwards they come to the till
and only now, when I hand them their change or fumble with the plastic
bag, do they become aware of Tok’s leg, which—from their point of view—
dangles directly from the ceiling. At this moment, they might not think of a
cat as I do, because they have never seen how Tok jumps up and grabs hold
of the ceiling’s rim with his fingertips to pull himself up the two meters in
one breath of air. It is a child’s leg, even though Tok has not been a child for
a long time now. So smooth and thin. A woman who was about to pay for a
──
66
lighter knocked the chewing gum display over in shock. Tok can be sitting
there for hours without talking. He knows that I’m looking at his legs. And I
know that I like them. This is the certainty we have been living on since
we’ve met.
Prehistoric
In the garden I’ve found a small, prehistoric animal. Its name is Adda,
just like my daughter’s. I had to take care of a couple of things outside, for
example I’ve finally fixed the loose step by the front door. Jòn lent me his
power drill. After I tightened the screws, I swept the stairs and I emptied the
dustpan out under the juniper. It was there I found the animal. It looked
right at me and made a tiny sound, as if trying to scream backwards. I
showed it the dustpan and it climbed on it, its hooves clacked on the plastic.
I mean, I don’t know if it really has hooves, but in any case it has keratin
down there. It’s about the size of a redshank, but with four legs. Its eyes are
very much awake. I wanted to set it down again, but it kind of clenched its
teeth into the plastic. Then I brought it to Adda’s room. Since she has started
university, she only comes by every three or four months or so. The animal
is sitting in the bedding box right now, and I’m trying to find out what it
likes to eat. The oldest food I have found is some potatoes from last winter
and canned mustard pickles from the winter before. If it doesn’t like any of
that, I will go and get a fern plant, I guess.
Tok is based on that exact visual described in the text: a young man’s leg
in the roof of a liquor shop in the liberal quarter of Kadiköy, in Istanbul.
Adda is from the Icelandic collection of texts, and its origin was a sentence
that was somehow inserted into my head (I think I even heard it in an inner
voice) during a poorly­equipped night walk through way­too­high and quiet
snow: I’ve found a prehistoric animal. To me, these stories are amalgamated
with their places of origin, they transport how I felt there. I know that I
──

couldn’t have written any of these texts without being in these different contexts, because they struck tones in the language I didn’t even know existed.

Words and Voice—Performances
For almost ten years, I have been closely collaborating with the improvising and experimental musician (and my partner) Christian Müller in our
stories & sounds duo, Butterland. We have realised audio dramas, live performances and created culinary, immersive environments for the audience in
which we presented our work (for a full list, see Appendix, p. 443). What we
do is neither a reading with musical backing nor a concert incorporating
words. It is something in between: a space in which texts that are musical
and music that is narrative can meet. Space is, again, my metaphor for describing how the texts I write for the stage—texts to be heard—differ from
texts I write to be read: it is about inviting the audience into a room that is
created in the moment, always from scratch as Christian improvises and,
even though we know each other very well, I (and even he) cannot predict
how his part will turn out, if there is a flow, if it works, or if it does not.
When it does work, the room gets its volume from the music, and its structures from the images the texts evoke. I have a stack of fragments for each
performance and the duration of the set is usually roughly fixed. Apart from
that, there are no cues, no agreements, no rules. When I first began working
with Christian I was so afraid of missing the end, which is a common phrase
for dressing down musicians in the improvised scene (this guy just missed
three endings, right?), that I stopped reading as soon as I heard the faintest
possibility of the piece being over. Today, I have a better feeling and more
confidence, but it still is (and will be) an entirely different way of being
(that is, thinking with the ears and knowing intuitively what to do) which
performing like this requires, as opposed to just reading a text which is linear and only dependent on itself. Performing on stage with music, as a musical voice, is probably the most obvious way of disappearing. Not while
──
69
writing, but while reading: there is nothing to see, I am not performing in a
physical way, but sitting or standing still. I have to fully focus on the music,
so I cannot be in contact with the audience most of the time. I am in the
room as a voice, and as that voice I am in the audience’s imagination.
This voice, though, is a different one to that which Barthes had in mind
when he contrasted the two bodies of science and literature (“science speaks
itself; literature writes itself; science is led by the voice, literature follows
the hand; it is not the same body, and hence the same desire, which is behind
the one and the other”, Barthes 1967: 5). My voice follows the hand as it is
not sharing facts, but communicating: it allows the audience to resonate
with the words in their own, individual ways. The voice also embraces the
hand by being silent. When to start reading again? When to stop? These are
decisions that cannot be made analytically (while Christian is an instant
composer and builds his pieces in the moment he plays, I, as a dilettante,
don’t have the musical knowledge to know what he is doing, I can only
listen to what the music tells me), they can only be developed from what
happens around them. The words write themselves as a voice.
As an example for my performance work, however, I chose to present a
different piece: Im Zwischen, a piece by the singer Hannah E. Hänni for
voice, cello soundtrack (by Martin Birnstiel) and text (by me), which
premiered in June 2017 in Biel. My texts circle around Kafka’s image of the
room inside, and were created in the way I have just outlined, but were, in
the end, fixed: I developed a score with a precise timeline because the cello
soundtrack was also static, and during the rehearsal process I could work out
the best way to put the texts into dialogue with the music. As a whole, it is
less improvised than the way I work with Christian, and it includes a visual
layer which the Butterland pieces don’t have, but the texts are rooted in this
research as they explore the spatial notion of writing and performing from
different angles.

The Bowerbird Technique—Castor & Pollux
Of course, I use the Bowerbird Technique a lot, especially for commissions with thematic demands. For example for the performance of ephemer
in Berne, during the Musikfestival 2017, a piece for four voices, four reeds
players and a bridge. The festival’s theme was will­o’­the­wisp’ and for my
text, which was the overture to the performance, I interwove old texts about
sightings and scientific explanations of the phenomenon with literary texts
about Castor and Pollux (as this is the name of two will­o’­the­wisps on the
open sea), loosely incorporating the mythological story.
In the open street shot by a truck Castor dies, one pointless sacrifice
among many. Unfortunately Castor was the mortal of the twins, alas, Zeus
can fidget with lightning for as long as he wants. For Pollux though nothing
is left but a brother’s sorrow, he doesn’t think of segregated areas, wirepullers, progressions of events. Castor’s face everywhere, multiplied in elliptic incremental points, and yet he doesn’t cease to exist in Pollux’s lazy
eye, those narrow brows and the beard reminiscent of feathers. Pollux, embodying the brother, his appetite, his sarcasm, who refuses to be a memorial
on the mountain of gods. Pollux, who begs his father to dismiss him from
immortality, to let him go down to his brother, to the flesh.
I might not be a real bowerbird, because I don’t care for the colour of
my finds—at times it is more about finding anything at all, an angle to start
the project. In general this activity is what I’d call in German recherchieren.
Recherchieren is one word for ‘research’, another is forschen. Forschen,
which is used for researching in an academic or scientific context, requires a
stronger focus on the generation of some sort of knowledge and is closely
tied to natural sciences. Recherchieren is following the need to substantiate
──
72
a narrative one way or another, adding detail or background knowledge,
finding answers to whatever questions arise on the route to realising a project.
──
73
Thinking in, Through and With Art
The question of how creative writing fits into the scope of academic research, and which gaps in the existing knowledge can be addressed through
writing, is debated for example in TEXT Journal of Writing and Writing
Courses, extensively in the special issue The ERA era: creative writing as
research (Brien et al. 2010)
4
. This issue compiles a selection of peer­reviewed creative works which are situated in the context of research. At the
end of every text, there’s an author’s statement about the research background, contribution and significance. Among the contributions are, for example, the exploration of a first person narrator in a documentary text or an
insight into parents’ grief after the death of a young adult child from cancer.
Trying to explicate my own methods and compiling the excerpts from
the different texts was an insightful process. Before I began to work on this
chapter, I had a sentence in the opening section stating that during my PhD,
I did a lot of unrelated creative work. I later wanted to make this sentence
sound a bit more confident and purposeful, more a strength and less like an
excuse. Only when I thought about how I could turn this around, what parallels could be found in these very diverse texts, did I see how inscribed methodological approaches are in my work—they were so deeply incorporated
into my process that I wasn’t even aware of them.
In the last two years I have often relied on techniques to gather different
kinds of data, which then served as starting points for my literary writing.
The decisions came naturally, as my main interest in writing is seeing the
world, relations, and absences, therefore I need to meet them. To me, the
question or dialogue at the centre of emergence is crucial for texts like
Childhood Stories or the Transform piece, and I do, whenever I speak about
the creative processes, mention their context. For Childhood Stories, it is es4 http://www.textjournal.com.au/speciss/issue7/content.htm (accessed 15 December 2019).
──
74
pecially relevant to give this information, as it changes the perception: it is
more documentary than fiction, it enables a poetic understanding—through
making experiences accessible—of a certain part of a society at a certain
time.
The faith in process, in not putting a research question in the beginning necessarily but an intuition is in my conception a crucial feature of artistic or practice­based research, it emphasises that it is not
formal knowledge that is the subject matter of artistic research, but
thinking in, through and with art. (Borgdorff 2012a: 44)
When and how is creative writing research? Following Borgdorff, it requires thinking in, through and with creative writing. In my interpretation,
thinking in writing means that the creative text is the result, through writing
that the creative text is only a partial result, which needs some sort of supplement to communicate the intended result, and with writing might not
even involve the act of writing, as it uses texts as examples or data which is
then analysed. Given these categories, Childhood Stories could be research
through writing: the answers from the questionnaires are made accessible
and engaging through writing strategies as character speech, montage,
rhythm. Even though the other pieces use research methods, I don’t regard
them as examples of artistic research because they are not written with the
intention of being an answer to or asking a specific question—to return to
Borgdorff’s terms: it was just writing, not thinking in writing. A creative
writing project is thinking in writing, as soon it departs from a non­self referential question or is deliberately anchored in discourses or theories and
contains its answers in an appropriate form.

Writing as a Method of Discovery
Writing as the construction of an inner space for the readers. Sometimes
turmoil, seldom escape. Writing as my way to veritably exist in the world, to
have a voice that can speak silence. Writing as a “method of discovery”
(Richardson 2001: 35). I can write in order “to learn something that [… I]
didn’t know before [… I] wrote it” (ibid.), as the postmodernist position
“does allow us to know ‘something’ without claiming to know everything.
Having a partial, local, and historical knowledge is still knowing” (Richardson/St.Pierre 2008: 961). There is a more artistic interpretation of the desire
to write as an inquiry in Carolyn Ellis’ statement about what drives her autoethnographical work: “I tend to write about experiences that […] challenge
the construction of meaning I have put together for myself. […] I write
when my world falls apart or the meaning I have constructed for myself is in
danger of doing so” (Ellis 2004: 33). It is an epiphany or a minuscule moment of being startled that makes me question myself or the world as I see
it. What I do if I write about it is to “invent allusions to the conceivable
which cannot be presented” (Lyotard, 1984 [1979]: 81).
On my journey to Alice, I use writing as a method of inquiry, as Laurel
Richardson describes it: gaining understanding through the very process of
(literary) writing. Thus I am not following the design of fiction as research
practice, coined by scholar and writer Patricia Leavy (2013), who considers
fiction a “highly effective pedagogical tool” (Leavy 2013: 10) to disseminate research findings, but the findings are gathered through conventional
qualitative research methods like interviews. I don’t use the literary text to
write findings about Alice Kober and her life, but to construct a literary
space which she inhabits as the Other that I can meet.
──
76
Autoethnography is a method that is very close to creative writing, and
encourages artistic approaches and forms. Commenting on the intersection
of literary and autoethnographic writing, Ellis states: “If you viewed your
project as closer to art than science, then your goal would not be so much to
portray facts of what happened […] but instead to convey the meanings you
attached to the experience. You’d want to tell a story that readers could enter
and feel a part of” (Ellis 2004: 116). As autoethnography puts the I, that
writes and tells, that experiences and shares, in the beginning of all writing,
it becomes a “way of life. It is a way of life that acknowledges contingency,
finitude, embeddedness in storied being, encounters with Otherness […]”
(Jones et al. 2013: 53). Life is the source of experiences, experiences the
source of writing. The undertaking only makes sense if it is seen as a whole:
everything, every aspect of life can become a theme for writing, can shape
the writing into what it needs to be. Eisner stresses that in “artistic approaches to research, standardization of form is counterproductive. What
artistic approaches seek is to exploit the form to inform. What those engaged in artistic work take as given is the belief that form and content interact; some would say that form is content” (Eisner 1981: 7).
Bochner and Riggs highlight the great importance of the connection
between researcher, research, and life: “The researcher is part of the research data […,] writing and/or performing research is part of the inquiry,
research involves the emotionality and subjectivity of both researchers and
participants, […] research should be about what could be (not just about
what has been)” (Bochner/Riggs 2014: 201). This last parenthesis is especially important for this research, as it legitimates projection and the fictional extension of the material found in the archive. Another strong congruency
between creative writing and autoethnography is the involvement of the
reader, they “should be conceived as co­participant, not as a spectator, and
should be given opportunities to think with (no just about) the research
──
77
story” (ibid.). This mirrors the poststructuralist idea of texts materialising in
the reader, individually, and not in or through the author (see chapter 6).
But there are also criteria which aren’t or are not necessarily met by creative writing, namely the vulnerability of the author and the focus on cultural understanding. The exposure of the writing subject through autoethnography can take on quite radical forms: “giving public insight into long hidden secrets like suffering from bulimia or being a night club dancer. You
have to have a strong ego to write autoethnography—to make yourself vulnerable to criticism about your most personal stories” (Davis/Ellis 2008:
284). In the genre of memoir and elsewhere, creative writers expose themselves in such a radical way, too. It is not a condition to write however, and,
most importantly, the writers can protect themselves from being unwillingly
exposed by inventing or fictionalising certain aspects or finding metaphors
or alternative structures to write about very personal experiences without
declaring it.
I started my career as a writer, like many writers do, with a very personal book: Katertag (Dürig 2011, see Appendix for full list of publications, p.
441). It was about growing up in a dysfunctional family, due to the parents’
alcohol abuse. Even though it was and is highly personal, it is not about me
or my family, as I invented a whole new family and background story: the
narrator is a boy—one of the many distancing strategies which, in the end,
enabled the writing in the first place.
Earlier, during my final year of studying creative writing, I had a project
which was rooted in my family. I wrote portraits. Portraits of my parents, of
their parents and their parents’ parents. I wrote about people I had heard
about only a couple of times in my life. That might seem strange—at least it
does to me—but my mother’s family came from north­eastern Germany, a
region which is Poland today, and there you don’t talk much. You work, you
live. They had to leave everything behind during WWII, and when they finally found a place to stay in southern Germany, their accent was alien and
──
78
they were even quieter than at home. On my father’s side, too, there was
war and eviction. I assume that on both sides there was guilt.
They couldn’t forget, but they could cease remembering. This is why
even about my grandparents, who I knew in person, I hardly know more
than their dates of birth and education. I grew up in silence. This silence or
void was what I tried to recapture with my literary project. My parents and
my grandparents became characters in my texts. For the first time in my life,
I understood why they were so constricted. Of course, it was my version of
them which I understood, but it was at least some sort of understanding. I
never finished that text after my graduation, I never published it. It helped
me to find my tone, my style. It helped me to find the room inside from
which I can tell stories. My stories, other stories.
When I wrote Katertag, I didn’t fill in gaps. I had everything in my experience, but I had to make it accessible. How can I tell what is ineffable?
How can I allow others to enter the sites of silence? These questions led my
writing, in which I did not want to go through my personal story again, because it was a story of weakness.
The weakness of a child who knows that everything is wrong but can’t
fix any of it. I wanted sovereignty, I wanted a strong voice. I had to write
about what had not happened to convey what happened. This tension
between what is there and not at the same time is enclosed in the first sentence of the book, the first sentence in which the main character, a young
teenager, writes to his dad: “I need you to know what I have to forget”
(Dürig 2011: 7, my translation).
In Katertag, my voice, though not exposing me, is at the intersection of
the personal and the cultural, thinking, writing and describing. I “locate the
general in the particular [… and] attempt to shed light on what is unique in
time and space while at the same time conveying insights that exceed the
limits of the situation in which they emerge” (Eisner 1981: 7). As Eisner
shows, pieces of literature are not limited to the particular story they tell, but
always reflect a larger social reality or a critique of it. The personal is what
──
79
leads to the cultural. The cultural, the “ethno” as motivation for the writing,
is what distinguishes autoethnography from memoir/autobiography: it is
crucial that the accounts aim to reveal insights that can be meaningful for
other members of the same cultural environment. The individual narrative is
one case of a collective or more global narrative, the particular has to point
to the general. The awareness of how a narrative is embedded in a larger
context is, even if it is not mentioned explicitly, what characterises autoethnography:
Autoethnographers intentionally use personal experience to create nuanced, complex, and comprehensive accounts of cultural
norms, experiences and practices. Autoethnographers offer these accounts […] to facilitate an understanding, and often a critique, of

The Careful Alien—Literature Review
──
81
Alice Kober and Michael Ventris
During the last few weeks, I’ve suddenly come to the conclusion
that the Knossos and Pylos tablets must, after all, be written in Greek
—an difficult and archaic Greek, seeing that it’s a 500 years older
than Homer and written in a rather abbreviated form, but Greek nevertheless. […] As we expected, they [the inscriptions] seem to contain nothing of any literary value, but merely record the prosaic and
often trivial details of the palace administration. (Ventris 1952: 8)
This is how the British architect Michael Ventris, then 29 years old, announced his groundbreaking achievement on 1 July 1952 in a transmission
on BBC’s Third Programme, after having summarised where Linear B was
found and what difficulties the decipherers were presented with:
It’s often alleged to be quite impossible to decipher a set of inscriptions where both the writing and the language are unknown
quantities, and where there’s no bilingual to help us. But provided
there’s enough material to work on, the situation is not hopeless at
all. It simply means that, instead of a mechanical piece of decoding,
a rather subtle process of deduction has to be undertaken. It’s rather
like doing a crossword puzzle on which the positions of the black
squares haven’t been printed for you. (Ventris 1952: 5)
In presenting the milestones that, eventually, led to the decipherment, he
mentioned in the following order Champillon (who deciphered the Egyptian
Hieroglyphs with the help of the trilingual Rosetta Stone), Schliemann (as
the one who discovered Mycenae), Sir Arthur Evans (who, looking for script
from that same period, went to Crete and discovered Knossos, Palace of the
legendary King Minos, with its Linear A and B tablets), Sir John Myres
(whom Evans had entrusted with the task of publishing the Linear B material) and Emmett Bennet (who worked on and published Blegen’s Linear B
inscriptions from Pylos). Ventris did not mention Alice Kober, even though
he pointed out that a “great help in finding out which signs belong together
──
82
is the fact of inflection” (Ventris 1952: 7). A great helpful fact that was discovered by Alice and published in her 1946 paper “Inflection in Linear
Class B: 1­Declension”, a paper Michael Ventris had read and which had
“slightly disappointed” him, “because the ‘terminations’ don’t really seem to
carry us beyond Evans’ note […]” (MV to JSM 28 January 1948, Ashmolean Museum).
The time at hand was scarce, one might think, between 7.25 and 7.45
p.m. on this 1st of July. Why would Ventris, who would decades later be celebrated as A Very English Genius (the title of a BBC documentary about
him, televised in 2002), sacrifice twenty precious seconds of his and the
grand men’s fame to bring up a scholar that wasn’t even alive any more, female or not? (He also failed to mention Johannes Sundwall, who was still
alive then, or his correspondents whose ideas about Linear B he compiled in
his Mid Century Report5
.)
In the first paper discussing his theory, Evidence for Greek Dialect in
the Mycenaean Archives (1953), written together with John Chadwick, who
provided Ventris with linguist knowledge and was the first scholar to embrace Ventris’ theory, Alice Kober is mentioned six times, namely her ideas
of inflection and the sign for “total” in female and male.
In his 1954 paper The Decipherment of the Mycenean Script given at the
Second International Congress of Classical Studies (the proceedings were
published in 1958), Ventris credits Kober to have undertaken “the first and
systematic programme on analysis and research of the Linear B documents”
(Ventris 1958: 72), also her suggestion of inflection and the sign for “total”
are mentioned. In the Ventris/Chadwick book Documents in Mycenaean
Greek, published in 1956, the same year Michael Ventris died in a car acci5 “After the war, when he [Michael Ventris] had completed his training as an architect, he
returned to it [Linear B] with renewed vigour. At the beginning of 1950 he took the unusual
step of circulating a questionnaire to a group of dozen scholars of international reputation,
whom he knew to be actively working on the Minoan scripts. […] The ten scholars who
sent answers were Bennett (U.S.A.), Bossert and Grumach (Germany), Schachermeyr
(Austria), Pugliese Carratelli and Peruzzi (Italy), Georgiev (Bulgaria), Ktistopolus
(Greece), Sundwall (Finland), and Myres (Great Britain)” (Chadwick 1967: 47).

dent in the north of London, the presentation of Alice’s scholarly achievements towards the decipherment are presented as follows:
‘In attempting to decipher documents written in an unknown language with an unknown script, the first step is to establish the facts
that are obvious from an inspection of the available documents. The
second step in the decipherment is to find, by careful analysis and logical deduction, what conclusions can be drawn from these fundamental facts.’ This prim but necessary programme, purposely stopping short of the third and crucial step (the attempt to substitute actual sounds and words), was undertaken by Alice Kober of Brooklyn
in a series of fundamental articles on Linear B published between
1943 and her premature death in 1950. (Ventris/Chadwick 1973
[1956]: 15)
Even though omitting the source of the quotation and abridging the original text without indication (the first sentence is the opening sentence of
Kober’s 1945 article Evidence of Inflection in the ‘Chariot’ Tablets from
Knossos, the second sentence opens the third paragraph of the same article),
Kober’s work is acknowledged as “fundamental” but not crucial: as Margalit Fox (in the first comprehensive book about Evans, Myres, Kober,
Ventris and Linear B, The Riddle of the Labyrinth) portrays the process of
decipherment, it was Alice Kober’s study of the inflection that unlocked, ultimately, the path towards the decipherment:
Now that he’d [Ventris] been through the Pylos data, he realized
something vital: While it contained many ‘triplets’ of the kind Kober
had identified, the specific triplets she had isolated were found only
in Knossos. […] Perhaps, Ventris conjured in early 1952, the words
found exclusively there [at Knossos] were the name of Cretan towns.
With that in mind, he tried the following experiment: Ventris homed
in on the simplest forms in Kober’s paradigm […]. By making ‘only
a little adjustment’ to his grid, as he told Myres, he was able to plug
in reasonable guesses for the values of [the signs. …] What Ventris
wound up with looked an awful lot like the Greek names, spelled
syllabically, for the three major towns of Cretan antiquity: Amnisos,
Tulissos, and Knossos. (Fox 2013: 231)
──

The Feminist Angle
It does not come as a surprise that Fox tells about this process from a
perspective that is extremely sympathetic to Alice Kober: her book portrays
all three key figures in the Linear B decipherment. Sir Arthur Evans (dubbed
“the digger”), Dr. Alice Kober (“the detective”, alluding to her favourite
way to spend free time: reading detective novels), and Michael Ventris (“the
architect”). The chapters dedicated to Alice Kober (4­9) are the first ever
biography about the American scholar and Fox, who was the first journalist
to research in the archive at PASP, had set out to bring Alice Kober and her
work back to the attention of classicists and the broader public. “I RESCUE
lost souls” is how she opens her article in the New York Times about “The
Riddle of the Labyrinth”, connecting her work as an obituary writer in that
very newspaper with Alice Kober, whose obituary at the time didn’t account
for her extraordinary scholarly work and who was subsequently, according
to Fox, “lost to history”:
Little did I realize six years ago, when I began work on a new
book about the decipherment of an ancient script, that I would encounter the greatest backstage player I have ever written about: a
woman who helped illuminate a world that flourished 3,000 years
ago. […] In the mid­20th century, though hardly anyone knew it, Dr.
Kober, working quietly and methodically at her dining table in Flatbush, helped solve one of the most tantalizing mysteries of the modern age. […] Like so many canonical narratives of achievement, this
story has a quiet backstage figure behind the towering public one.
And here, too, as in other such stories […], that figure is a woman.
[… To] correct a gaping omission in the story of one of the world’s
great intellectual puzzles and to narrate a vital piece of American
women’s history, I have chosen to reconstitute this singular unsung
heroine at length, at last. (Fox 2013a)
The unsung heroine who helped decode Linear B: the BBC News
Magazine echoed Fox’s stance in the title of an article about Alice Kober’s
──
85
role in the decipherment, published on the occasion of Fox’s book release in
June 2013:
When a British architect finally cracked it in the 1950s, he was
hailed as a genius—but he may never have succeeded had it not been
for a woman on the other side of the Atlantic. […] Alice Kober was
on the verge of deciphering Linear B. But before she could, she fell
ill, suddenly, and died soon after. […] Still, she left behind, in her
academic publications, a sturdy bridge for others to cross. And in
1952, Michael Ventris did. In a lecture after he had cracked Linear
B, and before his death, Ventris did however give substantial credit
to Kober for her contribution—but this acknowledgement went
largely unnoticed. (Gallafent 2013)
As I have shown above, Ventris and Chadwick gave her credit in their
first publication on Linear B, and Chadwick also mentions Alice Kober in
his monograph about the decipherment which he first published in 1958. He
begins the paragraph about her findings in a praising voice—as far as I can
see after having gone through all the accounts of the decipherment in which
she appears, this is the only time “Miss Kober” is properly addressed as “Dr.
Alice E. Kober”:
The most valuable contribution came a little later (1943­50),
from the American Dr. Alice E. Kober. She died at the early age of
forty­three in 1950, just too soon to witness and take part in the decipherment for which she had done so much to prepare the way. She
was the first to set out methodically to discover the nature of the language through the barrier of the script. (Chadwick 1967: 35)
Later in the same paragraph he comments on the term “Kober triplets”,
which was coined by Michael Ventris in a rather blunt (Robinson calls it
“slightly teasing” (2002: 69)) manner: the childless Miss discovers different
sets of three inscriptions, a discovery that was destined to outlive her. Alas,
these must be the children she didn’t have in her life: by stating that they are
“now commonly, and irreverently” known as such, Chadwick is expressing
a certain regret for this unfortunate fact. Maybe he himself could have prevented this from happening, this is what comes to my mind, the mind of a
later­born, by editing the passage in Documents in Mycenaean Greek, where
──
86
the term triplets is used without quotation marks or comment (Ventris/Chadwick 1956: 16), giving it an established character. Apart from the casual use
of the term triplets, Kober is mentioned (maybe not at length, but still with
respect and recognition for her work, or so it seems to me) in both key publications on Linear B. In Chadwick’s 1987 introductory book for the British
Museum Linear B and related scripts, he reinforces Kober’s influence by
stating:
The most important step, seen with hindsight, was the discovery
by the American scholar Alice Kober of a number of sign­groups at
Knossos which occurred in three different forms, which she thought
must represent some sort of inflexional endings. (Chadwick 1989
[1987]: 17)
In the Ventris Papers at the Institute of Classical Studies (IoCS), there is
a 1955 typescript for a BBC radio documentary under the title Tonge of the
Heroes (IoCS, MV 054.1­37, first draft, and ­50, second draft) which was
broadcast after Ventris’ death in 1958 under the title Language of the Heroes
(see correspondence between BBC and Lois Ventris in the Ventris Papers,
IoCS, MV 083.1­3). In this script, Ventris dedicated a section to Kober’s
achievements. Originally he proposed including quotations from her articles, but these passages were erased—either by Ventris himself or the BBC
editor. What was left is the following:
We began to realize we’d been working in a hopelessly unmethodical way. New discipline came from lead given by Dr. Alice Kober
(worked 1944 to death 1950). Her three important contributions: (1)
Drawing up a list of signs […] (2) recognizing inflections […] (3)
Evidence from inflection enables you to construct the ‘grid’. (IoCS
MV 054.1­37)
He also takes the time to mention the other scholars who were working
on the problem of the decipherment. So perhaps, in the first transmission of
The Cretan Tablets from 1952, time had indeed been scarce. Ventris and
Chadwick both were aware of Kober’s achievements, and praised them publicly.

87
That is to say, Alice Kober is not an unsung heroine, after all, but I guess
the singing about her is pretty soft. So the task would be to turn up the
volume? Or did I overlook any major publications in which Dr. Alice Kober
wasn’t mentioned, mistakenly?
I think Myres, old and tired as he must have been when the manuscript
was finally with the printer, didn’t mention her in Scripta Minoa II, the longanticipated publication of the Knossos tablets, that Arthur Evans had passed
down to him, for which Alice Kober did so much, unpaid and despite her
worsening health. But when I open the heavy volume—right there, in
between the narrow library shelves, to convict Myres in the very act, I read:
Thanks […] to Dr. Alice Kober, of Brooklyn College, New York,
who came twice to Oxford to study unpublished texts, revised the
Vocabulary, contributed the Inventory of tablets according to their
contents, read the proofs, and contributed many valuable suggestions. She was ready to go also to Crete, if the Candia Museum had
been restored as to make the original tablets accessible. After the
lamented death of Dr. Kober on 16 May 1950, Dr. Emmett Bennett,
Jr., of Yale University most kindly visited the reopened museum,
checked the numeration of the tablets, and rejoined tome unregistered fragments. (Evans 1952: vi)

Encyclopaedias and Anthologies
To be fair, how important is it to be acknowledged in somebody else’s
book? One has to be written about on one’s own behalf. So I keep checking:
Alice Kober is mentioned in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, though in the
entry on Arthur Evans, not in the one about Ventris (but neither John Chadwick, John Myres or Emmett Bennett have their own entry, or are mentioned
in others) and maybe it was a late addendum, sparked by Fox’s book:
(Ventris—with the aid of Cambridge linguist John Chadwick
[1920–98] and building on the painstaking work of Brooklyn College Classics professor Alice E. Kober [1906–50]—later presented
evidence that Linear B was a form of Greek, and his proposal was
widely accepted.)6
There is no entry for Kober in the Encyclopedia Americana. In the German Brockhaus Lexikon there are two Kobers: Leopold, an Austrian geologist, who did research on continental crust and Zwischengebirge (in between
mountains), and Theodor, an aviation engineer, the first employee of Graf
Zeppelin, it seems. Nevertheless, Alice wasn’t lost in the mountains in
between time: since February 20067
 she has had an entry on Wikipedia, stating that she was “best known for extensive investigations that eventually led
to the decipherment of Linear B”. Given that the Palaima/Trombley newspaper article Archives Revive Interest in Forgotten Life (2003) is listed as the
only source, it might have sparked the creation of the entry, which was substantially improved in 2013, after The Riddle of the Labyrinth was published.

Alice Kober is not included in the book Breaking Ground. Pioneering
Women Archaeologists (Joukowsky/Getzel 2004), but in the online collection that was conceptualised as the publication’s sequel: Breaking Ground:
Women in Old World Archaeology8
. The three page biography gives a solid
overview of Kober’s life, although not all the facts are correctly portrayed:
Kober never “studied first hand, the inscriptions at Knossos” (p. 3), and she
wasn’t “research assistant at the Minoan Research Center for the University
Library at the University of Pennsylvania” (p. 4)—this was the centre she
and Franklin Daniel wanted to create, inspired by Johannes Sundwall, to
collect all the Linear B material and keep it in a safe space (Sundwall was,
given the Iron Curtain, constantly worried of another war. See quotation
from the Mid­Century Report below). After Franklin’s death, Alice Kober
pursued the installation of the Minoan Research Center (in which she would
have worked, unpaid, at the weekends), but because of her illness it never
operated.
Alice Kober is, however, included in Notable American Women 1607­
1950 (James et al. 1971: 344). In a text written by Emmett Bennett, she is
presented as a “classical scholar and linguist, important in the decipherment
of the Minoan script ‘Linear B’” as her findings lead “directly to Michael
Ventris’ successful decipherment”. The same biography is reprinted in the
Lexicon Grammaticorum: Who’s Who in the History of World Linguistics
(Stammerjohann 1996).

On the Decipherment and Linear B
In Archaeological Decipherment. A Handbook by Jane Barber (1974),
which focuses on methodologies in the process of deciphering different ancient languages, Alice Kober is mentioned a few times and praised in two
footnotes for her logical deduction work: “Her logic was excellent in terms
of semantics” (p. 165) and “to see how far one can deduce useful evidence
from such classified alternations alone, see Alice Kober, AJA, 49 (1954)
143­51. Note particularly her excellent methodological guidelines” (p. 174).
Chapter Nine of Maurice Pope’s book The Story of Decipherment. From
Egyptian hieroglyphs to Maya script (1975) is called Kober, Ventris, and
Linear B, and opens with the following lines (after a cautious warning that
the decipherment is “not yet absolutely certain”):
The credit for its accomplishment belongs to Michael Ventris
[…]. But the first and most difficult steps along that path were taken
by an American, Alice Kober. It was one thing to suggest that the
writing on the Linear B tablets might conceal an inflected language.
It was quite another to establish definite patterns of inflection. This
is what Miss Kober did. Her work on the script is contained in a
series of firm and penetrating articles which appeared from 1943 to
1950. (Pope 1975: 159)
In his chapter The Decipherment of Linear B contributed to A Companion to Linear B (Duhoux/Davies 2008), Pope alludes to three of Kober’s articles: two about the inflection (1945 and 1946) and the one from 1949 in
which she showed that the form of “total” can differ according to gender.
But the way he introduces Alice Kober is rather sober, not explicitly stating
her role for the decipherment: “Its potential [Evans’ ideas about inflection]
was recognised by an American scholar, Alice Kober” (Pope 2008: 3).

The exhibition Codebreakers and Groundbreakers at The Fitzwilliam
Museum in Cambridge, 2017/18 brought together two positions of cracking
code: “those involved in breaking the Second World War codes and those
who deciphered the ancient script of Linear B”.9
 These two positions are not
entirely separate narratives, given that Emmett Bennett worked as a cryptographer for the U.S. Army in WWII. In the publication accompanying the
exhibition (Galanakis et al. 2017), Alice Kober’s work is briefly introduced
in the chapter The Decipherment: People, Process, Challenges by Anna P.
Judson, who furthermore highlighted Alice Kober’s scholarly significance in
a blog post addressed to non­specialists on her personal blog It’s All Greek
to Me: “As today is International Women’s Day, I want to celebrate the woman without whose work it’s not an exaggeration to say my field of research
might well not even exist today: Alice E. Kober.”10 Judson revisits the comparison of Alice Kober to Rosalind Franklin, and comes to the same conclusion I reached: “I don’t think this is entirely fair: her contributions have always been made clear in works written about the decipherment by specialists. […] However, it is certainly true that Kober is not well­known outside
of specialist circles, and that she deserves to be better known.”

Changing the Tune
Given that almost all the relevant publications on Linear B and its decipherment mention Alice Kober, I wondered for a long time where the unsung heroine impression came from. It couldn’t simply be prompted by the
fact that she isn’t known to a broader audience today. After all, she was not
the one who managed to crack the script, how could she be known better? I
still can’t tell for sure how this notion came into being, but I suppose it has
—or could have—something to do with the press articles breaking news of
the decipherment. Going through the newspaper clipping folders in the Michael Ventris Papers (IoCS, MV 075.1­52), my spirits dampened: not in one
of the 52 articles from all over Europe and the US was Alice Kober’s contribution mentioned. The image of Michael Ventris as the brilliant mastermind
who has, in a triumphant act of volition, solved one of mankind’s great mysteries is the story reported by journalists. A story in which Ventris becomes a
WWII cryptographer, because it suits the narrative. A story in which Ventris
suddenly understood that Linear B was a syllabic script, Ventris who did the
sign­frequency analysis, Ventris who discovered the inflection, like in the
Time Magazine article Tale of Two Palaces from 19 April 1954 (p. 72):
At first Ventris also favored the idea that the tablets were
Minoan. That being the case, he had few hints as to their meaning,
except for the tiny pictures (e.g. a horse’s head, a chariot, a cup) that
accompanied some of the text. Otherwise, the writing seemed to
consist of about 88 ‘signs’, each one apparently denoting a syllable.
With the help of Cambridge Philologist John Chadwick, Ventris
began experimenting. He counted the frequencies of various signs,
tried to determine how often they might appear at the beginning, the
middle, or the end of words. Then he began to investigate the various
changes in word endings, and found that they seemed to follow certain rules of grammar much like those of Greek.
──
93
While it is true that John Chadwick supported him, the timeline is
wrong: Chadwick didn’t work with Ventris until he had first put out his hypothesis that Linear B was used to write Ancient Greek. And, clearly, the
endings were discovered by Alice Kober.
As a copywriter, a part of me understands why Alice Kober’s achievements were omitted in the articles: in order to keep the story straight and focused, easy to follow for a non­specialist audience. But the amount of misinformation and attributions found in the articles about the decipherment
can’t be explained with the simplification of a story. It seems to be an almost violently disrespectful rewriting of the narrative in order to place
Ventris at the centre of the achievement, ignoring all the other scholars who
worked on the problem (apart from Chadwick, as mentioned, and Blegen)
for decades. What was a story of many, and could have been presented as a
joint effort across continents, overcoming the discontinuation of intellectual
exchange caused by the war, is instead reduced to that of one man, one
mind. Like the summit of Mount Everest, which was accomplished in 1953,
when Ventris published the results of the decipherment. In The Times of 25
June 1953, both achievements are even placed on the same page: three men
alone, against the known world and its order.
Regarding the newspaper articles, the assessment of Alice as an unsung
heroine is absolutely right. She had, at the time of the decipherment, never
been shown to the public. In the context of the books and articles about Linear B, it might be more a matter of turning up the volume, or better yet, of
changing the tune. When going through all the passages in which Alice
Kober is mentioned, the sentences praising her “excellent logic” are in many
cases (all written by male authors) ironed out by words like “prim”, “arid”,
“cold”, “ponderous”. Even the word “frigid” came up. The fiercest judgement of Alice Kober is to be found in The Man Who Deciphered Linear B.
Take, for example, in the following passage, which Fox must have had in
──
94
mind when she wrote her version of the correlations of the decipherment, almost rectifying Alice Kober’s reputation:
In mid­June 1951, on this topic [inflection] he [Ventris] wrote: ‘It
is possible to disagree here and there on whether a particular pair of
sign groups really are inflected forms of the same word; but the basic existence of inflection, hinted at by Evans and confirmed with
rather ponderous logic by Kober, is now beyond doubt. I must admit
though, that at the time of Kober’s articles on the subject I was inclined to follow Myres in dismissing most of her evidence for inflection as being merely alternative name endings’ […]. By late August,
he [Ventris] was willing to be more definite still: ‘the large and very
interesting body of evidence which can be extracted from them [the
Pylos sign groups] makes the presence of inflection, first demonstrated by Kober, a certainty.’ In due course, Ventris would be prepared to give the late American scholar further credit for her work in
inflection, but he would never be warm in his praise. And given the
consistent cold shoulder he had received from her throughout, even
before her illness, one does not feel inclined to criticise him.
(Robinson 2002: 90)
One does not? Well, in fact I do, and I also am inclined to criticise the
author’s commenting voice. Allegedly, Kober and Ventris met in Oxford in
1948, as Myres had asked them both to help him with the publication of
Scripta Minoa, Ventris was supposed to make the drawings of the tablets,
but Ventris left abruptly and bailed out of the project. He apologised to
Myres in a quite tumultuous letter, stating he was a swine for letting Myres
down, but having come to the conclusion he should stick to his last. Even
though it is unknown what really happened that night, it tends to be interpreted against Kober, as Ventris later told his wife he “had a terrible row”
(Robinson 2002: 61). I’ll explore this incident in depth in chapter 9.
More weight in judging Alice Kober’s personality has her reply to
Ventris’ so called Mid­Century Report, probably because it is still visible,
typewriter on paper. At the end of 1949 Michael Ventris distributed a set of
21 questions to twelve scholars who were working on the decipherment.
Their scope ranged from general to specific, and the aim was to bring to­
──
95
gether all the knowledge and theories about Linear B at the time. After having received the answers, Ventris translated where necessary, then compiled
and copied the answers and distributed them to the participants (for a facsimile of the whole report see Ventris 1988). Against her usual policy of corresponding even with annoying people11, Alice Kober replied on 20 February 1950 that she thought this questionnaire was a waste of time and a step
in the wrong direction. This is presented in the literature, for example like,
this:
Alice Kober herself refused to reply, saying it was a waste of
time and (rather oddly) a step in the wrong direction. She can hardly
have meant by this that collaboration was in itself undesirable. Perhaps she felt that many of Ventris’ questions would only encourage a
priori speculations as to what the answers would be. (Pope 1975: 8)
Or like this: “She [Miss Kober] replied briefly that she thought the questionnaire was a waste of time; but this rebuff did not prevent Ventris from
establishing friendly relations with her” (Chadwick 1976: 48). The Chadwick account, which has surely been the basis for all following renderings
of the relationship between Ventris and Kober is, strangely enough, misleading: How could Ventris establish friendly relations with a person who would
die four months later and, due to her health, couldn’t write letters anymore?
Chadwick, in twisting the order of events, laid the ground for the perception of Ventris as the dedicated, warm person, while Kober is the icy one.
In going back to the actual report, we can see that Ventris added, under
Alice’s reply, a reference to her seminal paper about the Minoan scripts:
“(For a recent assessment of the present state of research, see Miss Kober’s
‘The Minoan Scripts: fact and theory’ (AJA 52 1948 p 82 ff).” We can also
see that while some scholars indeed wrote lengthy replies (Pugliese Carratelli peaks with 13.5 pages), Alice Kober wasn’t the only one who kept it
11 “I consider myself an expert on crack­pots. Everytime I’ve published anything, I got two
or three letters from people who explained how simple the problem was. Then would ensue
an active correspondence for a month or so, with my correspondent getting more and more
annoyed with my ‘stolid classicism‘ or my ‘unscientific conservatism‘ until I stopped
answering.” (AK to FD, 4 September 1946, PASP, Box 57).

short: Emmett Bennet a little over 1 page, Myres 1.5 pages and Sundwall 2
pages. In fact, reading Sundwall’s 28 January 1950 answer to the last question of the set “Q21, WORK FOR THE FUTURE—What (apart from full
publication of the records) do you consider the most important work to be
undertaken in the future?” is as telling as it is touching:
The most important task for the present seems to me to be that of
using Miss Kober’s classification list to draw up surveys of the
Knossos inventory records of their contents. […] I do not know how
far Myres has got with the printing. I have unfortunately not heard
from Miss Kober for some time. She wrote last autumn that she was
to undergo an operation: I am afraid she is not better yet. She is
really the pole around which the whole of Myres’s work of editing
has revolved. One has come to place reliance on her painstaking
work with the texts, and she is perhaps more than anyone else familiar with them and with the formulae peculiar to the lists. […] With
best wishes for a successful 1950, and in the hope that we shall not
be prevented, by the critical state of the world and by the threat of
atomic, hydrogen and other bombs, from being able to continue to
work together on the problems which science has set us. (Sundwall
quoted in Ventris 1988: 86)
The reason for Kober’s silence is already given in the report then: just
none of the writers turning it against her had bothered to follow the lead. Or
is it, in terms of contrasts in the story, convenient to have an antagonist who
puts pressure on the protagonist and makes him shine even more brilliantly?
Although he [Ventris] undoubtedly learned from her [Alice
Kober’s] work and would later praise some aspects, he never went
back on his basic view that she was too negative about the prospects
of a decipherment. Surely, she did go too far in her article [Kober
1948]. No science, and certainly no archaeological decipherment,
proceeds on such arid, all­or­nothing basis. […] Alice Kober was
probably too restrained a scholar to have ‘cracked’ Liner B. In the
published words of Ventris written after the decipherment, her approach was ‘prim but necessary’ (privately, he told another American
woman scholar that Kober’s logic was ‘a shade too frigid and destructive for my taste!’). To go further would require a mind like his,
that combined her perseverance, logic and method with a willingness
to take intellectual risks. (Robinson 2002: 72)

Instead of protesting this representation myself, I would like to re­quote
Prof. Palaima, who has studied and worked with Emmett Bennett and is besides being a Linear B expert an enthusiastic Alice Kober supporter:
‘Kober has tended to be presented as a harsh, suffer­no­fools,
kind of character,’ says Prof Thomas Palaima, head of the Program
in Aegean Scripts and Prehistory at the University of Texas at Austin, which holds Kober’s archives. ‘But this reputation is unfair,’ he
says. ‘Her papers show her to be a thoughtful, kind and dedicated
person, who, for example, converted test papers for a student who
was blind into Braille (which she mastered). She has a fine sense of
humour,’ says Palaima. ‘There’s an amazing amount of whimsical
stuff in there.’ (Gallafent 2013)
I couldn’t agree more with him, even in the published articles, to me,
there is whimsical stuff. For example, Kober built her 1944 article The
Scripts of Pre­Hellenic Greece on the ancient Greek saying “All Cretans are
liars”. While its origin is unknown, Kober says that in classical times the
Greeks used to comment on the Cretans’ claims that “Crete had once ruled
the Aegean, when every Greek knew it was an island of little political or
commercial importance, and quite outside the current of Greek civilization;
finally, to cap the climax, the Cretans asserted that they had invented writing, when every school child knew that Cadmus had brought writing to
Greece, and that Cadmus was a Phoenician!” (Kober 1944: 72). After giving
an overview of the Minoan Scripts and the basic problems of the decipherment, she concludes: “We can say only one thing with certainty: the ancient
Greeks did the Cretans an injustice. All Cretans were not liars” (Kober
1944: 74). Opening up an alternative narrative to Greek prehistory by rehabilitating the Cretan’s reputation shows a thinker far from cold or rigid—it is
a funny, thorough and gentle way of thinking about the past and what of it is
knowable to us. And Kober is, even in this light­footed frame for her article,
cautious. She doesn’t reach her point by stating “Cretans weren’t liars”, but
“All Cretans were not liars. They sometimes told the truth”—a proposition
that is unquestionably true, given her previous elaborations. Given her language’s accuracy and strict refusal of conjecture, it seems doubly unfair that
──

she herself is subject to speculation and looseness, that many of the texts
about her are biased and thus the sources aren’t read carefully: care not only
as a concern or worry, but also diligence and welfare.
In her first article about inflection (1945) she underlines how jumping to
conclusions easily can cause misunderstandings:
It is obvious that, in any language written in an alphabet or syllabary, a certain number of words can be found that have many signs
in common and still are not related—e.g. in English, the pairs
‘heavy’ and ‘heaven’; ‘berry’ and ‘merry’ each have four signs in
common. Yet they are not related, although a careless alien might
conclude that they showed suffixal and prefixal inflection respectively. (Kober 1945: 144)
I cannot know if she meant alien in the sense of “a foreign person” or of
“an extraterrestrial being”, but every time I read these lines, I see a greenish
jelly­creature from outer space putting on a row of 13 reading glasses (its
eyes are dry from the long journey and also a bit tired) with an almost inaudible pebbly exhale, bending over a hard drive or newspaper scrap, determined to find out what this vanished civilisation was once communicating. Because where careless aliens exist, there also must be careful ones,
right? But, more importantly, how does the careful alien examine and write
about what is only to be found between the lines?

Turning to Fiction
There is, to my knowledge, only one work of fiction in which Alice
Kober is featured: Alison Fell’s novel The Element ­inth in Greek (2012).
The title is taken from a Kober manuscript (PASP, Boxes 52, 53). She published an excerpt of her findings in the 1942 article The Gender of Nouns
Ending in ­inthos. Franklin Daniel wanted to publish the whole study in
1947 as a book (FD to AK 11 September 1947, PASP, Box 57), but it never
materialised. The blurb of Fell’s book opens:
In a small holiday village on the coast of Crete, Ingrid Laurie researches a biography of the neglected linguist Alice Kober, who laid
the basis for the decipherment of the ancient Cretan script Linear B,
but died too young to reap the rewards of her work. While Ingrid
struggles to decipher the life of the enigmatic scholar, on the outskirts of the village local policeman Yannis Stephanoudakis discovers a bizarre, naked corpse covered in honey and dead bees.
It is a kind of detective novel in which the fictional biographer, Ingrid
Laurie, is 43 years old, just as Alice Kober was when she died. Laurie is divorced and only entertained by books or when talking to others about her research. She falls for the policeman (and helps him with the case by going
through a manuscript of the deceased young man), but doesn’t want to allow
him any space in her life. In the end, she has to return home from Crete
early to take care of her frail mother (another distant Kober parallel) and
eventually commits to Yannis’ courting from a distance.
Loosely scattered into the murder case narrative are passages about
Alice Kober’s life, which are the results of Ingrid’s research stays in Texas,
New York and Greece: Alice Kober’s education and decision to decipher linear B (p. 2­4), that her birth certificate listed Alice as Adele (p. 42), the dif­
──
100
ferent places of residence of the Kober family over time and the unknown
cause of death (p. 47­51), the Kober archive and especially the contents of
the Brann memoir (p. 90­7), the unpublished monograph about the element
­inthos and Franklin Daniel (p. 103­5), Linear A (p. 120­1), Alice’s first
journey to England and Sundwall’s idea for a Minoan research institute (p.
146­150), Kober’s candidacy for the Indo­European Linguistics post at the
University of Pennsylvania and her malaise at the Christmas Convention of
the American Philological Association, the Archaeological Institute and the
Linguistic Society of America in 1947 (p. 170­5), her correspondence with
Johannes Sundwall (p. 188­191), Kober’s second trip to England, the alleged encounter with Ventris in Oxford and establishing an exchange with
Bennett (p. 292­5), work on Scripta Minoa II and Franklin Daniel’s sudden
death (p. 322­6), and Kober’s illness, exhaustion and death (p. 393­8).
Essentially, the information given in these passages is the same as Margalit Fox uses in the chapters on Kober, as both rely heavily on the Kober
correspondences at PASP, notably the Brann memoir, a 1948 student of
Kober’s who was invited by Prof. Palaima to write down her memories of
Kober, in which she gives the only existing physical description of her
(Brann Memoir, PASP, Box 58.1). Even though Fell’s text is clearly a piece
of fiction, the passages about Kober are, following the main character’s task
of writing a biography, as non­fictional as possible. Only in very select situations does the main character allow herself an imaginative tone to think
about Alice, and then only to immediately censor herself. One example is
the image of Alice Kober at the ’47 Christmas Convention—Franklin Daniel
had told her to make an impression on certain post­bearers from Penn, because he knew they needed a little persuasion to make Kober a candidate for
the professorship. Apparently, Alice didn’t have the chance to talk to them
or Franklin Daniel as he always was in conversation with others, when she
saw him, as she mentions in a letter to him on 15 February 1948. Kober’s
tone in the letter is not reproachful, it seems to me to be more like an apo­
──
101
logy or explanation to Daniel as to why she didn’t talk to him (despite all
the communication that had gone back and forth between them in the
months prior, due to Daniel’s plan to get her appointed). Ingrid Laurie imagines the situation quite differently, pitying Alice Kober for being passive,
overlooked and somewhat powerless:
[…] it’s the thought of Alice the wallflower that makes her
shiver. Ingrid imagines her in something mauve, her hands clasped
before her waist, a clunky handbag like the Queen’s dangling from
her wrist. Her hair bobbed and permed, perhaps, for the big occasion, it’s enough to make you weep. Invisible Alive, waiting and
watching, and never being seen. No one likes to go unnoticed, and
sallow, stocky Alice didn’t have glamour on her side. Impossible not
to empathise with her as she hangs about, excluded, and finally,
gathering the rags of her pride, flees from the convention. Did Alice
actually feel any of the emotions she imputes to her? She’ll never
know, of course, and empathy or no empathy, she has no right to fill
in the gaps. It’s supposed to be a biography, not a fairy tale […].
(Fell 2012: 176)
The lack of insight into Alice Kober’s life is also of importance in the
passage where Ingrid Laurie contemplates if the cancer type Alice Kober
died of (even though the cause of death is not recorded in the death certificate, it is quite certain that Alice Kober died of cancer; see Adelaide Hahn’s
obituary, PASP, Box 56.23) was of a gynaecological origin, as Kober had to
suppress her feminine side:
The speculation will have to go, of course. The trouble is that
bare statistics don’t make a life, and in the absence of proof—she
would have killed for a fragment of diary, a single personal letter—
her mind piles supposition on conjecture, racing around like a rat in
the trap. (Fell 2012: 51)
I do not know what the original intention of Alison Fell’s book was:
writing a detective story or writing a Kober biography (at the same time that
Margalit Fox wrote hers, which is an odd coincidence) or interlacing both,
but for the result this doesn’t matter. Even though Alice Kober appears in a
book of fiction, the means of fiction have not been used to explore Alice
──
102
Kober’s correspondence. As (almost) no material other than what is already
in the archive exists, re­visiting the available documents with a different
methodology is the only approach that is left to make a life. Well, maybe not
making, as that sounds like an imposition from the beginning, but retrieving
a life, versions and possibilities of a life that had once been lived.
Before elaborating on the difficulties this endeavour brought about, I
must comment on the difficulty I had with The Element ­inth in Greek,
simply because it cannot remain unsaid: in several passages there were more
or less unconcealed ethnic discriminations to be found. In many cases
against Germans, which is manifested in the use of Nazi vocabulary by Yannis (the worst is when Yannis thinks of a German character with an artificial
leg as “steel­rimmed Gauleiter” (Fell 2012: 330)) and even German characters, but also against people of colour. Ingrid Laurie wanted to visit Kober’s
house in Flatbush and, while standing in front of it and seeing a black man
walking out the door, she wonders why they hadn’t answered her letter in
which she had explained her request: “Most likely the current owners had
seen her letter as some kind of scam—a philologist (a whaaaat?) who deciphered ancient scripts (are you kidding me?)” (Fell 2012: 216). While I do
understand that for Greeks there are historical reasons for despising Germans (even though this opinion doesn’t seem to suit the police officer’s
backstory, who is quite cosmopolitan, as he was married to an Australian
and had lived many years abroad), I do not understand why Ingrid, Laurie
who is Scottish, also has to be racist and anti­German. As there doesn’t
seem to be a necessity for them in the text, these comments remain irritating
and misplaced.

Deciphering the Silence—Losing Skin
──
104
From the beginning on, the project about Alice was called Deciphering
the Silence. This title came to me as unquestionably as the whole material. It
just was there: the silence. The silences: a strangely tuned silence in the publications about the scholar Alice Kober, and the silence as a starting point
for my planned artistic work—what can be found if little or nothing is left? I
assumed from the beginning that I would need to “decipher” the remains—
try to understand an inherent inner logic without implying my own logic,
cautiously filling in the blanks. Little did I know how powerful the silence I
encountered would turn out to be: productive and unsettling, painful and liberating. Alice’s silence made my own silence audible, like wearing noisecancelling headphones—suddenly the own heart’s cawing drowns out turbine drumming, the universe’s judder, and all the sounds of outer friction.
──
105
This is one of my earliest memories: I am about three years old, standing
in our little town’s stationary shop, in the evening, winter. Maybe there’s a
Christmas market outside, the store is a bit crowded. The lady at the cashier
gives me a candy, Nimm2. Despite the name meaning take two I have to
choose between yellow (lemon) and orange (orange). Both flavours are
filled with the same syrup. I pick yellow. Some bite right away through to
the filling, but I hate that splintering sound. I would wait until the hard part
dissolved. Enjoying the gentle clicking sound of the hard candy against my
teeth.
“When we are home, can I get a glass of water?” I ask my Mum.
“Are you thirsty?”
“The candy got stuck.” I can hardly breathe. The cheerful yellow candy
turned into a villain, raging in the inside of my throat. And yet I do not dare
to ask for a glass of water, right now in the store, because I have already
been given a candy. I am three years old, about to suffocate, and what I care
about is not being excessive. I am three years old and I know how long the
walk back to our house is. In fact, I know every feeder pillar, all the crossroads, I know where the pistachio green house is and the sign with the
school kids on it, I could draw the different types of paving: cobble stone,
tar, concrete blocks. I am three years old and I have no voice for myself, for
my needs.

Becoming a Female Writer
Being on my journey to Alice’s archive, I thought I’d start writing about
her, writing her back into the world right there in Austin, sitting at my desk
in the cramped archive. I still thought that over my first days there. But I
was busy with carefully opening the moon­coloured archival boxes and
folders, taking out the thin postwar paper, which made it hard (especially the
type from Finland that Johannes Sundwall used) to see which letters were
written on which side—front and back inked together in immediacy. I was
busy holding my breath. Then, after I had seen, had read everything, I sat
there, eventually enveloped in the same delicate layer of dust that covered
Alice’s former belongings. I couldn’t move to write. To invent. To imagine.
To play. As it is not uncommon for me not to write even though I want to, I
wasn’t alarmed. But inevitably, the pressure built up. After all, I had only a
couple of weeks in Austin and I couldn’t spend them all motionlessly. So I
started to type up all the parts that I felt I’d need from Alice’s correspondence with Franklin Daniel and Johannes Sundwall. Alice’s voice went
through my fingers, her rhythm of language structured my thoughts. Her
way of expressing herself in English and German. The German which was
almost perfect, but slipped from time to time. I chose these two correspondences because they seem to have meant the most to Alice: the collection of
letters exchanged with Franklin Daniel is by far the most extensive, even
with the four year long silence while he was in the Army. They are letters of
friendship, of professional inspiration, of advice, of attraction even. They
are the most personal. In the letters with Sundwall Alice is a different writer
(in the German as well as in the English ones). She admires him, caring for
him, his advice and health, across continents.
──
107
I decided to re­type—and not photograph, as I did with other letters—
for practical reasons: to get a better overview, to being able to look for specific words and terms afterwards, but also to get closer to them. To enter
them. To see what I am missing. “To write is to want to rewrite”, says
Barthes (2011 [2003]: 132).
The dance of readerly excitement: the smack of an open hand on
the desk, abrupt shifts in position, breath quickening or slowing
down. In these scenes of extraordinary encounter I realize what
Barthes describes as a lack. I am up out of my chair, or I’m not: I’m
still seated, I’m folding down the corner of the page, underlining,
typing the passage out, capturing it on my phone because even in its
plenitude, even as it is right now filling me up, there is, I feel, something missing. (Briggs 2017: 116)
Rewriting as not not writing: I was filling myself with Alice’s words.
And slowly, ever so gently, she arrived inside me or I arrived inside her. And
all the anger I had felt when she hadn’t gotten appointed as a professor in
Philadelphia, when Sir John Myres made her work for him and kept her
from her own work and she was too polite to refuse, when she talked about
how she served cocoa for her students’ classical club meeting—all that jolted my ribcage from the inside, from where the void is halted by bone, by
flesh.
Suddenly I realised that I, up to this point, had been a writer. Not female,
not male. Just a writer without a body, and I had considered it a strength. If
you have no body, you cannot be hurt, can you? You cannot suffer. You cannot bleed. “Writing is easy”, as Hemingway allegedly said, “all you do is sit
down at a typewriter and bleed.”

Speaking Silences
I was going to die, if not sooner then later, whether or not I had
ever spoken myself. My silences had not protected me. Your silence
will not protect you. But for every real word spoken, for every attempt I had ever made to speak those truths for which I am still seeking, I had made contact with other women while we examined the
words to fit a world in which we all believed, bridging our differences. (Lorde 2017 [1984]: 1)
From the beginning, this project had a certain feminine energy to it
(“Woman must write her self: must write about women and bring women to
writing. […] When I say ‘woman,’ I’m speaking of woman in her inevitable
struggle against conventional man; and of a universal woman subject who
must bring women to their senses and to their meaning in history.” Cixous
1976 [1975]: 875­6), but I didn’t call myself a feminist writer or think of
myself as a feminist. One reason is that feminism has a different notion in
Germany, probably in all German­speaking countries. For a long time feminists were deemed old, stubborn man­haters, and prominent activists like
Alice Schwarzer inevitably substantiated this prejudice, simply because she
was an activist and opposed common opinions about pornography, for example. For my whole school career, feminism was not mentioned once. No
one introduced us to the terminology, gave us the words to think about and
share our everyday life experiences.
When I was in New York, I went to readings of Laurie Penny, Roxane
Gay, Naomi Klein and Siri Hustved. There it belonged together: being a female writer and being a feminist. I think one of them even said it: I write
and I am a woman, how could I not be a feminist? In the German­speaking
literature world, it is still an exception and not a matter of course to be a
feminist. Not in a single introduction or Q&A section of a reading I have attended in the last ten years in Switzerland and Germany did the word femin­

ist come up. It seems highly unlikely now that I write it, but I have a fairly
good memory and I don’t see why it would fail me on this question, of all
things.
In 1999 the term Fräuleinwunder, which originally was coined to describe the success of the German beauty queen Susanne Erichsen in the
1950s (see Life Magazine, 7 April 1952, p.77), was attributed by literature
critic Volker Hage (1999) to young female authors who had just published
their debuts: “Das literarische Fräuleinwunder ist jedenfalls augenfällig”.
(“The literary Fräulein wonder is obvious, however.”) He goes on to call Judith Hermann’s (one of the most accomplished writers of short stories) writing “ganz hinreißend” (truly adorable), an almost violently patronising
choice of words for a book review in one of Germany’s most important print
media.
Almost ten years later, in 2008, Charlotte Roche’s book Feuchtgebiete
took up a stance on how women see themselves, their bodies, and their desires. This huge success was partly due to the fact that Charlotte Roche was,
back then, thirty years old, which undermined the image of the “old” (I cannot help the quotation marks—that capitalist logic at work: what is old has
to be replaced, recycled, up­cycled at best, but cannot, under any circumstances, be good) feminist who, out of their own bitterness condemned men.
The book provided an unspoken view on the female body (with an emphasis
on secretions) and female pleasure. Soon after it was published it was declared “the new feminism”, and this claim was in turn widely debated12.
Charlotte Roche declared herself to be a feminist (see the interview with
Nina Power in Power 2011 [2008]) and strived to inspire discussions, but
through the exaggerations in the play, with disgust and taboos, no general
discussion about the female body, sexuality, and needs unfolded, as the extreme couldn’t refer in a meaningful way to the ordinary.
12 See for example the article “Da kommt Mutter Natur” by Hubert Spiegel in Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, 16 April 2008,
https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/belletristik/erfolgsgeschichteeines­buches­da­kommt­mutter­natur­1539783.html (accessed 16 December 2019).

A more recent example of feminism in German­speaking literature is the
Austrian author Stefanie Sargnagel, who puts forth the idea of matriarchy as
a writer of status updates on Facebook, which have been published as books
too. Sargnagel is a founding member of Hysteria, a female fraternity which
is a satirical project, but leaves a quite serious impression: I saw their appearance in the audience during a reading by Stefanie Sargnagel at Volksbühne Berlin. They were in full uniform in the audience, saluting, and somehow prepared. For taking over? For finally getting it right? In this performance, as well as in Stefanie Sargnagel’s attitude as a writer (in her texts, she
cultivates the outsider attitude of an alcoholic, an art student and a call
centre agent, and maybe her brilliance lies in making all three of them work
together perfectly), there is that of boredom (see her reading at the prestigious literary award Bachmann Preis13) and decline towards the world. Recently, her twitter account was shut down because she tweeted (in a heavy
Austrian accent) after a band she was not supportive of was selected to represent Austria in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest: “Austria, you stupid
child of a bitch, I’m going to kill you”. It is a late (and probably deliberate)
echo of the image of militant feminists who are driven by hatred.
In the realm of German­speaking mainstream culture there are only in
the last couple of years voices like Roxane Gay’s to be found who advocate
a differentiated and positive feminism which does not rely on confrontation,
but implicitness and companionship, which is much harder to dismiss (Caroline Emcke and Magarete Stokowski are two of them I enjoy reading a lot).
On the contrary, there are female writers who decline feminism and are
applauded by critics and readers alike. The most recent cases that come to
my mind are Ronja von Rönne and Svenja Flaßpöhler. The latter has written
an essay (published in a pink jacket) called Die potente Frau (the potent woman) (2018) as a response to the #metoo debate, arguing that saying “no”
leaves women in the position of the weak, the victim. In making women responsible for what does or does not happen to them and considering this a
13 https://bachmannpreis.orf.at/stories/2773162/ (accessed 16 December 2019).
──
112
precious position of power, the terms of “the new femininity” are just the
same as the ones before. It is not the climate that has to change but the women’s attitude towards it: embracing it instead of demanding changes.
The blogger and journalist Ronja von Rönne, born in 1992, wrote a 2015
article for the German newspaper Die Welt entitled Warum mich der Feminismus anekelt (Why feminism disgusts me), stating, among other things, that
she, living in a country whose most powerful person has a vagina, has never
experienced being a woman as a disadvantage. That for her, it is fine if companies use naked women in ads for their products, because there seems to be
a market for it. In the last decades, Rönne writes, feminism has become a
charity mission for underprivileged women, only a symptom in a culture of
outrage that clutches more tightly to the idea of equality than any communist regime. She knows many successful women, says Rönne, none of whom
is a feminist because they’ve never seen themselves as victims.
I have to stop the quoting here. Rönne herself would probably agree
with my objection: she rejected a major journalist price for this piece (the
silver Axel Springer Preis, please allow me to translate just one more bit,
from the statutes: awarded to “journalistically outstanding work” in order to
“support prospective journalists and encourage excellency”)14 and said she
never wanted to be an antifeminist in the first place, and that some sentences
are unclear. Did she anticipate the instant popularity that would follow her
article? Today, four years later, she hosts a TV show on Arte. She is a successful woman, too.
I have to be honest: ten years ago, I was ignorant. I was aware of inequalities, I would join in my friend Kitty’s anger when she didn’t get a
Postdoc position on grounds of being in her late twenties, that is: of potentially getting pregnant and thus going on maternity leave (of course, that
wasn’t said explicitly, but wasn’t hard to guess either). I vehemently tried to
talk my sister out of getting into a relationship with her maths teacher who

was 15 years her senior—the only time ever she hung up on me (in the end,
the fact that he still lived with his mother did the job). But with regards to
what had happened to myself, it was different. I didn’t protest. I wasn’t even
angry. The logic’s blade was forged like this: if it doesn’t hurt me, I am not a
victim. If I am not a victim, I have power. If I have power, I cannot be hurt.
Ultimately: If I have overcome _________________ , _________________
can’t have happened. I guess I wasn’t and am not the only woman with this
view of my life and my experiences. It made sense: girls were not encouraged to be vulnerable. I, for one, was brought up to be neat, polite and—under the surface—persistent. My parents have told the story from the stationary store over and over again as an example how cute I was as a child. They
haven’t told it as a story about how they had failed teaching their daughter
the words to verbalise her most basic needs. They have not told it as a story
of silence. Nor any other. For which language is there to tell stories of silence? Can language protect the silence that is a shelter?
While living in New York, I read a passage in Bell Hooks’ The Will to
Change about why feminists are considered bad or hateful, while it isn’t
usually women who create an atmosphere of violence, pornography and abuse (“Even though not all men are misogynists, feminist thinkers were accurate when we stated that patriarchy in its most basic, unmediated form
promotes fear and hatred of females” Hooks 2004: 108). In this single instant of reading, a multiplicity of situations in which I had found myself,
situations including different degrees of violence, forced into action against
my will, lay spread out in front of me, neatly aligned. Moments that I had
long forgotten or belittled for years. Their very number was shocking—the
memories kept and kept on pouring out, just weeks before the #metoo debate started. I was outraged: how could so many things have happened to
me and why didn’t I ever report anything? Why, most of all, had I never felt
that my integrity had been violated, that very wrong things had happened to
me? I had to write to understand what I had experienced, I wanted to write

in order to keep the conversation going. It’s not only in Hollywood or with
actresses: it is in our very homes, in the cities and the countrysides, in
Southern Germany, and Berlin and everywhere else. I felt and feel a responsibility or obligation to tell my own story (before re­telling Alice’s),
with the faint hope that eventually the atmosphere of assault and power abuse can be transformed into a more humane, respectful and secure one. The
manuscript I worked on between summer 2017 and 2018 is a collection of
prose fragments which reach from childhood to my early thirties, revolving
around the telling of stories of silence. On the following pages, I present an
excerpt of Losing Skin, translated to English. The book will be published in
2021 by a publishing house specialised in experimental prose.

Losing Skin—Excerpt
Games
You are four
and enjoy playing most
if you’re on your own
this concerns your parents
because kids
normally do
like to be
with other kids
they say
and invite
Torsten over
your mother
lends him an old
pair of her slippers
which looks silly
but you don’t say that
out loud
you go to the bathroom
and put toothpaste
on the brush
you let water run
over it
and then there is
the pink taste
──
116
in your mouth
until the foam
finally fades
and eventually
all the foam
is gone
and yet a bit later
all of the taste
and Torsten
goes to find your mother
and asks if he’s
allowed to go
home now and she
wants to know
aren’t you having
fun playing
together
and the front door
is opened and shut
and you put the
brush back into
its plastic mug
you are four and
you won out
Magic Flute
You are five and made
to attend a pantomime
class to make you come
out of your shell at last
──
117
a scenario just
in case you wished
to stay inside wasn’t
mentioned so you
find yourself amidst
a bunch of excited kids
who fight over animal
faces in the form of
rubber masks
all of them want to be
the lion the giraffe
the horse to circle
the guitar teacher’s
beautiful son as
prince Tamino
four little animals
clockwise and two
others the other way round
a foolproof
choreography thought
the teacher
and how could she
have known that
on the day of the show
one of the animals
would be sick
which just leaves you
to fulfil the glorious duty
of trotting around
kneeling Tamino
counterclockwise

unflinching and proud
you little introvert

You’re hiding
your mother’s
keychain a white
leather case with
of a set of golden
hooks inside at the
beginning you only
rediscovered it after she
had mislaid it
forgotten
in all the fuss
about your baby
brother the gratitude
in her eyes the case
in her hand
was for you only thereupon
you tipped the odds in
your favour from time to
time and now you’re fishing
the key case out of the
neighbours’ hedge
and your mother
knows with
──
119
absolute certainty
that she can’t have left
it there in the dangling branches
maternal amnesia yes but
insanity no you
are pointing at
your brother because
you also realise
this time you’ve gone
too far embarrassed
your mother
picks up your brother
her hand with the case
supports the
small of his back
and leaves
Fabric
While
your brother grows
and becomes more and more
awake and laughs you see in
your parents eyes
how a child should be
impetuous unafraid
not stuffed with questions
would everyone be better
off without you

to find that out
you pack your sleeping

go through
the patio door
very quietly as
always you sneak
around the
house past the kitchen
window you walk
to the
crossroads there
you wait for a long time
although the light is
green is you feel
free red free
green free red then
you realise
that you are
a child that this plan
won’t work out
you get sad and relieved
at once green you turn
around to find
your way

out of your dressing up
box it’s smooth with blue
checks you put it
around your neck
holding with each hand
one of the ends
you pull as much
as you can
but there‘s something
inside of you that
suddenly gets loud
and
rages
a need
that’s not made by
the head
the head does nothing
but feeling heavy

pressing against the
eyes the power of
the rage is greater than
the power in your

and you know
from now on that

Writing Losing Skin was a journey into my own life, into the far corners
of my memory. This project is closely connected to this research, as I, before reading about autoethnography, always refused to write directly about
──
129
myself. I don’t think that it was a lack of rigour, which kept me from doing
so, but the feeling that it wouldn’t be legitimate or of interest to share my
personal stories. Why would others care? Reading autoethnographies and
exploring how they transformed me made me experience the power of real
life stories. What is told is of interest precisely because it has happened to a
human being and it is being told. Even though I am very visible in these
texts, at least two literary strategies helped me to be contained in them instead of being exposed: firstly, there’s the you­perspective, which during the
writing process was my own inner voice recalling the events, but now is directed at the reader. Secondly, there is shock and insecurity embedded in the
language, indirectly expressing my feelings—numerous line breaks which at
times (at least in the German originals) destabilise the syntax. When looking
back on the writing process, it feels as though it was expressly the tone of a
lyrical stumble that enabled me to continue with the project, balancing
between restraint and constraint. It inscribed the decades of speechlessness
into the text, and took the pressure from me to find adequate words to communicate my memories and feelings which cannot possibly exist. The hardship of witnessing and writing about assaults was made bearable by a language which incorporated and externalised the distress—a literary language.
“Who knows not how to hide, knows not how to love.”15
Who knows not how to write, knows not how to love.
Who knows not how to hide, knows not how to choke.
The playful absence of a ghostly subject as a precondition for nearness
and the quiet self­protection of a narrating subject as a precondition for accessibility. Achieving an ultimate opening towards the other through a deliberate confining of the self. Or at least through the knowledge of how the self
could disappear if necessary. In my own perceptions of my text and other
autoethnographies I have read, the impression that the author could, if they

wanted to, hide—meaning, they control their narrative, they shaped it
through active choices, not the other way round—is crucial for an effective
and not just affected reading experience. The absent present and its role in
the creation of a room for the reader and writer will be dealt with in the
chapter How to Disappear. For now, it is important to trace the two contrary
movements of showing and hiding, which are substantial for writing with a
focus on the I. Hiding is something I don’t understand as a gesture of subduction in this context, not as holding back or depriving, but as hinting or
glancing, both for the reader and the writer. For example, in this fragment of
Losing Skin, everything is said but the paint stains are, quite literally, hiding
the more painful stains:
Housewarming
You are nineteen

parents in their pumpkin seed green

like that who
also waves at
your parents and says
well kid now
they’re off

work wasn’t it and
orders Crema catalana
for you and gets you
a chair and wants
to know all about the

you the apartment quickly

what is happening here

Primke who had
drank red wine
evening after evening
with your parents
is kneeling and fumbling
his belt open and

and consequentially

shame
There had been no paint on my jumper, not on that day at least, because
we must have painted the apartment way before. But the paint saved me in
telling this story—even the bucket and what it said. This is not a memory,
but it might as well be, and it represents feelings which I remember very
well after nearly twenty years, in the most honest way I can imagine. The
paint saved me from having to write about disgust, about embarrassment,
about weakness, which is hard to do and even harder to read. It also saved
me from explicitly describing my body in the situation: it is hidden in the
jumper. The paint is the literary hideout in this text, a literally and metaphorically untouched space.
Losing Skin is thinking in writing insofar as the writing process fostered
more memories and gave them a form which is open for interrogation—
from myself and also from others. It is one possible basis to discuss the
deeply­rooted power inequalities in our society and thus complies with the
criteria for autoethnographies, that through written narratives of individuals,
light is shed on cultural phenomena. The writing has calmed and outraged
me at the same time—I am calmer in the sense of having accepted moments
in my life that before have been thoroughly unsettling. Why didn’t I say
something? Why didn’t I do something? I remembered, in the writing process, the incredibly strong disbelief that such things could happen—in general and, certainly, in those particular moments, to me. Me, a careful person
who never, not even as a child, forfeited skin or bone or flesh, because I
know my physical boundaries quite well and do not feel any desire to go
beyond them. Was it my genuine curiosity or naiveté then, that led me into
these situations? During the writing, in accumulating memories, I suddenly
felt, not only knew, that it was not my fault. That I hadn’t asked for any of
──
134
this in any way, and that I could not be blamed. This feeling was the energy
for keeping on writing.
──
135
My very earliest memory, by the way, is me sitting on the edge of my
parents’ bed. Afternoon light. My Mum is kneeling in front of me, asking
which nostril it is in. I have just shoved one of those tiny white mother­
­of­pearl buttons that she was about to sew on my Dad’s shirt’s cuff up my
nose. I have not learned how to talk yet, so I point. Sometimes, silence is all
you need to survive.

It’s snowing inside, soft flakes in all their irretrievability on the rattling
mirror’s wooden frame. On the floor, of course it is snowing on the floor,
except for the rectangular lacks of white caused by the table, the chair, the
bed. The soft border between snow and what used to be floorboards and is
now emptiness, windblown (thoughtblown, doubtblown) dispersals in the
room inside. Writing, to me, is a matter of embracing gaps and voids.
Blanks as a memorial of what cannot be told, of silence: blanks as the space
for the reader to enter a text. Blanks also as a figure of reliability, of
strength: the snow’s unflinching white encasing the words on a page.
After I had decided that my thesis had to be practice­based, that it wasn’t
only in writing, but about writing as a method, I started to reflect on the gesture, the nature, the correlations of writing itself. This process, which was
mostly inspired by Foucault, Barthes, and Irigaray, sparked ideas for writing
projects which would circle around the absent present. This chapter focuses
on the project Nebensächlich, Nomade (which consists of Savyon’s poems
in Hebrew and my transferences into German, published in spring 2020 by
Edition Solitude, Stuttgart, Germany) and shows the German versions of the
poems next to translations into English, to make them accessible in the context of the thesis.

Imagine that for you, too, there must be a sentence. A paragraph.
Or a longer part of somebody else’s work that you feel you know
well. You like it. You love it, even. Or perhaps you don’t. Perhaps it
hurts you. But you are, nevertheless, for a complex of reasons, attached to it. Let’s say that it acts upon you. […] It addresses you. Or
is it that you have made it address you? (Briggs 2017: 129)
Yes, for me, too, there is a sentence I feel I know well, that I love, even.
A sentence which acts upon me, which has inspired this whole project,
which is not one, but many. It is from the French philosopher Luce Irigaray:
The matter is no longer to simply show things to each other as
we have been taught in our culture. What we have to tell each other
is not yet determined by a discourse existing outside of us. Therefore, the first word we have to speak to each other is our capacity or
acceptance of being silent. (Irigaray 2011: 113)
The way I read it and work with it is highly selective—I leave aside the
debate of a masculinist economy/phallogocentrism (see Butler 1990) and its
connection to language. I focus on the newer texts which are more about
rapprochement between the male and female or the one and the other in general (see Irigaray 2008 and Irigaray 2017). I do, with Irigaray, understand
language as a means of power, as well as the only means of overcoming it.
Yes, for me, this is a sentence I feel I have known well, that I must have
loved from the moment of grasping language as a concept. The absence of
words as a starting point for speaking to each other invites what I would call
a poetic state of being into our cultural concept of communication—embracing blanks and blurs as the possibility of meeting the other on equal
grounds, rather than insisting on the existence of unambiguousness:
The capacity of acquiring or constructing the totality of knowledge, the totality of discourse, is often considered an accomplishment in our culture, and even the accomplishment of our culture itself. To succeed in constructing a culture of two subjects, we must
instead acquire the capacity to remain silent in order to listen to the
other as other, and to his or her truth which will always remain
strange for us, unknowable by us. Our culture lacks a cultivation of
silence as it lacks an education of relationship with the other as other. (Irigaray 2002: 85)
──
140
It’s a positive and productive silence, a silence in order to speak, not to
choke. A silence that awaits, that opens up a space to share.

When I first met Isreali poet Savyon in the communal lunch room at
Akademie Schloss Solitude in July 2018, she told me that she uses her own
texts in her pieces. Since I’m interested in how one’s own texts can be performed on stage, I asked her about her strategies and if her poems are translated into English, as I don’t speak a word of Hebrew. Savyon replied that
her texts are untranslatable, as a friend of hers told her, who had studied
Comparative Literature at Harvard and whom she had asked to try. She even
offered him money, she added, so it couldn’t have been a lack of motivation
that kept her friend from finding the right words. They just didn’t exist.
Imagine for you, too, there must be a sentence, or at least a curiosity. I
heard Alice’s verdict of semitic languages being a nuisance (“Semitic and
Egyptian are a nuisance, because they lack vowel signs, and leave too much
to the imagination”, AK to FD, 8 September 1947, PASP, Box 57) jolting
around in my thoughts. Was she right? How much is, in fact, left to the imagination in Hebrew? More than in other languages? More than in my own?
More than is bearable? I’ve never been to the Middle East and have virtually
no knowledge of Hebrew or Arabic. In experimenting with bringing Savyon’s poems into German, I saw a chance for learning about the omitted vowels, of getting to know Hebrew from an almost intimate position: being inside the language, surrounded by it, marvelling at it with my own inner
words. I also heard Luce Irigaray saying nothing. Just smiling and pointing
at the opportunity to put her idea of listening, of keeping the other’s truth,
ultimately unknowable, into action. Working with Savyon was the chance to
make a profound, honest and kind silence truly the beginning of a conversation, of an encounter between two subjects, between two writers encountering the world.
“I’m afraid my poems are untranslatable,” said Savyon, emphasising
every syllable in overcome exasperation.
──

“Let me try to translate them,” I heard myself saying, “I don’t yet know
how, but I absolutely want to try.”
“Like a bird who understands nothing of what we hear, who hears what
we do not understand” (Barthes 1975 [1973]: 25).
The longer I write, the more I long to become the bird Barthes writes
about—tilted head, paper­light bones—hearing what they don’t understand.
Gliding past meaning, past the idea of borders in language, in my thoughts.
Leaving behind definitions to reach immediacy. Obviously, in using language to communicate, there must be sense, structure, shared agreements. I
am well aware of this. But as a bird I am interested in the porosity of the inbetween­spaces. (Like the resting swallow fledglings in the arches below
Schloss Solitude—you can see their nests huddled against the white corners,
you can see the three of them sitting in there, but you cannot see how this
tiny structure can actually contain them.)
The ineffable inside us, this December white sky, produces the possibility of poetry—as there are no ways to be precise about what is inside, we
have to be poetic and imaginative; we have to create our own room of
meaning, a room which is different for every Other who enters it. This is the
room in which I lingered when I worked on Savyon’s poems. We met and
she read her texts to me—that unbelievably lenient and perpetual sound of
pebbles in a creek—and then explained every word to me in English: what it
means, why she chose it, what its roots are, what it sounds like, what she associates with it. What was apparent, even to a bird’s ear (which is usually to
be found right beneath the eye) is how Savyon’s poems are built on rhythm
and sound. I tried to find equivalent echoes in German, which in many cases
led to shifts in meaning. I, in return, read my versions to Savyon, who doesn’t speak German, and on her turn heard what hadn’t been said. I explained
the meaning of new words I had chosen because of their sound, and thus added new layers, new nests.
──
144
In German, I do not use the word Übersetzung (translation) to talk about
the project with Savyon. I prefer ungewisse Übertragungen (uncertain transferences), a term I coined to relate to the audience’s expectation of how a
“real” translation is done.
Imagine, for you, too, there must be a presupposition, a plumed delusion. While we worked on the transferences we still did not know what we
were actually saying—we heard the languages meet and resonate. The silence in which we met was voice without meaning. I learned about the relation between German and Hebrew on a level of sound. I learned about the
Niqqud, the little dots that are, when writing poetry, added to the Hebrew
signs to indicate the vowels—to ensure that it’s not the vowels which are
left to the reader’s imagination, but the world. I learned about roots.
Unversehens eine Welt
unversehens fallen die Seelen
und ich fang sie auf
ich rette sie und flute die Ufer
bei Bedarf
Suddenly a world
suddenly falling: the souls
and I catch them
I save them and flood the banks
as needed
Imagine for you, too, there must be a sentence, a journey. Going from
pure sound through an English intermediate state to my mother tongue, going from the somehow earthly, sedimentary Hebrew with eons inscribed
through quotidian, pragmatic English to my way of using German: lean,
airy, homely. How can an I which is female (something like I­she) be repro­

duced in German? How can a human­she be conveyed? Through my vision
(how to get rid of the eyes and bring in the ears) of what the poems in
Hebrew meant, I started to hear my own language, its possibilities and restrictions, differently. Going back and forth between the languages became
primarily a potentiality, a task not of finding the right word but the right
consistency: “We must use a language that remains breathful, alive, sensible. Thus we must attend to the quality of the words we choose, of the tone
of voice” (Irigaray 2002: 87).
It was a very gentle way of writing, balancing one sky in between two
worlds. When I write in English I am aware of my limitations, I know that I
do not have the same sensitivity at my command as in German. I can express my thoughts, but there’s always a certain amount of doubt, of unpleasant reduction. My language feels sifted: only the coarse and clumsy (klutzy,
says the dictionary and couldn’t be more right) bits make it to the page,
stacking up like Tetris blocks. Almost never does the long four brick bar arrive in time. But I am the same person in English as I am in German (unlike
in French, in which I am a five year old, more pointing and grimacing than
verbally expressing myself), it’s just the minutiae that get lost.
Translating my own texts into English means rewriting them with the
language switched in my head. Writing in English means writing with lesser
supplies. When I write in German, I feel like knowing (owning?) (owing?)
all the words, which lets me get every nuance right. On rare occasions, I feel
almost all­powerful. And there it is: the power. The power of belonging. A
belonging in which language can become a barbarous blade. Imagine for
you, too, there is a sentence, an ancestry. This is not the place to discuss fascism (the old, the new) in Germany, the way it was never addressed in my
family and all the families of my friends, the shivers of speechlessness running through three generations. This is just to say that the idea of encountering the Other with true openness had for me, in this context, an existential
quality—allowing for the words, the sounds to meet in the here and now,

We didn’t know where our project would lead us when we started to
work on it. It could have been a lost way or lost time. But once we sat down
and I started to listen, a quality of proximity unfolded that I had never experienced before. It wasn’t about us, it wasn’t about the words. It was about
the worlds. After I had translated the first batch of poems, we started to read
them simultaneously (at least the short ones), again sitting in the communal
dining area, our voices bouncing off tables, walls and the red­dot­embossed
PVC floor. Whoever was walking by to get a coffee or juice stopped.
Listened. Smiled. Most of those passersby knew neither Hebrew nor German. For them, it was even more sound, even less meaning. One night in
August, after having met four or five times, we invited all the fellows to an
informal reading in Schloss Solitude’s Guibal Saal: in pyjamas, on mats and
pillows. A warm and soft silence was what filled the room after we had finished. A., who also didn’t speak German, said: “That was touching.”
“Touching means to touch on something evanescent which—like a ghost
—eludes the touch“ (Steinweg 2010: 30, my translation).

In Nebensächlich, Nomade, language became the place of presence and
absence at the same time, through listening more than saying. The tangency
cannot be located at an exact, predicted, predetermined point somewhere
here, but in infinity, far beyond our reach or comprehension. In our project,
bringing poems from one language to another, translation “is an asymptote:
no matter how close we try to get, there’s always a space between the two
bodies and that is the space where we live” (Antena 2014: 1).
Today, I arrived late to the library. All the window seats (facing the Mason’s Yard, where John Lennon first met Yoko Ono in 1966) were taken,
which is why I’m sitting at a desk right next to the rare books glass cabinets.
On the shelf below Images of Bath there are two unequally proportioned
volumes in a slipcase: Ovid’s Metamorph. English’d by Caxton 1480. English’d! To ‘English’ a Latin text, to ‘German’ Hebrew poems: using language as a transitive verb to escape the translation as an unflinching removal of a word from one place, carrying it over to another place where it had
never been before and maybe never wanted to go. Using language as a
transitive verb to keep the word in its vested place (where it is used to the
weather, the consistency of bread, the greeting conventions) and think of it
while being somewhere else—in a house of broken dishes on the sea, in a
house of paper among high mountains, in a house of dust on open ground.16
When I wrote this bit, I must have blocked out the obvious reference—
Barthes’ elaboration on writing as an intransitive verb. Today I was reminded of it, reading in The Rustle of Language in the German edition: Das
Rauschen der Sprache (Barthes 2006 [1984]). Already slipping between languages, let me leave the transitivity aside and turn to the verbs: Rauschen is
what strong, green leaves do in the wind. It is not what small animals (a
mouse, a hedgehog, a blackbird) do while making their way through a pile
of dry autumn leaves. In German, unlike in French and English, for the
16 see Alison Knowles’ 1967 computer poem “House of Dust”, reimplemented by Nick
Montfort, https://nickm.com/memslam/a_house_of_dust.html (accessed 13 May 2019).

sound of bestirred dead leaves and loose leaves or paper in general, there is
another term: rascheln. Both words are onomatopoetic and I see why translator Dieter Horning chose to make le bruissement into Rauschen—a word
like a grandiose boulevard in early summer—the sound of superiority and
baffled audiences (rauschender Applaus as enthusiastic response), to which
Barthes is undoubtedly entitled. But wouldn’t he, being the cautious thinker
he was, have liked even more to be a fur­skinned, fast­heart­rate creature,
rustling ceaselessly through the pages of world’s literature and our conceptions of it? I, for one, would like him to have liked that earthy smell, the
porous light, the confident decay.
Savyon and I did another reading from our project during the Soft Power
Palace Festival in Stuttgart (30 October 2018), and still nobody who could
speak both German and Hebrew had read the texts. A part of me wishes that
it could have stayed that way, but when Akademie Schloss Solitude’s publishing house Edition Solitude offered us a book deal for the manuscript, we
felt that we needed to make sure there were no strange glitches. And there
were some, though not many—Savyon meant “hores”, where I had understood “horrors”, for example. Sometimes I think of the Hebrew­German
proofreading as weakness, as caving in, as a tribute to a more conventional
approach to language, where there is no space between the soft, bird­like
bodies of the words, where there are equations and two outcomes of a result:
equal or not equal17. Sometimes I am quite proud that, apart from two or
three mundane misunderstandings that I corrected, all the poems stayed the
way I wrote them at first. They are made from silence, from words and images, that were there and not there at the same time.
“Nothing is lost in translation. Everything was always already lost, long
before we arrived“ (Antena 2014: 1).

The Space in Between—Heterotopia and Writing
──
157
In fact, proximity to the other and closeness between us can be
reached when engendering a common world together, a world that
will not destroy the world which is proper to each one. Here nihilism
finds a positive fulfilment. Calling into question one’s own world, so
as to preserve the existence and the access to the world of the other,
allows and needs to bring about a nothing which will permit the articulation between two worlds. (Irigaray 2011: 112)
I used to be a humaness, to say words like a humaness, to grab hold like
a humaness. Now I am a little interval and it’s hard to tell what little refers
to: the absence of colour or the span of my arms.
I like to think of the space between two bodies or worlds, between the
writer and the reader, between the one and the other as a metaphorical instance of space that is there and at the same time is not, a concept which was
described by Michel Foucault in a talk about other spaces for architects:
There are also, probably in every culture, in every civilization,
real places—places that do exist and that are formed in the very
founding of society— which are something like counter­sites [...|.
Places of this kind are outside of all places, even though it may be
possible to indicate their location in reality. Because these places are
absolutely different from all the sites that they reflect and speak
about, I shall call them, by way of contrast to utopias, heterotopias.
(Foucault 1986 [1967]: 24)
Foucault himself only gave a very open description of the concept of
heterotopia, his “outlines of heterotopia attempt to explain principles and
features of a range of cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are
somehow ‘different’: disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory and
transforming” (Johnson 2013: 790). The widely­known examples he gave of
heterotopias are zoos, hospitals, cemeteries and other places that are outside
regular environments or society. But Foucault also said that in the play of
children, heterotopia plays a major role, as a locally constructed utopia:
These counter­spaces are well recognised by children. Certainly,
it’s the bottom of the garden; or even more, it’s the Indian tent erected in the middle of the attic; or still, it’s Thursday afternoons on
their parents’ bed. It is on that bed where they discover the ocean, as
──
158
they can swim between the covers, and the bed is also the sky, or
they can bounce on the springs; it’s the forest as they can hide there;
or still, it’s night as they can become ghosts between the sheets.
(Foucault as quoted in Johnson 2013: 798)
In these examples, the heterotopias are created in the imaginary, the
starting point is the same definite space—the parents’ bed—but the other,
the imagined space, is always different, is inhabited and brought to life by
play. The fact that the parents are not present when the bed is transformed
into the ocean, the sky or the forest might be of importance; the imagination
has to be shared and to be undoubtedly real in this moment for making the
other space come to life. The other space, shared but separate, intimate but
indirect.
The dichotomy of intimacy without fusion is formulated referring to language in Heidegger’s remarks on the related but separated relationship
between things and the world:
For world and things do not subsist alongside one another. They
penetrate each other. Thus the two traverse a middle. In it, they are at
one. Thus at one they are intimate. The middle of the two is intimacy. The intimacy of the world and thing is not a fusion. Intimacy
obtains only where the intimate—world and thing—divides itself
cleanly and remains separated. (Heidegger 1971 [1959]: 199)
That intimacy in the middle of the two is essential to me, and, in fact,
the German original sounds different: “Die Mitte der Zwei ist die Innigkeit”
(2003 [1959]: 24). Innigkeit has no physical connotation like intimacy, quite
the contrary. The adjective innig is usually used to describe a type of love:
jemanden innig lieben/to love someone dearly, it is almost a childlike love.
Innigkeit is not holding back; it is a complete openness without expectations. The middle of the two is where they are and remain separated, “the
ever open place, the unwaning light in which that one being, that thing, remains forever exposed and sealed off” (Agamben 1995 [1985]: 61).
──
159
Sometimes, what unfolds in the distance is the space in which the author
can create (themselves). Canetti, commenting on Kafka’s love letters to Felice Bauer, suggests that the relationship did have a major impact on his
artistic productivity because it was “security somewhere far off, a source of
strength sufficiently distant to leave his sensitivity lucid, not perturbed by
too close a contact” (Canetti 1974 [1969]: 14). “The important thing about
Felice was that she did exist, that she was not invented, and that, the way
she was, she could not have been invented by Kafka” (Canetti 1974 [1969]:
33). Again, distance and proximity are floating to create a counter­space, in
this particular case a space of proliferating narratives.
Felice, as Canetti points out, couldn’t have been invented. She had to be
there, existing with a body and a life, where Kafka could desire her in narrative, imagining an intimacy with her based on the information he made her
give him: “He asks her to tell him when she arrives at her office, what she
has had for breakfast, what sort of view she has from her office window,
what sort of work she is doing” (Canetti 1974 [1969]: 12). He could leave
her sealed off in reality, but be one with her in writing:
Across the distance between Prague and Berlin he wishes to hold
fast to her robustness. The weak words that he is permitted to address to her come back from her ten times stronger. [...] The struggle
to obtain this strength which her regular letters bring him does have
a meaning. It is no empty exchange of letters, no end in itself, no
mere self­gratification: it helps his writing. (Canetti 1974 [1969]: 13)
It serves his writing insofar as his thoughts, his words are now directed
to and answered by an Other. An Other who, sitting at a desk, lying on a bed
from a safe distance, imagines with him the ocean, the forest, the sky, the
ghosts. An Other who invites him to carve out his own territory, to “establish [… himself] as particular, outdo [… himself] in a sublime Other—metaphor or metonymy of the sovereign Good” (Kristeva 1987 [1983]: 7).

How to Disappear—Foucault and Oulipo
But where am I as a writer if writing is a practice of here and not here? How
is it possible to touch and at the same time elude touch? There’s one image
in Foucault’s famous 1969 essay What is an Author? which makes my skin
tingle, because it’s a piece of legerdemain. With the quickest of hands Foucault turns the writer into a ghost—“here and at the same time elsewhere,
fleeting yet present” (Steinweg 2010: 30, my translation)—or even more
than that: flatly makes her disappear. Evidently, not in a deep burgundy sequin dress, but in some sort of clean, potentially matte grey hollow:
Writing unfolds like a game (jeu) that invariably goes beyond its
own rules and transgresses its limits. In writing, the point is not to
manifest or exalt the act of writing, nor is it to pin a subject within
language; it is, rather, a question of creating a space into which the
writing subject constantly disappears. (Foucault 1984 [1969]: 102)
Disappearing from the surface of what is surrounding me. Disappearing
and disintegrating at the same time. Where does it start? In the space
between the fingertips and the keys? And when? Even a continuous development needs to begin at some point, doesn’t it? Was my disappearance initiated when I decided to be a writer? How was the disappearance able to tell
that I took this lingering decision? Let me think of Foucault’s original from
here, where I sit—in a house made of books under an unabridged sky:
L’écriture se déploie comme un jeu qui va infailliblement au­delà
de ses règles, et passe ainsi au­dehors. Dans l’écriture, il n’y va pas
de la manifestation ou de l’exaltation du geste d’écrire; il ne s’agit
pas de l’épinglage d’un sujet dans un langage; il est question de
l’ouverture d’un espace où le sujet écrivant ne cesse de disparaître.
(Foucault 1969, online)

In the original, the room is not created, it’s opened. A set of keys
fumbled for, a heavy door is moved, a triangle of light is poured out onto the
floor. Or a motion detector is waved at, to convince it of the subject’s substance, to make sheets of glass slide away, soundless. But the room itself is
already always there, defined, stable. Of what is this room constructed?
Stacked reverse sides of printed manuscript drafts? Neatly composed rubbers? Is it a cave, a gap, a crack?
“What pleasure wants is the site of a loss, the seam, the cut, the deflation, the dissolve which seizes the subject in the midst of bliss” (Barthes
1975 [1973]: 7).
Dissolving or disintegrating in the midst of bliss, that is, between one
word and the other. Maybe the room has been there for a very long time,
maybe it was only recently built: brackish stone, powdery carpet, dazzling
white. A room waiting to be entered to subsequently alter the writer’s containedness: from there to not there. This is the room’s power or purpose, no
matter whether someone is in it or not, no matter whether the door is
opened, ajar or closed. But more important than the room, “un espace”,
marked as indefinite, seems “l’ouverture”, definite action and definite article. The movement of writing leads to moving the door, which leads to vanishing. It is a consequential course of events, advanced by the use of written
words. Let me rephrase Foucault: writing is about getting access to the state
in which the text exceeds the writing subject, to avoid that, ultimately, the
writing subject beleaguers their own text and keeps it from transforming to
be the reader’s text, the reader’s imagination. Especially when writing about
one’s own experiences, the ability to unlock the door is crucial. Getting out
of the text to leave what it tells (to a certain extent) behind, getting closure
through the act of writing. But also getting out in order to make room for the
reader. When I work with students on their writing projects, this is the hard­
──
162
est bit to learn: anticipating the reader in the text, meeting their needs or not,
but in any case being aware of them.
I imagine the moment of opening the space’s door, quite dry and two dimensional. Like in this dream I’ve been having for years now: I am in my
apartment (which looks completely different from every apartment I have
ever lived in) and casually (that is, not by accident and not intentionally)
I’m opening a door (the door, the thus­far unnoticed door even though it
must have been there all the time, like all the other doors) which leads to a
room or a series of rooms (four adjacent neo­baroque style bathrooms, in the
latest iteration). My dream apartment is usually very small and lacks basic
features like walls or windows. Bats fly in and furniture flows out. The
rooms revealed by the door are a long­needed shelter, they provide some
sort of soft peace. My whole life and its circumstances make sense now
(even the bathrooms), I am finally ok. The whisper of uncertainty falls silent. And I fall asleep (in the bathtub­turned­bed) and I wake up in a brittle
sadness, because the room I have only just inspirited is gone already.
Is the room gone or am I gone? Or are we both nestled into one another?
Lydia Davis writes about the oscillation between dream state and dreamlike
experiences in everyday life in her prose miniature piece Swimming in
Egypt: Dreams While Awake and Asleep:
Part of my interest in not identifying which were actual dreams
was to allow the pieces to remain in the same dreamlike territory,
that zone in which our life experiences are sometimes stranger than
our sleeping experiences—though of course one striking aspect of
our role as protagonist in our dreams is, it seems to me, that we are
not surprised by the surprising things that occur, even though, usually, we believe what we are experiencing is real. (Davis 2007: 38)
Past the kitchen is a large bathroom with a trapezoidal bathtub.
Then a hallway and, at the very end, a somewhat worm­eaten door.
This is how I discover, for the first time in my life, that my apartment has two doors; I vaguely suspected as much, but I (finally?)
have tangible proof. I open the door. Immediately the three cats who
──
163
live in the apartment run out. There is one white cat and two grey
cats, one of which is certainly my cat. (Perec 2012 [1973]: 23)
Georges Perec, who shortly after having decided to record his dreams
realised that he was “having dreams only in order to write them” (Perec
2012 [1973]: 1), won’t get his dreamed cats back, they’ve freed themselves.
Do we have to expect something running from Foucault’s room? It is very
much still in there, the only movement seems to be caused by the writing
subject. A draft. A sound maybe? For me, Foucault’s room revealed through
writing, in all its nightliness, in its abruptness, coincides with the one Kafka
describes in each and every one of us (see Kafka 1991 [1953]: 1). The room
which is given away by the mirror’s clanking:
The mirror is, after all, a utopia, since it is a placeless place. In
the mirror, I see myself where I am not, in an unreal, virtual space
that opens up behind the surface; I am over there, there where I am
not, a sort of shadow that gives my own visibility to myself, that enables me to see myself there where I am absent: such is the utopia in
the mirror. But it is also a heterotopia in so far as the mirror does exist in reality, where it exerts a sort of counteraction on the position
that I occupy. (Foucault 1986 [1967]: 24)
Let me go back again to Foucault’s words: a room in which the writing
subject never ceases to disappear. Right? It’s not the room that is reason to
disappear, it’s the room extending the already­established disappearance into
a far future.
Was there ever a moment of just being?
Why is never ceasing to disappear another asymptotic figure?
Does opening the door amount to immortality?
In the beginning there were clouds, there were bones, there were cliffs.
Maybe even the sky was white. Maybe even at night. In the beginning, there
was no need for underlining, for correcting, for crossing anything out.

Wherever it is located, this room unfolding between the writer’s body
and the emptiness, between author and reader, between language and silence, whatever it is made from, it represents the transitional process of
ideas from the writer to the reader, the steady flow of images, the uncertainty of where the words end up, how they are taken or understood.
The room in which or from which one writes as a contained absence:
Maggie Nelson, in The Argonauts, quotes Carson’s advice to always write in
a manner which leaves the space in the middle empty for god. Text like potted bonsai trees—planted right off the centre to make room for the divine
(cf. Nelson 2015: 49). In thinking about writing, I prefer to substitute god
with the power of creation. And the power of creation with the reader of a
text. Writing in order to leave a little space: to articulate the ineffable, the
unspeakable, the speechlessness.
Monsieur Foucault, assuming that I could address you somehow, would
you allow me to ask you this question: do you have days when you feel
more translucent than others? Do you also fear, when the sliding doors
between train cars refuse to move despite the fact that you are clearly standing in front of them, that it has happened at last, that you have become invisible? Does this realisation reassure you? Monsieur Foucault, assuming that
disappearing is a desirable quality, does everybody have a share in it, or is it
a privilege of writers? Of whoever creates something that exists outside him
or herself, possibly also outside his or her time? Monsieur Foucault, assuming that you don’t already know, I need to tell you that I have deliberately
stashed away the lines right above the paragraph with the room. The ones in
which you say:
First of all, we can say that today’s writing has freed itself from
the dimension of expression. Referring only to itself, but without being restricted to the confines of its interiority, writing is identified
with its own unfolded exteriority. This means that it is an interplay
of signs arranged less according to its signified content than accord­
──
165
ing to the very nature of the signifier. Writing unfolds like a game
(jeu) that invariably goes beyond its own rules and transgresses its
limits. (Foucault 1984 [1969]: 102)
Monsieur Foucault, assuming that you were microscopically aware of
your time’s literature, I am quite sure that in the image of writing “that has
freed itself from the dimension of expression” you are alluding to the
Oulipian authors, first and foremost Georges Perec, who just had published
or was just about to publish his lipogrammatic novel La Disparition. But
also his comrade­in­arms (in hands), Raymond Queneau, who had founded
Oulipo 1960 together with François Le Lionnais. Monsieur Foucault, assuming that you’d like to know what the Oulipiens are up to nowadays, I
picked the constraint “à supposer”, a rather simple one saying that every
sentence has to start with “assuming that”, to write these paragraphs. It’s
from Jaques Jouet from 1993, to be found on the archive of constraints on
Oulipo’s website.18
To escape the arbitrariness of writing as, essentially, anything can be
written (in writing there usually is no limitation of the outcome due to any
kind of availability of resources), Oulipo relied on rules, sometimes very
simple ones (like the one I used) sometimes tremendously complicated sets
of rules. Like the Cahier de charge (1993), which took Perec more than two
years to create and compile, that determined quotes, places and characters
that had to appear in each chapter of Life: A user’s manual (2009) [1987].
I work quite often with constraints—using very simple ones—and I
know both mechanisms well: the bewilderment after the constraint is established (for example, re­narrate Goethe’s Sorrows of the Young Werther using
only the vowel e, in the 2014 Butterland project Werthers versehrtes Herz),
the absolute certainty that it is never going to work. But, of course, it is and
after a while I become a service provider for my text rather than its author.
My only task is to find words without any other vowel than e, apart from
18 https://www.oulipo.net/fr/contraintes/a­supposer (accessed 1 December 2019).
──
166
this assistance, the text itself decides its direction and progress. I start to
fade.
When the Oulipian authors call themselves “rats who must build the
labyrinth from which they propose to escape” (Motte 1986: 22), Foucault’s
image of the disappearance room coincides with constrained writing techniques: they contribute to constructing the space which opens itself up to
dissolution. This is especially true for the works of writers at the beginning
of their careers: constraints provide helpful guidance and insights. They
drastically reduce the amount of decisions that have to be taken, they help in
creating distance and take away the pressure from the writing subject: for
the time being not the individual experience or way to see and think about
the world is important, but only the language itself. Constraints inevitably
create a complicity between the writer and the reader. As if the readers are
the co­players of a text through interpreting and appropriating it, the writers
are also co­players of the text through following its rules (or breaking them).

Digression: The Heterotopian Writing Workshop
Over the last couple of years spent teaching the basic level prose module
at the Swiss Literature Institute, the beginner’s writing workshop for the art
students at Berne University of the Arts, and a continuous creative writing
workshop at the Adult Education Centre in Biel, I compiled, invented and
tested many writing impulses, partly based on the Oulipo methods. I use the
word impulse deliberately, because exercise (as much as I love it as a literary form) implies conforming as opposed to creating. To open, even for beginners and non­professional writers, the space to disappear, I found impulses helpful that work, on some level, with absence. I’ve developed a (naturally) loose teaching approach that I’d like to think of as The Heterotopian
Writing Workshop. It is, on the one hand, a way of thinking about teaching
writing and, on the other hand, a collection of references and impulses that
can be adapted for each group or context. In the following, I will present a
selection of impulses (those which work best and are the most fun) which
can be used in the given order or independently of each other.
Hiding Words
My signature writing workshop impulse, which I usually propose right
at the beginning, is called Hiding Words and I developed it to help the participants to learn to write with the reader in mind. Everybody draws a word
(nouns, I usually take them from a text that I will discuss later on in the
workshop) and has five minutes to write a short text in which the word appears, but in a way that the others, when listening to the text, won’t notice
which word it was. It is not permitted to use it in a compound or alter it in
any other way. After the writing period, the participants read their texts one
by one. After each text is read, those who listened get to say, in a quick
──
168
round, what they suspect to be the hidden word. Everybody who guessed
right gets one point. If nobody guessed right, the author gets two points.
Usually, the price for the winner is coffee, but it is not really about winning
or losing. It is about guiding the readers, while the intention is to mislead
them. It’s a game of inversion, a game of there and not there, a game as a
key to perform the opening of the room inside.
Un-understanding
This group of impulses might have anticipated the uncertain transferences from Hebrew to German: in fact, I started using it after I had translated a horoscope from an Icelandic supermarket magazine into German (it
goes without saying, without knowing Icelandic). Un­understanding is a set
of three translation experiments that starts with a poem by Magnus WilliamOlsson in Swedish. I ask the participants to bring it into German (in the rare
case that someone does actually speak Swedish, I have a spare Polish
poem). This impulse is based on the book Homullus absconditus [Hypno­Homullus] by German poet Monika Rinck (2016), who has “translated”
the whole book under the same conditions. The reading of the resulting
poems or texts (which usually work with sound similarities to go from one
language into another) is highly liberating as it takes away the layers of
sense and nonsense and leaves just language itself. The follow­up task is to
identify one line or image that the author likes a lot and use it as a starting
point for a whole new text.
The second experiment takes the attention away from the sound, and directs it at the visual appearance of a script. I distribute copies of asemic writings (e.g. Dermisache 2018), that is, drawings that look like text but do not
have any specific semantic content (cf. Fenstermaker 2018). I again ask the
participants to “translate” these drawings into German. It is rare that somebody just writes their own text (independently of the drawing) and then declares it a “translation”, usually the participants work with graphic resemblances: the length and the number of words and lines are kept, the style of
──
169
the drawing implies the tone of the text (thick lines are translated into an
angry voice, for example), signs which look like punctuation marks (e.g.
fraction bars) are used in the respective logic. The strength of this impulse is
that can be used as a very strict set of constraints, but it can also be seen as
an inspiration or pretext to write whatever the participants want to write.
The follow up task is to produce an asemic writing piece and exchange it
with someone else as an optional writing impulse for at home.
The third experiment is much more serious (basically, after those first
two experiments, whatever is proposed in the course of the workshop seems
quite feasible and easy, so even insecure participants will feel confident to
share their work). It is based on the book Deutsch­deutsche Übersetzerwerkstatt (Allemann/Engeler 2010) in which sets of two poets have exchanged a series of poems and “translated” those they’ve received into their
own style. I distribute examples of these translations without any contextual
information, and ask the participants to figure out what is going on in the
texts. It is fascinating to see how complicated their explanations can be,
once they are really aware of the poems’ details. After having revealed the
procedure, the participants are invited to pick a poem and “translate” it into
their own style.
When I teach writing for non­writers, I often work with absent context
information to allow for a different kind of approach to text—attentive,
alert. I also let them read some twenty pages of Raymond Queneau’s Exercises in Style (1958) with the titles removed, or discuss only the first page of
a short story in depth before reading it as a whole.
Invisible Beginnings
Another strategy is to use titles or first sentences as impulses. There are
quite a lot that work very well, but two have proven to be especially productive:
──
170
Things That Disappear—the title of a book by the German author Jenny
Erpenbeck (Dinge, die verschwinden, Erpenbeck 2009)19, which contains
short stories about places, objects or people who disappear: the Palace of the
Republic, bulky waste, socks, cheese and so on.
This is the story I wouldn’t tell you when I was your girlfriend—the first
sentence of Miranda July’s brilliant short story The Swim Team (July 2007:
13).
Die Bibliothek der ungeschriebenen Bücher – a book by Annette Pehnt
(2014) that compiles ideas for books by contemporary German authors
which were never realised. I distribute the fictive covers (which were made
especially for the compilation) of these non­existent books copied on cards,
all featuring the author’s name and their title for the project.
I don’t give much time to react to those impulses, only 5 to 8 minutes.
The tight time frame helps to avoid self­censorship and unproductive
doubts. After this, the authors read their pieces. I moderate the feedback discussions to focus on how or where the text could go on, so that what was
written becomes the seed for a new text. Usually, the given sentence or title
can be left out in the end, as it was just a vehicle to reach the actual story
that wanted to be told.
It’s the quality of dematerialisation, of time passing, of parallelity that
make these impulses very easy to react to: all kinds of presence (in a physical and temporal sense) are implied and ready to be substantiated in the realm
of writing.
Not Knowing
A constraint that is very productive during editing texts is “I don’t
know…”, which I was introduced to in Madelyn Kent’s workshop Sense
Writing20 in December 2017 in Brooklyn, NY. Her concept interweaves writ19 in excerpts translated by Susan Bernofsky on
http://intranslation.brooklynrail.org/german/from­things­that­disappear

ing and the Feldenkrais method (which works with constrained micro­movements), but I’ve used the constraint in my workshops without the movement
aspect and it works just fine. I ask the participants to identify a passage in
their text which feels flat, that lacks something, but it is not clear to them
what is missing. The first task is to really immerse themselves in the scene.
Then they have 10 minutes to write about it, but every sentence has to start
with “I don’t know…”. It is possible to add another 10 minutes of free writing and also to talk about the difference between writing with the constraint
and without it—I usually ask everybody to choose the text that was easier to
write and read one sentence aloud from it. Two or three participants have
found the free writing easier than the constrained. The rest are usually quite
happy with what appears through the not­knowing technique—they end up
with ten or fifteen topics that they can address in new texts. It is astonishing
how even writers who have never developed a character before come up
with just the right questions using this constraint. It makes the writing subject disappear, in the sense that it emphasises intuition rather than constructions or concepts, it automatically turns the “desire­to­write” (Barthes 2011
[2003]: 128) into writing. Obviously, what has been found with the constraint’s help has to be developed further in writing, it is only the first step to
unflattening a passage. But apart from the actual result, the inversion is significant: by addressing the lack, embracing what is not there, the gaps start
to be filled.
Here
The idea of the other space, of a space which becomes an other through
attribution or imagination, is at the very core of the concept of Heterotopia.
To incorporate this idea in a comprehensive, intuitive way into my writing
workshops, I work with different methods and tools.
One is based on Richard McGuire’s graphic novel Here (2014), in which
he tells the story of one specific place from 500,957,406,073 BCE to the
year 2033 CE. In the given time, it turns from lava into woods into a clear­
──
172
ing, where a shack is built, and later turned into a house and into an apartment. Every double page shows the exact same view, what changes (in the
years of the apartment) are the inhabitants and the minutiae of their lives.
Using a photocopy of one moment in the apartment as a starting point, the
task is to imagine different moments in time (a week after or before, a
month after or before, a year after or before) in the same apartment. A follow­up task is to write about the life in one’s own apartment before one
lived there.
Another space­based impulse needs visual representations of different
kinds of rooms (I use, for example, Polly Shindler’s illustrations of living
rooms and kitchens21) which don’t feature any people or animals. The first
task is to write freely about the room. The second task is to imagine two
characters who are talking to each other through the room—if there’s a living room shown, the characters can be imagined in adjacent rooms like the
kitchen or bathroom. The third task is to pick one of the characters and write
about a small monstrousness in their everyday life that had occurred a
couple of days earlier and wasn’t noticed by anyone else other than the character. Building up the tasks in this way, instead of just demanding the last
one, leads to an automatic grounding in the character’s development, the
character that was created by their room, so to speak.
A very different approach to using space as a means to inspire writing is
very Oulipian—I ask the participants to roll two 10­sided dice (with the numerals 0­9) and note the result as a two­digit number (higher numeral first).
This is the exact amount of words their text has to have. I usually take Lydia
Davis’ Odd Behaviour (2009: 182) as a title for the text, so it is not the
space itself that is the starting point for the text, but what shapes the text significantly. The constraint usually inspires quite pointed texts, as the ending
becomes an essential part of the beginning. The parents’ bed turns into a
ship, into a mountain, into a colony of bats as the writers go back and forth
21 https://pollyshindlerpainting.com/painting­2017/ (accessed 17 December 2019).
──
173
between where their text is right now and where they want it to end, echolocating their stories in the territory of potential.
Alternatively, and less mathematically, this embrace of the ending can be
achieved by working with last sentences (which have to come last in the
newly written texts, too) instead of titles or first sentences as writing impulses. My favourite last sentences are from Daniil Kharms, who is a master
in going back from the ending to the beginning, where he, mischievously,
makes the story disappear altogether (all from Kharms 2007):
“After that, everyone went home” (p. 48).
“And that’s it, more or less” (p. 56).
“This is how a fine summer’s day began” (p. 84).
There was a redheaded man who had no eyes or ears. He didn’t have hair either, so he was called a redhead arbitrarily. He couldn’t talk because he had no mouth. He didn’t have a nose either. He
didn’t even have arms or legs. He had no stomach, he had no back,
no spine, and he didn’t have any insides at all. There was nothing!
So, we don’t even know who we’re talking about. We’d better not
talk about him any more. (p. 45)
──
174
Now that Kharms is gone, and the students, and their desire to write, and
probably also the bats, I am the only one left to write this chapter to its ending. There is not much to add, apart from some words about what I meant by
stating that the Heterotopian Writing Workshop is also a way of thinking
about teaching writing. More precisely, it is a way of thinking of my own
position or presence, this is to say: it is the desire to be there (to support)
and not there (as a necessity in the texts)—to find impulses that open the
participants’ own rooms, which are and have to remain unknowable to me.
To make this point very clear, I keep two baseball caps in my classroom,
props I borrowed from John Zorn: when conducting his madcap (!) ensemble Cobra, each musician has a white terry­cloth headband dangling
from their music stand. Whenever they feel they know where the piece
should go better than John Zorn, they put it on (great hair results) and Zorn
has to take off the cap he’s wearing. This is how they become the conductor
(as long as they want to or John Zorn lets them—when he puts his hat back
on, the headband authority comes to its end. Sometimes, he also calls on
someone to put on their headband so that he can just listen). As I don’t wear
a cap, I modified this detail of the rule: if a student puts on one of the caps, I
have to put on the other, and they conduct the writing room while I, as a
teacher, am spirited away.

The Everything and the Sky—On Writing Fragments
──
176
Walk past a mirror and remind yourself of an old friend.
I cannot remember when I began to write in fragments. Or if I’ve ever
been writing without the bliss of cuts, of the white space encasing the words
on their page. A soft and kindhearted place made of an embrace, of membranes, of lime stone.
Typically fragments are less works than gestures, arrows pointing in the direction a person might research, meditate on or develop.
Unlike paragraphs or sentences, they do not flow directly from and
into their bordering text. Instead they are independent, defined by
their singularity, by the white space that encases them on a page—
even when they are cobbled together and marshalled into service as
the contents of a book. (Segal 2011: 158)
Pointing in a direction rather than actually going there is what makes
fragments so exciting and precious for me as a reader and a writer. The
white space is encasing—holding, carrying, substantiating—because it is
not an absence, but a presence. Let’s inverse the contemporary logic of writing as a technique of addition and employ, just to the end of this paragraph,
a clay tablet logic: the white space around a fragment contains—like white
light containing all the other wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum—
everything that was, is and could be told. Writing a fragment means carefully removing layer after layer of the everything until there is only the
something left in these particular spots—so delicate and thin that what creates the contrast on the page is the universe’s ceaselessness shining through.

“Each something is the celebration of the nothing that supports it”
(Cage 1973: 139).

Imagine a thread tying you to all the people you love dearly. Think of
the thread’s colour as often as you can.
Writing fragments is a heterotopic practice, since what is left out becomes as (or even more) important as what materialises on the page. A great
example of these kinds of texts are Yoko Ono’s pieces, published in
Grapefruit (1970) and Acorn (2013). They are less encased by the page’s
white and the totality of written words than they are by the world itself and
the totality of its spaces, its encounters, its wondrousness. Only a few weeks
after I had found and bought Acorns by chance (it was the white silkscreen
print of an acorn on the sky blue cover that caught my attention—the attention of a wintered squirrel rustling through a Boston book store shelf) I started to write exercises in different collections: Übungen auf einem Schiff (Exercises on a boat, January 2018, as part of the participative writing performance Little Literary Studio in the Red House Gallery, East Village, NYC),
Exercises for an Urban Cowboy (March 2018, artist’s book exhibited at the
off space gallery Lokal.Int in Biel, Switzerland), Übungen am Spielfeldrand
(Exercises on the Edge of a Field, December 2018, live performance with
Christian Müller, commissioned by PAKT Bern) and Solitude Exercises
(March 2019).
For the latter collection, I invited other ex­fellows of Akademie Schloss
Solitude to contribute. The exercises scattered through this chapter (on the
page tops in italics) are a selection of the exercises I wrote for the Solitude
project, examining the notion of absence and presence as prerequisite of
artistic production. “Solitude Exercise” was published on Akademie Schloss
Solitude’s blog Schlosspost22 in February 2019 and in spring 2019 as an
artist’s book.

Let a stranger write a word they haven’t used in a long time on the back
of your hand. See if it bleeds through.
Words that definitely bled through my hands came from Maggie Nelson
—most of all Bluets (2009), her book in fragments, and Jane (2005), which
I will discuss in the next chapter, but also The Argonauts (2015), which unfolds its blasting strength through insisting and repeating.
It goes without saying that Wittgenstein is an important reference concerning fragmented, almost mathematical ways of composing a whole from
smaller pieces (Nelson confirms this, adding, of course, Roland Barthes’
practice of writing in fragments, cf. Segal 2011), which Katherine Angel adapted in a literary text—in Unmastered (2012), she works extensively with
the white space and numbers structuring the sentences of her novel. But the
book that motivated me most to not only write about Heterotopia in this
thesis, but to write in a heterotopic, that is, fragmented way, was This Little
Art by Kate Briggs (2017). Talking about the conditions and possibilities of
translation, the text embodies different voices and uses the ever­new gesture
of commencing writing to underline the brittle practice of bringing text from
one language’s context to another:
Translation as the chance—a translation project as a means of
giving oneself the chance—of being taught by the other’s writing,
where answers to questions of how to be responsible for this writing,
and whether or not you or I will be capable of taking responsibility
for this writing are, again, in no way given in advance. (Briggs 2017:
207)

Synchronise your breath with the free­line telephone signal. Hang up
before someone picks up the phone. Keep the rhythm as long as you can.
Not knowing whose voice I am going to read next, in fact, not knowing
where I am going to end up at all captures the bliss of turning the page of a
picture book as a child, all on edge to see what would happen next (even
with those books we knew by heart—would Goldilocks get out of the family
bear’s house this time, too?). As the paradigm of consequence is rippled, the
world is suddenly multiplied. Yes, there needs to be some sort of coherence
to be leaping as a reader and not falling, but it’s a subtle structure, not necessarily known to the reader (Maggie Nelson established seven themed categories for the fragments’ composition in Bluets, but the text itself doesn’t
reveal this blueprint, it’s only function was to help the author decide which
fragments had to be included in the book and which hadn’t (cf. Segal
2011)).

Consider that you are a being living in outer space as often as you can.
Has it never happened, as you were reading a book, that you kept
stopping as you read, not because you weren’t interested, but because you were: because of a flow of ideas, stimuli associations? In a
word, haven’t you ever happened to read while looking up from your
book? (Barthes 1989 [1984]: 29)
Right now, the universe is the colour of recycled paper in the 90s, at
least when seen through the library’s not­very­recently­cleaned skylights. If
I look up from the screen and down from the sky, the two shades of white
become one: the page as an imprint of the afternoon clouds, always already
carrying the words away into the vastness. Yes, I do look up often: from
books, from this manuscript, from conversations. To be honest, I think I
look up more than I look down (a hazardous habit especially in public transportation; going up the East Side in the 15 bus, I was once almost attacked
by a middle aged woman wearing a crop top which exposed a massive scar
running across her belly, a sentence coloured mountain range and I simply
couldn’t bring myself to looking down again, not before she started to shout
at me) this is “how I have my best ideas, how I best invent what is necessary
to my work” confesses Barthes (1976 [1973]: 24) and I nod: this is my basic
methodology for the text at hand, too. The indirectness is essential—letting
the texts and positions pass through my hand, through my body, through my
desire (cf. Barthes 1967: 5) and allow for a resonance in my own language,
in my own voice.
If the text “produces, in me, the best pleasure if it manages to make itself heard indirectly; if, reading it, I am led to look up often, to listen to
something else” (Barthes 1975 [1973]: 24), then working with fragments is
an invitation to the reader to scatter their thoughts, to listen to something or
someone else, to themselves, to the season. The author’s primacy is softened
(now there’s more blue in the sky, several bruise­shaped shards).

Imagine your body has leaves. Whisper all the colours you want them to
turn into, to an old love falling asleep.
As much as the incomplete is a matter of warmth and love, it is a matter
of fragility and inadequacy. “To be with the one I love and to think of something else: this is how I have my best ideas”, this is how Barthes introduces
the idea of looking up from the page to complete the reading and the writing
(Barthes 1975 [1973]: 24). To be with the one I love and silently returning
to my own world, to my own entanglements with the world, to my pleasantly illuminated studio inside. Or: to be with the one I love to allow myself
to enter the tingling inbetween space, that room that just wouldn’t exist
without this other presence, those additional hands helping to balance one
sky in between our two worlds, the sky which is my paper.
Mine. Not theirs.

Note down some evidence of why you are not somebody else’s imagination. Note down some suggestions for improvement just in case you are
somebody else’s imagination after all.
Who is this one I love who isn’t offended since 1973, when I left off in
the middle of a conversation over breakfast (pain au chocolat, orange juice,
a window in the apartment downstairs being repeatedly slammed shut by the
wind) to have my very best ideas? Where does all this generosity, sympathy
and support for my “anxious desire” (Barthes 2011 [2003]: 140) come from?
Maybe the one I love is, like Felice Bauer, an other in some distance that I
can address my writing to, ever so yearning? Then I wouldn’t be the one
who abandons or turns away internally, I’d just be absent minded from
thinking of the other. But the one I love is being with me (Etre avec), being
the capitalised first word in the sentence, and thus the one I love is imperatively tied to me in spacial immediacy. The one I love has to be sitting there,
in these dark blue faux silk pyjamas we found at a thrift store when we weren’t looking for anything to buy. Siting there, eating, crumbling, swallowing
and breathing in order for my thoughts to leave. What unfolds between me
and the one I love is the distance that bridges the sea miles between the parents’ bed and the ship which I am inventing to carry us away, us or me or
even you. It is the distance which is at the core of all that is told & written;
narrative, after all, is “a structure of desire, a structure that both invents and
distances its object and thereby inscribes again and again the gap between
signifier and signified” (Stewart 1984: ix).
──
184
Hide in a place that holds you comfortably (in the closet, under the
desk). Stay there, motionless, until your absence finds you.
What are the ideas the one I love cannot have because I am there but not
there? Or does it work both ways: the two of us are in the same room and
both following our thoughts at the same time? Is the sentence To be with the
one I love … also a meaningful proposition for the one I love? Contemporaneously? Or are we taking turns? Maybe the one I love doesn’t feel played
on, after all. Maybe the one I love is prepared for this game of inventing and
distancing—at least if Lyotard is right: the one I love knows how to love
and thus knows how to hide. How, otherwise, could there be love, could
there be language given all the distance, the lesions, the sea.
My mom always said ‘don’t cut if you’re afraid of scars’ says the one I
love, and we laugh, because isn’t the one I love simply hilarious, so patient
and unreasonably simple, and we choke a little on our pains au chocolat and
when we can finally breathe again, I have an excellent idea.

Collect all the materials in your apartment that would make a great cocoon. Rearrange them regularly.
Fragments lay open the longing which is immanent to all writing by acknowledging and inscribing this distance, the silence and gaps. The white
space enclosing them is a place for what is lost, for what wasn’t said, what
can’t be said, what never will be said. The white space belongs to those who
read. It is a room to embrace difference, a room that reminds us of all the
stories of all the people and all their dreams.

Choose the native animal you like the most. Provide a thoughtful house
for it in the room you spend the least time in. Leave a window ajar in twilight.
Voids are all around us. In a world that seeks to fill everything in
at all times, where everything must be busy and complete and overflowing, we should instead defend the integrity of the void. Some
voids are indeed bigger than others, but every little void is a reminder that the universe is incomplete and that this strange fact is, from
all angles a joyful thing. […] By suspending ourselves over the void
without falling in we come to understand that far from being something to fear, we should recognise and welcome the comfort that absence sometimes affords. (Power 2019: 18)

With a soft permanent marker circle a close friend’s bruises and scars,
the tiny ones too. When the ink is washed away, circle the same spots on
your own body. Document the fading for your friend.
The white space as the sky, a bandage, a void—the fragment as a literary
form encompasses the disparate dimensions of writing the way I see it. It
embraces a world full of incompleteness and over­flowing, but also of silence and being silenced. Writing fragments is taking a political stance insofar as it further dismantles the idea of master narratives by deliberately
stumbling and stuttering through cutting and pausing, the form prevents me
as the writing subject from being drawn into a flow of words that would
make me forget the uncertainty, injustice and inequality around me. In short,
the world. The encasing space is, whether it is conceptualised as a presence
of potential or an absence of power, “a Suspension, a final Suspense—I myself don’t know how it is going to turn out” (Barthes 2011 [2003]: 128).

Close the blinds and draw the curtains. Imagine the light twelve hours
and twelve days from now, in all the places you were exceptionally happy in.
The fragment is not only a way to write, an aesthetic or political choice,
but an essential condition for this project. It is fragmented knowledge that
can guide me on my journey to Alice. Many of her letters weren’t donated to
the archive by her mother and brother, or Alice herself didn’t keep them in
the first place. Alice’s resolutely determined quest was also dependent on
fragments, on a heterotopian coincidence even: the only reason for the clay
tablets, on which Linear B was found, outlasting the culture in which they
were written, is the final destruction of this very culture. The fire, which
broke out or was set in the Palace of Knossos on Crete, burnt it down and
burnt the clay slips with the palace’s inventory. Habitually, the clay had been
reused each year and therefore was left raw, the collapse and the fire is what
allowed them to endure in the soil.
It cannot be known if all the Linear B writing was some sort of accounting and thus referred to the present, or if writing was also used to document
the past, to pass on narration even. Alice argues that the long, narrow tablets
were shaped after palm tree leaves—either to cover stacks of this ephemeral
organic material or to resemble them. It is likely that the Cretans used palm
tree leaves or other perishable material for the bulk of their records, maybe
even for poetry or writing other than lists (cf. Kober 1948: 92). This writing,
if it once existed, is lost forever. The clay tablets are the only and final records of an obliterated civilisation. While the social structures that brought
them into existence disappeared, they lay safely in their wooden and lead
storage boxes in the ruins, like a caught breath in persistent decay.

The second grave moment of here­and­not­here in the process of the decipherment of Linear B was the accessibility of the inscriptions. After their
discovery, Sir Arthur Evans only published around 200 of the 2,500 inscriptions (cf. Kober 1944: 73). The rest he kept for himself. Officially to prepare
the publication, in truth, probably, to decipher Linear B himself. While he
cracked the system of numbers, he wasn’t successful with the other signs.
After his death, John Myres inherited the publication project from him and
tried to find a classification system, but was quite lost: “The truth is that he
can’t read the Minoan scripts. May be it’s because he can’t see that well
anymore and doesn’t want to admit it” (AK to JS, 3 October 1948, PASP,
Box 58).
In addition to his struggles with the material, the publisher had to postpone the printing and thus publishing several times due to the shortages of
the Second World War. Scripta Minoa II, the volume that Sir Arthur Evans
started to compile around 1910, was finally completed in 1952. The whole
decipherment had to be done with only one ninth of the existing inscriptions
at hand.

“Sometimes, we catch glimpses of one another through the jungle of ignorance. Occasionally our paths cross, and we can stop and exchange notes”

April 1948, PASP, Box 55.2).
There were moments in my archival work when the distance between
Alice Kober’s and my own life collapsed into an unlikely proximity and
eventually produced a sound of mutuality. The first of these moments was
when I understood that Alice Kober’s mother tongue was German. Even
though her parent’s immigration papers state “Hungary” as their previous
country of residence, it referred to Austria­Hungary at that time.
The second moment was when I read in Alice’s birth certificate that her
mother’s maiden name was Gruber—my grandmother’s sister married into a
Gruber family, but they were from Silesia. It was seconds spent in a something like electric shock, the forehead prickling in anticipation. What if it
wasn’t for a long string of chance that I became interested in Alice Kober?
What if her life was inscribed in my own from the beginning, against all
odds?

Wandering—Literary Field
──
192
We [women] don’t manufacture word­objects, no cans, no jewel boxes,
no ‘book’. We create paths, in movements” (Cixous 1980 [1977]: 20, my
translation).
The practice part of this research is about writing which is intended as a
journey rather than a book (being linear, being consistent, being whole). It is
about meandering between the inner and outer worlds, between what can be
addressed with words and what can’t. It is writing between bodies and languages.
I had to translate the Cixous quote above, which so lightly and whimsically sums up my aims and methods for this research, from German to English, because hours and hours of internet and library catalogue queries didn’t
amount to anything—I simply cannot find the English translation of the
1979 Cixous article Poétique e(s)t le politique which appeared, allegedly, as
Poetry Is/and (the) Political in a journal called Bread and Roses in 1980. I
have given up on it, hungry and empty­handed.
The German version of the second sentence is highly ambiguous: we
create paths, we create in movements. Or: we create paths by moving
through the landscape (of our thoughts). Or: we, as part of our work as organised, connected and compassionate subjects make way for the moving of
the world in a direction we are appreciative of. Or: our making is at the root
of itself. Because as we are wandering, we are creating paths. The paths are
neither an aim nor a prerequisite of our moving in the world, maybe not
even a consequence, but a legacy.
For the writing of the practice part, the notion of being on my way while
at the same time creating this way was formative. Not having to think of the
book yet, not creating useful or precious objects (sentences, images), just
committing myself to writing where the writing hand would lead me.
The literary positions I see as related to this endeavour (I am talking
about books in which the wandering process of their creation is somehow
──
193
inscribed), embrace the notion of a journey, immerse themselves in the qualities of the absent present and stress the need for openness and plurality of
voices in writing. In the following, I will briefly talk about three books
whose authors seem to have used similar strategies to mine. They are incredibly powerful and poetic narratives which allow the reader to wander
off to places that could not be reached otherwise, to create their own path in
the landscape of silence.

“When I tell my grandfather
I am writing about Jane, he says,
What will it be, a figment
of your imagination?
We are eating awful little pizzas
and my mother is into
the boxed wine. I don’t know
what to say. I wish
I could show him: between
figling (a little fig)
and figure lies
figment, from fingere, meaning
to form.”
(Nelson 2005: 23)
──
195
Forming meaning by forming figures from what they left behind. No
gloomy sweet juice of certainty dripping from the hand that writes. Forming
meaning where there are only fractions left: In Jane. A Murder Maggie Nelson retraces the murder of her mother’s sister Jane, who was killed in 1969,
aged 23. Even though she is thought to be the victim in a series of seven
rape­murders, she was not raped. She was shot twice in her head, once from
the front and once from the back (see Nelson 2005: 17, 129).
Nelson interweaves poems like the one quoted above about details of her
search, of the case, of conversations with family members and Phil, Jane’s
boyfriend at the time, with excerpts from Jane’s diaries and other material
like newspaper articles, letters to the editor and dictionary snippets. As she
states in her preamble to the book, she navigates between what has
happened according to witnesses and her family and how she tells it: “Also,
although this is a ‘true story’, I make no claim for the factual accuracy of its
representations of events or individuals” (Nelson 2005).
When I began reading Jane. A Murder in New York in 2017—more or
less by accident (while I had read and infinitely enjoyed The Argonauts and
Bluets, Jane was not a deliberate continuation of reading Nelson, but a
chance find in the Strand bookstore), I knew I had found the book which
was closest to what I wanted to do in my text about Alice Kober. The similitude is the approach of layering different voices and sources to examine a
“real” incident, to follow a person that had really lived. The major difference is that Nelson is, even though she had never met her aunt, being born
four years after her death, related to her subject’s story—her grandfather accidentally calling her “Jane” occasionally (Nelson 2005: 37), entangled
through the family’s way of dealing with or refusing to deal with the traumatic situation of their daughter’s/sister’s murder. Maggie Nelson writes
from the inside, also piecing together her own story.
Even though Alice Kober’s story is not my own story, the process of being in her archive and writing about her is. This is how, for me, the project is
──
196
different from the multitude of biographies or biographically­inspired novels
that exist and that interlocutors keep recommending I read: I am not making
claims about accuracy, strictly speaking, I am making claims about inaccuracy. The certainty of not being able to know is what underpins my writing.
In this aspect I am going further than Maggie Nelson, as I’m consciously incorporating alternative versions of events, of attributions. I am not producing a linear narrative about Alice Kober. I am writing a narrative about my
search for her, which creates a space in which the findings from the archive
and other documents can resonate with my own experience as a woman, as a
reader, as a writer.
The notion of creating a texture rather than a text that represents a life
and all the struggles which come with living it can be found, for example, in
Theresa Hak Kyung Cha’s book Dictee, in which she tells her own story
alongside her mother’s story, the Korean revolutionary Yu Guan Soon and
the Greek Muses. She incorporates historic documents, handwriting and
photographs into her own prose texts and poems, between English and
French. As a reader who is unfamiliar with Korean history, I continue to be
surprised and, at times, irritated. I am listening to a story full of religious
and historical references, I have to reread passages multiple times, I can’t
summarise the book any better than stating that it is a journey to the author’s
own roots in culture, in belief, but also in a history of exile and oppression,
of deprived language, of having to deny one’s identity. The debarment experience translates and repeats itself gently when I come across the pages
featuring calligraphy, with no note to say what the signs mean. The power of
the text is that it recreates, inside me, the feeling of being on my own, of
navigating a realm unknown to me, following rules without understanding
them.
──
197
“Tell me the story
Of all these things.
Beginning wherever you wish, tell even us.”
(Cha 2001: 11)
The third book I consider to be an important artistic reference for my
project is 13 Presidents by Marisa J. Futernick (2016), which does not work
with different sorts of (found) texts like Maggie Nelson or even different
media like Cha, but brings together text and photography. The author is a
multimedia artist who went on a journey to the birthplaces, houses and
grave sites of 13 US presidents. She documented this journey in photographs, which complement the short stories that she wrote, one about each
president. They are fictional stories featuring the presidents, their colleagues, their wives and children, but as the setting is authentic, and known
facts about the presidents are touched on, and the stories even incorporate,
in italic, passages which could be taken from diaries, letters or the like
(there is no reference list), the line between fiction and reality is constantly
blurred. As Futernick can rely on the fact that her readers know the presidents (even though in her preamble she claims that “any similarities between
these stories and the reality of any person living or dead are unintended”)
she has many ways to be playful about the subjects of her story and how
they are seen from today’s perspective. The playfulness and the echoing or
altering how a person is perceived is an aspect that writing about Alice
Kober does not provide. Her story and the decipherment’s story aren’t
known to many readers. The task is to make it accessible in the first place,
not to deform it.
What reading Futernick’s text has showed me is the lightness and dauntlessness with which she invents or re­invents her characters and their relationships. She doesn’t explain or legitimate her fictional work. The figments
of her imagination are grounded through her photographs, which show how
──
198
the places that were important in the real presidents’ lives look today. The
space in which the question of fiction’s matter is discussed lies in between
the text and the pictures. The book is, like my undertaking, a narrative of a
journey, but Futernick examines in hers the roots of a nation’s identity and
dreams, the patterns of duty and power, the images of blistering success
against the backdrop of stale rurality.
What all the three books have in common is that they offer multi­voiced
accounts of historical events, challenging the existing narratives through a
personal perspective. They are all written by women which is, by no means,
coincidental; on the contrary, I am seeing this way of writing, which is more
than anything based on always already knowing that language and the structures it represents are not innocent, a writing which thus doubts the all­toowell­defined, the all­too­facile at the core of the feminist (or “féminine”,
following Cixous’ term) way of artistically encountering the world. One
way among many others to celebrate plurality, to include voices otherwise
unheard.

“The basic distinction between fact and theory is clear enough: a fact is
a reality, an actuality, something that exists; a theory states that something
might be, or could be, or should be. Like most simple statements, the foregoing has implications that are far from simple. In dealing with the past we
are concerned, not with something that exists, but with something that has
existed. Our facts are limited to those things from the past which still exist;
everything else is theory, which may range all the way from practical certainty to utter impossibility, depending on its relationship to known facts.”
—Alice Kober, The Minoan Scripts: Fact and Theory, 1948

You weren’t there, Alice, so all I was concerned with was how I might,
could, or should be able to find you.
“Writing is an ambivalent movement. Writing separates, isolates, retreats. There is the danger of an ivory tower. But there also is the necessity
to inscribe, to offer resistance to death, erasure and silence. Writing is a
practice of life. […] It is about showing oblivion its limits. We mustn’t write
in order to forget but to remind ourselves to remember. Don’t forget yourself, don’t forget the Other(s)” (Cixous 1980 [1977]: 13, my translation).

The journey to you, Alice, is a train ride, is an observation car, is hinterland, is crumbly sleep and folding bed skirmish. The journey to you, Alice,
is in essence a question: What can be found if all is lost? Are traces left of
you as a woman, as a daughter, as a lover? Possibly, on the back or in the
margins, sentences which have gone astray, secretly preserved in the moment of oblivion?

It took 48 hours from New York City to Austin, Texas. The train was, as
expected, the means of transport for melancholiacs: one spins round in the
panorama car seat, one stares at a cocktail glass, one enjoys the advantages
of gravity in general. One is a veteran, a policewoman, a pensioner, a birdwatcher or a volunteer storyteller. One has slept or has not, one had some
warm water left while taking a shower or had not, one had been served the
right food or had not. What united us all was the cracking of the vertebrae
when we greeted each other.
Grand Central Station in New York is a building of such size that from
time to time, smaller celestial bodies patter from the ceiling onto the polished marble tiles. The station in Austin is a combined waiting and counter
room next to the tracks: plywood, plaster boards, cicadas. The officer at the
counter takes note of the fact that my luggage is missing. “Tomorrow evening,” he says, “the next train is arriving tomorrow evening and I bet they’ll
have it on board”. My need for greater commitment makes him pick up the
phone after a while: he dials, it rings, he breathes, “believe me, Miss,” he repeats and hangs up, “same time tomorrow”.
Right after my arrival on campus, I am handed the key for the archive
rooms in the basement of the Department of Ancient Philology. I learn how
to activate the alarm when I leave the archive last, which will be the case almost every night. I am the ghost who knows the code: hashtag, 1, 9, 3, 9. I
would have preferred the end of the war.

When Two People Independently Wonder About the Same
Thing: Franklin Daniel I

15 November 1941 –––––PASP
Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
Dear Dr. Daniel:
The following pages contain the various points that occurred to me
when I read your article through again to­day, and considered what you
said there together with what I remembered you saying a year ago at the
AJA meeting and yesterday. I decided that while I was doing it, I might as
well do it thoroughly, and the result was so bulky I had to write on manifold
paper.
[First draft:]
Dear Dr. Daniel:
Before I start with my threatened list of queries on your article, I want
to make it clear that I do not do it in a spirit of criticism, but because I feel
that you, like me, want to make some headway with a problem which is fascinating because it is practically insoluble, and any slightest error when
one is dealing with unknowns may throw one off the right track.
──

18 November 1941 –––––PASP
Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
Dear Miss Kober,
First of all I want to thank you for writing me so fully about your evidence for Linear B and related problems. I sent a number of reprints to
various people (and am now sending one to you) in the hope of getting some
constructive criticism on some of the many aspects of this work on which I
do not pretend to have more than a minimum of knowledge. You are the first
person who has done anything other than say that it looks wonderful, which
of course means that it doesn’t interest them. The remark that I made facetiously at the start of my lecture is perfectly true: if I am expressing myself
on this subject, it is only because of the accident of having excavated new
material, and because in preparing this material for publication I realized
that little as I knew, I could nevertheless correct some misapprehensions in
previous work.
In conclusion let me say that I am very much impressed by your command of your material, and look forward to hearing you at the Christmas
meetings.

21 November 1941 –––––PASP
Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
Dear Mr. Daniel:
I am chagrined, humiliated and absolutely disgusted with myself because, in writing to you, I did exactly what I have so often bitterly criticized
others for doing, namely, I made statements without checking all the available evidence. You are entirely right when you say in several places in your
letter, that what guided you in making a certain suggestion was the use of a
sign, rather than its superficial resemblance to another. In dealing with any
sort of hand­writing, use is the only safe criterion. In all the scripts I know,
the difference between two letters which represent entirely different sounds,
is often so minor that it might escape any but the most critical eye when the
would­be reader does not know the language involved. On the other hand, it
is also true that great variations exist, even in a single line written by one
hand. I myself have two variations of r and e and I seem to use them indiscriminately, even in the same word.
──
209
In the beginning, I too couldn’t tell which were variants of the same letters; in the beginning, your hand looked like the sea to me. I followed the
tide, I read like a child, letter by letter, sometimes quietly mad, like someone
who has misplaced their reading glasses. But then, after having been a little
boat for a while, floating on the surface, I got into your habit of misplacing
the slashes, for example. I realised that while your logic was extremely
sharp, your hand was gentler, more erratic. Your hand, traced by this incredibly fine blue ink waves, washing up on the off­white of the paper.

I agree with you that much more progress can be made when those of us
working in the different fields get together. I’d like nothing better than to
take part in a symposium such as you suggest. This interchange of ideas
with you has already given me several new clues. What is only a vague hypothesis when one person thinks of it, becomes an idea worth pursuing to its
end when it turns out that someone else got the same idea from different material.
──
211
Getting an idea from a hypothesis, getting an idea from someone else’s
voice or thoughts, getting an idea from a magpie outside the window. Getting an idea from the neighbour’s footprints in the snow. Getting an idea
from the pattern that coffee leaves behind in the cup, getting an idea from
the slice of sky that is visible through the bedroom window, getting an idea
from the way your mother always walks a bit unevenly.
You see, it was you too, who wanted exchange, who wanted collaboration. I don’t know why it’s presented how it was Ventris’ invention1
. It doesn’t take fancy new ideas, just one person and another. When they talk, something inside the body is aligned, something that had never existed before.

Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
I look forward to seeing what progress you make with the ideograms. I
am also very anxious to see your paper on the suffixes. We must try to get
Blegen and his co­workers into a discussion at Hartford, and see what common ground we can find. Blegen himself, as you probably know, is very reticent, and hates to suggest anything until he is absolutely certain of it. A
young man, however, whose name I can’t recall, who is working with Blegen
on the tablets, is much more prone to the discussion of half­formulated
ideas; we may be able to get something from him.
Thank you again for writing, and do it whenever you have any questions
or anything you wish to pass on. It is very welcome.

In Flatbush, Brooklyn, I had visited your house, if you can really say
that: I stood in front of it and didn’t dare ring the bell. How could I summarise, in a few words, why I wanted to be admitted? There is no plaque, no
sign, no reference to you. Only a handful of people know: Alice Kober,
American classical philologist and leading international researcher in the deciphering of Linear B, lived here. Then, if I managed to do it and I was invited in, what would I find after 70 years of your absence? After multiple
changes of ownership, of generations, of interior styles? I tore a page out of
my notebook and wrote:
Hi. I am Regina, a writer based in Switzerland and I’m researching Alice
Kober, who lived in this house with her mother, Katharina Kober, in the
1930s and 40s. I’d very much like to see the inside of the house. Please give
me a call if you could imagine letting me peek around your home. Of
course, I’d gladly tell you more about Alice Kober.
Quietly, I climbed the two steps of the veranda and realised that there
was no letter box on the front door, nor in the wall next to it, and no freestanding mailbox on the curb. I liked the fact that house number 1050 in
East 43rd Street seemed to survive without mail, but it was also slightly mysterious—bills, contracts, books. I stuck the note between the door leaf and
the frame, where it was bent by the wind. “You wish,” the wind whispered,
“there’s no way that’s going to last.”
Good afternoon. If I were standing in your living room, I would remove
the wallpaper in my imagination while answering your question about why I
am interested in Alice Kober. After all I am neither a classical philologist
nor an archaeologist. I don’t even know Ancient Greek. It was like this: I
came across Alice because I followed a footnote. A footnote in which Linear
B was mentioned. In what kind of book this reference might have been necessary I can’t say, not by any stretch of the imagination. All I remember
was that I was curious about what a font called Linear B might look like.
──
214
A bit like the capital letters of our own writing. There is a sign like a
mirrored S, and an L with a circle, where the lines form a corner. Another
one looks like an elephant with its trunk thrown back. There are also signs
that stand for a whole word: man, woman, horse, pig, clothes, cart, fabric.
The man is a long triangle, on top a horizontal line for the arms, on top of
the arms a small line for the head. The woman is a long triangle, on top a
horizontal line for the arms, below two dots as breasts, above a semicircle
for a head.
Good afternoon. Actually, it’s so unlikely that I came across Alice that I
secretly assume that she was the one who found me. Why me of all people?
Because I too am a woman: line, dot, dot. Because we resemble each other
in our stubbornness. Because she knew that if she just made me curious
enough, I would follow her traces. I would travel to the US, first to New
York and from there, as a visiting scholar, to the University of Texas at Austin, where her archive landed through a certain set of coincidences. She
knew that I would be willing to read every single letter there, every document, every article, every sheet. Line by line, dot by dot. She knew that I
would want to write about her, that this writing about would very soon become a form of writing towards each other.
──
215
Good afternoon. If I was sure the wind would blow my note away, I’d
write this: was it on a Saturday that you dismantled the mailbox and removed its traces? Did you have slippers on and a taste of bread in your
mouth? Do you know more since it is quiet? Or different?
Maybe you’re right, maybe silence is a good start. The best beginning,
for everything.

30 January 1942 ––––––PASP
Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
Dear Alice
I have been meaning for some time to write to tell you how impressed I
was by your article on words in ­inthos. It really is monumental.
I haven’t heard a word from or about Bennett. I gathered at Hartford
that he did plan to publish fairly soon, but I may be wrong about that. When
you do get the vowels in order, do give me at least an inkling of your results.
I think that is a crucial point in the history of writing in Greece.
──
217
Sometimes it’s disappointing to look up new words in order to get a language right. It’s in these moments that I’d like to command the words to extend the promise they make to me—the susurrus just between myself and
the letters, their order, their silhouette—to densely written dictionary pages.
Under these circumstances the word “inkling” does derive from the noun
“ink”, and means “a tiny bit of writing that sums up great efforts of
thought”, or “some wavy lines thrown on manifold paper like a stone in the
almost motionless Ionian Sea on any weekday afternoon.”

12 May 1942 ––––––––––PASP
Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
Dear Alice,
I must apologize for not having written sooner: for once in my brief career I have been swamped with curatorial duties. I don’t even try to write
letters at home: spring on a farm is a very busy season.
I need hardly tell you how delighted I was to hear you say that [two
signs] may be vowel signs after all.
No, I’m not in the army, thanks to a dependent wife. I have been trying
to find some part­time use for my knowledge of Greece and Modern Greek,
but so far to no avail.
I assume that you heard Blegen’s NY lecture. I wish that I might have. I
saw him at the A.P.A. meetings long enough to learn that the Pylos inscriptions are in Minoan, which must have been the literary language, while the
spoken language at Pylos was Greek. It sounds reasonable.
──
219
A very reasonable idea, indeed. You were so close, in this sentence, to
the final solution, both of you: one writing, one following the words with
their eyes—inklingreen, inklingblack. There it was: Greek and Minoan so
closely linked, but neither of you raised the easier solution which doesn’t require two languages—one spoken, one written—but just one. I must apologise for the impatience, but: Did either of you consider Greek to be the answer at some point?

Dear Franklin,
When I didn’t hear from you I decided that you were in the army and it
was with pleasure that I noted that your letter came from the museum. Tell
your wife I am grateful to her for keeping you where I can write you about
my findings once in a while.
──
221
Tell your wife I am grateful that her hands are too small or just not numerous enough to tame nature’s constitution, that her muscles get sore way
too fast, that her body is mainly made of connective tissue. Maybe she
coughs a lot, maybe she is always cold. Maybe she drinks tea she brews
from herbs that she collected herself in the underwood. Maybe she has bad
dreams every other night, maybe she is awake all the time, cradling a child
or her fears or her pride at having hair the colour of marsh marigolds, maybe
she tosses and turns in her sleep until she is wet with sweat, buried under
snow. Maybe, secretly, she sometimes cannot get up from the kitchen chair
for fear of touching stone, touching wood, touching metal in the wrong order. Maybe sometimes she cannot drag herself out of bed because her whole
life seems folded into the bedside lamp, every little action, even the smallest
task is suddenly sitting there, beside her and mocking her. Would you tell
her, please, that I am grateful for that.

Yes, I certainly heard Blegen, and, what’s more, he showed slides of at
least three inscriptions I had never seen before, so I considered it a perfect
evening.
──
225
Why does the knowledge always fall into their laps, those territories of
leeriness and pride. Showing their slides like magicians at a fair, but still
with hands that can snatch you blatantly. Knowing, just knowing, that they
are doing this out of generosity, sharing what has fallen to their ground, their
pockets, their pipes. Not even raising their voice, not even clearing their
throats. Still they make a tiny pause, just enough to give the audience time
to hold their breath, to feel their lungs start to prickle. Then, they point with
the stick onto the wall where the slide is projected, the sticks, the men, the
verticals. Helena had rewarded Blegen with the palace and the inscriptions
in Pylos because he had decided not to cut down the century­old olive trees
and dig somewhere other than planned. This is the story2
, and he couldn’t
help telling it again, but it remained unclear if he was showing respect or he
knew that he could dig wherever the hell he wanted to and something eternal would surface, cocksure.

22 May 1942 ––––––––––PASP
Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
Dear Franklin:
One of these days I’m coming to Philadelphia and do away with you,
because you are a dangerous character. As I work away I get
“brainstorms” which I store away in my mind for future reference, and
sooner or later, you write to me and wonder whether so and so couldn’t perhaps be the case. Seriously, I am delighted, of course, because when two
people independently wonder about the same thing, there is so much more
probability that there is something in it.
I find some very interesting things. Certain signs are often prefixed, or
suffixed, to roots. Some are often intrusive. I have some roots. Pretty soon
I’ll be able to conjugate or decline them, but I still can’t read them.
Whenever you write and tell me that you just haven’t the time to spend
on Cypro­Minoan, I feel sad, and then brighten up at the reflection that you
probably can’t really tear yourself away entirely. I can’t. I’ve tried several
times, but it’s a no go. I’ve resigned myself; if I want peace I must first finish
the job, or work till someone else finishes it.
I envy you. Your work is related to your field of interest. I have to teach
beginners Latin, or read papers in which I am told that the inner frieze of
the Parthenon portrays the Panatheistic Procession. ’Tain’t funny! Not
when I spent a period describing and discussing the durn thing!
I’m looking forward to hearing you again. I’ll sit in the front row (I
mean the second—the front row is reserved for the big shots) and make
faces.
──
227
The first letter you exchanged with Franklin was six months ago. Six
months of thorough scrutiny of theories, six months of getting used to this
other mind that can be addressed, this other being on University stationary.
Only one week after he mentions his wife, you seem on your way to him.
She’s dependent, you are not. When you write this letter, bubbly and cheerful, you cannot know that it will remain unanswered for a long time—almost four years. You cannot know that you will feel embarrassed for months
on end, you wish you had kept a carbon copy to check your words again, if
they were indeed as pathetic as their echoes in your head. You imagine him
chuckling at your lines or digging trenches in Normandy, and then you stop
the thinking about him altogether—whenever he comes up in your mind,
you push him through a barn door (a red one, like that from the children’s
book) and then you lock it shut. The key is warm in your hand, warm and
balanced and rugged.

1 See for example Robinson’s account of the Mid­Century Report (2002: 75): “The
‘venture’—which Ventris also called an ‘interesting experiment in international
cooperation’ and which soon became known as the Mid­Century Report—was
wholly typical of him. No professional classicist would have conceived it, and if
one had, he or she would almost certainly have lacked the linguistic skills to
translate the replies, which came from all over Europe and the United States. It was
‘group working’ applied to a completely different field, the decipherment of the
Minoan scripts, in a disinterested effort to break the scholarly impasse.”
2 “As the story went, Blegen arrived in Pylos in April 1939 and looked around for
a place to dig. He chose a nearby hill and asked its owner if he could excavate
there. Permission was granted on one condition: that Blegen’s workmen not disturb
the ancient olive trees growing on the hillside. Blegen agreed to dig a meandering
trench that would spare the trees. As a result, he liked to say afterward, Pallas
Athene, the Greek goddess of wisdom, who had given man the olive tree, rewarded
him. Early the next morning, Blegen’s greek workmen began digging the crooked
trench. Almost at once, one of the men approached him, holding up an object he
had lifted from the earth. ‘Grammata,’ he said, extending his hand to Blegen. In the
man’s hand was a clay tablet, much like those from Knossos, inscribed with similar
symbols.” (Fox 2013: 146­7).

A Fragile Sequence:
Caesura
──
230
I think it was a Monday night. The library was open till late, and I
needed a break from writing, so I checked something online. I then checked
something else, and eventually I happened to read this sentence about Luce
Irigaray on Encyclopaedia Britannica online: “Irigaray was circumspect
about revealing details of her personal life or upbringing; she believed that
interpreters and critics within the male­dominated academic establishment
typically use such information to distort or dismiss the work of challenging
women thinkers.”
I heard her (even though I didn’t know her voice back then) joining you
in calling me a camel, gently, laughingly. For such a long time, her idea of
meeting in silence had been the guiding star for this research, and now she
was circumspect. How could I convince her and myself to continue? Obviously, the male­dominated academic establishment couldn’t and wouldn’t
use whatever I was writing against you, for they had moved on long ago.
But still, I am attributing, making decisions, exemplifying, simplifying,
amplifying. I am replacing the silence with matter: particles, particularities.
──
231
Words.
──
232
I have been carrying your letters and writings inside me for well over a
year, and sometimes I feel like I can’t run or move quickly, as that would
swirl them up, displace the words I know so well, disturb the natural order
they have taken, a fragile sequence which would collapse when being
spoken of.
I don’t know what they’ve been doing inside, your words, all these
months. There was no whispering, no rattling, neither day nor night time.
My guess is they were silently pointing to the poles, quietly re­arranging
themselves like rough­edged ghosts, according to the movements of my
hands.
──
233
All I can do is write to leave your words inside. I write reverberations,
wordily echo soundings. I write into the dark of my body and into the dark
of your body, too.

I shall Never, While I’m Alive, Desist:
Voice
──
235
I’m sitting at my desk in the archive with my usual late­night snack: a
protein shake from the gym bar as none of the coffee places are open this
late. The cold cup plucks water from the air like mediocre ideas and they
gather on the transparent cell wall. Of course I shouldn’t be endangering the
documents, the thin carbon paper on which the violet is already blurring. I
throw away the cup with the ice cubes and read on in the folder that contains, among other things, your application for the Guggenheim Fellowship
(PASP, Box 56.6). In the section “In Connection with Other College Organizations”, I read:
Talk on Roman Drama on radio (1936) as preface to Dr. Arnold Moss’
presentation of The Menaechmi
──
236
And all the others had left for the day quite a while ago, and so I can’t
tell anyone that there is a possible trace here, the opportunity of proximity.
Your voice, with which I share my mother tongue, German, the language of
a minority in Prague. That you spoke it to your parents is a secure state of
knowledge: your pronunciation of English had a strong German accent,
someone would write much later.1
 Your voice. A voice that can be a place, a
promise, a world.
I can adore a voice: I am a woman: the love of the voice: nothing
is more powerful than the intimate touch of a veiled voice, profound
but reserved coming to awaken my blood; the first ray of a voice that
comes to meet the newly­born heart. My heart is in the belongingness with a voice fashioned out of shining darkness, a nearness infinitely tender and reserved. (Cixous 2003 [1979]: 84)
The hope of being able to call over to another world—me to you, or you
to me. The exuberance of having tracked down a so­far undiscovered document, an overlooked testimony. The thought of hearing you speak over a
good eighty years wraps itself around me like a small blanket of carbon dioxide.

Archive Request –––––
New York Public Radio
I’m looking for the episode The Menaechmi from the show Theater
Parade, a radio program prepared and directed by the student body and faculty of Brooklyn College, which was broadcast on Friday, February 21,
1936, probably at 4.30 pm. I’m especially interested in the featured speaker,
Dr. Alice Kober.
Dear Ms. Duerig,
I’m sorry to report this is not a recording we have in our collection and
this predates the station’s 1937 WPA make­over when they acquired disc
cutting/recording machines. So, I have my doubts about it being recorded at
all.
Sincerely yours,
Andy Lanset, Director of Archives
New York Public Radio
Dear Mr. Lanset
Thank you very much for your quick reply! It’s a pity that the recording doesn’t exist. I was so excited… I might ask the Brooklyn College
just to be sure, but if the technical equipment wasn’t at disposal, as you
point out, the chances are very slim.
One final attempt to clutch at a straw: if the old recordings are somehow
tagged & it wouldn’t take you too long, could I ask you to check if Alice
Kober was on air (and recorded) for another show? (She died in May 1950,
so it would have been between 1937 and 1950.) I don’t think she was, but
there’s so little information about her that it could be possible.
──
238
Dear Ms. Dürig,
I’ve checked our catalog as well as the NYC Municipal Archives
WNYC collection—which contains the bulk of our older shows—neither is
showing anything for “Kober”. Sorry.
There’s always a chance she had asked/paid for a commercial recording
service at the time to record her appearance off the air. Those types of discs
typically turn up in institutional/university collections of the individual’s
donated personal papers. So, if her papers were donated somewhere, it
might be worth checking that out.
Dear Mr. Lanset
Unfortunately, or fortunately, I’m sitting amidst her papers, so to speak.
I’ve spent the last four weeks going through all that there is, but have only
found a tiny hint at the show in a CV, no disc at all…

“DOKTÈRKOBÈR, WOULD YOU allow me the pleasure of having dinner
with you later? I could imagine that you like French food as much as I
myself.” Moss threw this smile at her that she had seen him sending out
to almost all female teachers, it had nearly always been reciprocated, shy
yet beaming. He couldn’t even pronounce her name correctly, but at
least, in her case, he was close.
“Where are we supposed to be standing?” asked a student with a
ponytail, excited by the idea that her voice, trained by crumbly singing
teachers and overambitious actors without real engagement all these
hours after school, was soon to be heard in thousands of homes in New
York City. Her hip tilted impatiently, “Over here?”
Moss started to turn towards her, sending his stretched arm out first
so that his eyes could still rest on Alice, his eyebrows almost a caricature
of a question mark, horizontal dashes of expectation.
“Please, Doktèrkobèr, I have never had the chance to hear the opinion of a Roman expert on the play.”
Was he bowing to her? Alice sounded in his mouth like a dubious pill.
But the word expert made her move her head sideways and down, even
though she was neither an expert on Rome nor on plays, but maybe she
could shift the conversation to Horace2
, Roman poetry she knew, a nod
so slow that it could have been no, seen with eyes other than Moss’s.
“Impeccable,” he said, sending out his voice to the far corner of the
known universe, now fully positioned towards the student, “I would be
delighted.”
──
240
Alice’s torso flashed with inward heat, a red of reluctance, when she
caught the student’s look—the same that Alice used to forbear when women gave in to all too obvious advances. For a second she hoped the student had also heard the word expert, but it might have been exactly this
word that gave Moss away. Then Alice saw how the student was tilting
her hip in the other direction, her eyes determined like a double flamed
fen fire, Castor and Pollux would have been proud of her. It had not been
contempt, it had been a warning, Alice thought, and started to breathe
again, deep and soft. Being a bitter pill of intelligence, who wouldn’t
agree to that?

THE MICROPHONE LOOKED like a tea strainer that had decided to become a cargo ship, but had abandoned its transformation halfway. It was
shiny. Alice ran her fingers over the meshed metal.
“Don’t,” harrumphed the technician, “talk with the mouth.” His neck
was badly shaved and a sweaty dew covered his nose and forehead.
“Yes, sir,” Alice repeated softly, “I will talk with my mouth.” She felt
her heart echo in her throat. Usually, his nonsensical proposal would
have reassured her, nothing so warm and enveloping as a mind focused
on the certainties of the world, as if walking on a layer of solid glass
above all the others, the junctions, the assumptions, the sea. The technician put his headphones on and snapped his fingers in front of the microphone, checking the amplitude described by the little needles in their
half-moon cases.
“You haven’t done this before, Miss?” Without turning away from
the bulky black box and its control knobs, he provided all the oracle-like
advice he thought Alice worthy of: “Take your voice from your stomach.
Don’t turn your head away under any circumstance. The less you think
about it, the better you will sound, Miss.”
“Sure. I will try my best.” Alice’s heartbeat amplified itself into her
arms, into the sheet of paper. In the early morning hours, she had typed
them up for the very last time, incorporating all her corrections
dangling on long lines from the words they referred to. She read her introduction to herself in front of the bathroom mirror after her mother
had gone to bed. At first, the movements of her duplicated herself irrit­
──
242
ated her. Then, the words started to materialise in between the two
Alices, as if choosing from which mouth to emerge. Alice had looked herself in the eye reciting what had to be said about this quaint play. She
watched her thin lips, the lines between the nostrils and the corners of
the mouth changing their angle ever so slightly. Words dangling again,
this time from her face. She couldn’t help but laugh at herself, the gurgling dryness of her voice aseptically reflected back on the yellowish
bathroom tiles. One cannot look with one’s mouth.

We distinguish between two types of Roman comedies—those based on
Greek plays, and those written for Roman circumstances. “The Twins” by
Plautus is a fabula palliata, based on Greek themes. The whole play takes
place on the street in front of a house, as is typical of ancient comedies. A
place of arrival and departure, of presence and absence. A place of encounter.
There are plenty of encounters in this piece. It tells the story of a pair of
twins, the Menaechmi, who look very similar to each other. As children they
were separated from each other. When they had grown up, the righteous one
of the two set forth to look for the other. Stubbornly, the righteous one did
not want to realise that his venture was unsuccessful, that he had to go back
home with the last of his money, and this is exactly where he gets caught up
in the life of his not evil but indecent twin brother. The righteous Menaechmus meets his brother’s wife and mistress, who confront him. The indecent
one encounters the servant of the righteous brother and releases him to his
freedom. Only at the end of the play do the brothers finally meet and all
their confusion dissolves upon their reunion.

IT WAS THE whole acting class that Moss took to a French restaurant,
girls and boys like grapes around him. Led by some movement she couldn’t reconstruct Alice ended up sitting next to Moss, his left arm resting
on the back of her chair. Precisely because he was opening his body in
her direction, she was shut off. Sitting next to him but not looking at
him, leaning forward to not touch his arm, like a doll on the day its owner finally realised she was too old to play with it but couldn’t yet let go of
the habit of taking the little stuffed body everywhere she went. Alice
couldn’t even move her chair an inch, so crowded was the table, the
whole restaurant in fact. Even though she must have walked past it
many times, she had never seen it. La Semaine Passée, what a pretentious name. The students’ voices were shrill with excitement, congratulating each other on their performances, pointing out which lines had
been delivered better than ever before and which mistakes went unnoticed by everybody else.
“Some say live broadcasting is like drinking champagne,” said Moss,
“but I believe that only drinking champagne is like drinking champagne.” Everybody laughed. This was a play, too, thought Alice, just
poorly written and presented in an uncomfortable theatre. She could
have been home by now, she could be reading. Moss removed his arm to
receive a bottle of champagne brought to him by the waiter, making a
great fuss about the little wire cage around the cork and talking about
how champagne, following French etymology, had to be opened with a
sabre. Playing a French nobleman with his arm as a blade, Moss knocked
──
245
over the glasses the waiter had just put on the table. The students were
screaming at the feather-edged disorder and Moss cut his finger while
picking up the glass remains. Then, the cork shot out of the bottle of its
own accord, hitting the ceiling and finally landing in a bread basket.
After a second of silence everybody broke out in frenetic applause, and
Moss got up and took a round of bows. Alice, too, got up from the table,
her purse clutched in her hands. Nobody will ever notice that I am gone,
she thought. In fact, I should never have been here in the first place.
“Are you feeling unwell?” asked Moss, his index finger in his mouth
to stop the bleeding.
“I’m not much of a bubbly woman,” said Alice in a jejune voice, feeling her limbs turn to wool.
“Do you think I need a Band-Aid?” asked Moss, holding his finger in
front of Alice’s face. She saw how a dot of blood became a red pearl, then
a line.
“I’m not an expert on that,” Alice said, “but I’m sure you will be fine.
Thanks for the invitation to this peculiar place.”
The students were pouring the champagne.
“Please stay, Doktèrkobèr,” Moss said in another voice, deeper and
breathless, “you played an important role this afternoon, too, you cannot refuse to be celebrated!”
He turned around to grab a glass, but was immediately caught in a
conversation. Alice moved herself through the tables and chairs, her
woollen belly and legs bumping clumsily into wood, into people. On the
street she turned into a human again. A human with a blood stain on her
blouse sleeve, a blood stain in the shape of a continent.
──
246
***
IT WAS A blouse she actually liked, with little ribbons for cuffs. Alice
stood outside the idiotic restaurant, still hearing the voices somersault.
She was empty, but not hungry. Or hungry but not for food. She thought
of her mother, sitting in front of the radio. She insisted on wearing her
glasses to listen to the radio for a reason unbeknownst to Alice. Sometimes she’d make a little joke about it, but mostly she’d just observe the
body that was so much like her own lean in overly intense concentration. As if the eyes could catch what escapes the ears. How is blood removed? Salt? Soap? Lye? Her mother will know. When did he even touch
her? And why did he bring her here, just to add another odd figure to his
quaint circus of followers? Alice pictured herself lurching on a unicycle,
throwing cheerfully coloured juggling balls at the ignorant student and
her ponytail. She chuckled. She should have known better.

HUÎTRES, MOULES, BOUILLABAISSE.
“It’s the old question, if ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat
what I see’,” said Alice into the silence hovering over the white table
cloth. Even though she had spoken more to herself than addressed her
words to Moss, the candle in between them on the table broke into a disproportional flare, like little fiery somersaults.
“Do you like what you see?” answered Moss and the flame solidified.
Cheeky traitor, thought Alice.
“I am more of a dessert eater myself,” said Alice, “and not too fond of
sea dwellers. You know, I am a firm believer in the earth and all the good
that comes from it.” Why was he even bothering to go out with her? He,
the actor, he, the voice. He, who everybody else holds their breath for
when he walks by. This hair, these eyes, this voice. All that whispering.
Alice wondered if he knew how often the female colleagues talked about
or thought of him. Dreaming. Fantasising.
“I’ve heard much about your passion, Doktèrkobèr. I’m afraid
everything here is rather freshly prepared and not many thousand years
old. But let’s order dessert, if that’s what you like. What would you recommend?” His voice and posture changed, as if a little door had been
opened in his chest. A door like that on those portable altars from the
middle ages. He was now soft or mild. He put the menu down and spread
his arms out on the table, an open embrace.
“I, well… It sure is impolite not to order a proper meal, n’est-ce pas?”
──
248
“That would be the advantage of moderate fame. People tend to refrain from letting you know what they think. But don’t worry, please. I
come here so often it is basically my home.”
Suddenly, a lot of matter was hurrying around in Alice’s head. The
letters on the menu went out of focus, then reappeared. She was falling
down the rabbit hole. How do other women do it? Why do they enjoy this
kind of interaction, where everything constantly shifts? Where you never know where you are or where you’re headed? He seemed considerate
and generous. Wasn’t that a good thing?
“I like Tarte Tartin,” Alice said finally, “it’s one of my favourites.”
“Very well then.” Moss ordered two Tarte Tartins, a cheese board
and a bottle of red wine in fairly fluent French and looked pleased with
himself when the waiter made sure there hadn’t been a misunderstanding. “So tell me, Doktèrkobèr, what is it that drives you to unravel the
past?”
“Understanding where we come from.” Usually people ask why questions, a whole series of them: Why do you do that, why is it important,
why had nobody done it before, why do you think you can. Why aren’t
you married, why aren’t you concerned. “There’s clear evidence
whenever the past is concerned. We might not be able to say what it
means, but it is distinct and manageable. The past is contained. The
present is, quite often, not.”
 Moss nodded. “But you can never be sure, with the past, that it
really was the way you imagine it, right? It’s you, it’s the archaeologists
who make the past. You are, so to speak, God, Doktèrkobèr. You create a
world.”
“It’s the evidence, not the archaeologists. I’ve never thought of myself as some sort of divine authority, especially not in matters concerning the progression of the planet.”
──
249
“But wouldn’t you make a great goddess? Look at you! Wouldn’t it be
something if you excavated the remains of the Kobercult? Little figures
with curly hair and pencils and statues and temples!”
“Then I’d need more training as an archaeologist, they don’t let dilettantes lead digs, I’m afraid.”
“Who ever heard of a goddess needing training? You would have all
the power, the power of knowledge. With eyes so much more blue than
Helena’s. Homer would sing your praise, and later there would be plays
about you. Plays that I could perform with the students!”
“If I ever find evidence for my cult, you will be the first one to know,
I promise.”
“The mortals would worship you, I am convinced. Let’s see.
Chouchou! If this mademoiselle was a goddess, wouldn’t you gladly worship her?” The waiter tried to keep himself occupied with the bottle of
wine and the glasses, but he smiled and said “oui”, exchanging a conspiratorial look with Alice, “bien sûr”.
Alice smiled back at him, grateful for his presence.

“THERE’S CARAMEL SAUCE on your blouse,” Moss said and was right.
It was, in fact, Alice’s favourite blouse, comfortable and remotely elegant
at the same time.
“Let me,” he said, dabbing his finger on her arm, licking it clean
thoughtlessly. “It’s an island,” he said, the finger out of his mouth by
now, “maybe a prophecy. This is the island you will be living happily
on.”
Alice couldn’t stop looking at her forearm, at the little brown territory that Moss had conquered. She drew her arm back. She didn’t want to
be someone else’s land. She didn’t want to be living happily. First and
foremost, not in the sense that was implied here—a useless woman on a
beach, porch or her side of the bed. A happy wife.
“Have you been to Greece?”
“I don’t want to—”
“Don’t want to go to Greece? You must be joking!”
“No. Yes. I mean, yes, I want to go to Greece. Athens. Europe.3
”
Enough headwords to spark Moss’s enthusiasm for Europe, for traveling.
Alice couldn’t follow his meandering comments about things he had read
about places he wanted to visit. Alice could feel the little island turning
slowly into fire, into ice, into stone. Droughts and floods. Years of poor
harvest and years of abundance. Isolation and fugacity. Alice could feel it
all amounting to the only obvious circumstance: another civilisation’s
downfall4

“If you had been searching for a needle, I do believe you would, long
ere this, have found the needle, if it were visible.”5
…the servant says to the righteous Menaechmus, the one who strives to
find his brother. And it is 1936, and it is not possible for you to know that
your search will continue for years to come, your search for meaning and
syllables and silver linings. You heard this sentence in the piece, you heard
the sentence, you heard the silicifying crunch in the spine of those who
shake their heads, who say those kinds of sentences, sentences that are
meant to make you abandon stubbornness and rigidity, to silence voices for
the common good, you heard: role model women and love of order. No I, no
U.
“I shall never, while I’m alive, desist.”6
…replies the good Menaechmus to his servant, and is right, even though
he does not know that the solution is only seconds away, the solution that
does not want to cross his mind. While you listen to the student say this sentence with an empty face, you do not know how long you will live. You hear
this sentence in the piece, and inside it underlines you. It marks everything
in which you are ready to believe, because it is everything you know.

Among the hundreds of thousands of cards cut out by hand that I have
seen in the archive, I found one that you have cut to size from a letter. The
date on which the letter was written is 8 May, it is clearly marked on the
back, 8 May 1950, the year in which you died. It was probably posted that
same day or maybe one day later, perhaps it arrived at your home on May
10 or 11. You have read it and, who knows, maybe answered it. Maybe it
was recovery wishes that you skimmed with scissors in your hand. You
made a card and noted a word on it. On 16 May, only five days later, you
were no longer alive.

At the time of Plautus, the stages were made of wood and so small that
the audience stood directly in front of the actors. The experience was immediate, every word intelligible, every emotion and gesture to see.
Did you like theatre, Alice? The exaggerated speaking, the emotional
states thrown through the room?
I hate all kinds of inventions.
I flinched every time I read about this dislike in your letters.
What do you know about my letters?
I was in the archives and I read them, and everything else I could understand. The details of the notebooks, the word lists, the frequency counts
were only roughly accessible to me.
Is there an archive?
In Texas. It’s like the Center for Minoan Studies you should have run at
the University of Pennsylvania. Anyway, all the material from that time
ended up in Texas.
Why?
Because your mother, after your—
Why did you read my letters?
Because I wanted to find what the early historians and other scientists
and biographers who wrote about you overlooked.
What would that be?
Something human. Not because I think that women should or must be
portrayed with some sort of softness, but because you are portrayed as a
kind of deciphering machine. Meticulous is the word that is used the most,
which makes me think of Mephisto somehow. In any case: Disembodied.
Without the body, I could have made it. Without its weakness, its tiredness.

1 Emmett Bennett had sent Adelaide Hahn a letter on 22 June 1961 to inquire about
details of Alice Koberʼs life for his entry about her in Notable American Women
1607­1950. She annotated his information by hand. To his sentence “It seems to me
that Mrs. Kober spoke German” she added “Yes. She had a strong accent in
English”(Bennett Correspondence, PASP).
2 Horace was her favourite poet (see unsigned letter—probably from Joseph Pearl
—to Katharina Kober after Alice’s death, 31 May 1950, Brooklyn College File:
“Fate has dealt both you and us a most cruel blow. But as Alice’s favorite poet
Horace says, ‘There must be a limit to grief for one so dear.’ Patience only will
lighten what may not be cured.”).
3 As Alice Kober’s CV in her Guggenheim application shows, she spent the
summer of 1939 in Europe: “1939 (summer) examination of archaeological
exhibits in European museums, in France, Germany, Austria, Greece and Italy;
examination of important sites in Greece and Italy: tour of Greece (under American
School of Classical Studies in Athens) and study of newest work of the American,
British, French and German schools.” In the work plan, also part of the application,
she refers to the journey like this: “Survey of archaeological sites; hasty
examination of Minoan inscriptions found at Thebes and Pylos. Further plans
interrupted by the war.“ (PASP, Boxes 56.6 and 56.7).
4 “I am a pessimist, as you have probably guessed. I prepare for the worst. Usually
I am pleasantly surprised” (AK to SJM, 26 June 1947, Ashmolean Museum).
“Nasty character, that’s me” (AK to SJM, 26 June 1947, Ashmolean Museum).

It is a Matter of Resoluteness:
Body
──
256
In my body there is space for yours. You don’t seem tall on the picture I
will be finding, and sure I am not tall. Your brilliance, no doubt, exceeds
mine by far. I don’t have your rigour. I don’t have your persistence. I am not
bound to solve one of mankind’s great mysteries. I am, today, almost fully
occupied with sitting up straight. I am not being coquettish, just longing for
a shell. I wouldn’t care to be the one who has to do the moving.
I think of you and wonder if you were missing a shell too, from time to
time. It’s hard to imagine, reading your articles and considering your workload. Isn’t discipline wooden planks suspended over nothingness? How did
you do it? I mean, how did you not stumble and fall? Is this why you held
on to the facts, to what can be checked and double checked, what is undoubtedly true? To keep you on track? Today, I am off track. I’m dying to
dangle my feet, but they, inconsolably, touch the library’s carpet firmly.

ALICE WAS THAT kind of girl that would play hours and hours on her
own. The only thing that made her come to me was being hungry or just
wanting to eat something. She liked apples cut into pieces. But she hated
cut apples when the apple had been peeled. She had this phase, that
must have been before school, when she was played at being a cat. But
because it was Alice, she was not playing at being a cat, she was a cat.
She wouldn’t use any words, she answered in purrs. Ferrie wasn’t too
fond of childishness of that kind. After a while he ignored her. She could
rub up against his leg for as long as she wanted, but he didn’t pet her,
didn’t pick her up, even though Alice was his princess. He’d buy her
dresses, so beautiful that I didn’t want her to wear them. So expensive,
so delicate. But he insisted. I don’t really know where he got the money
from or what he did to get them. Sometimes I thought, well, I don’t grow
out of things, I could do with something nice too. But that just didn’t interest him. She was his little doll. I started to worry that Alice would
think her father didn’t like her anymore. So I begged her to stop being a
cat, to stand up straight, to talk, to smile for Ferrie’s sake. But she looked
at me with this cat gaze. You know the way cats look: with their little triangular heads tilted, the way in which you have no idea whether they
understand what you are saying and just don’t care, or if they really
have no idea what you want from them. When Ferrie went off to work, I
put a little bowl of cream on the kitchen floor. I couldn’t let the child
starve, could I? She did it for so long, it must have been several days in a
row, not answering, not blinking, that I began to think she had suffered a
──
258
concussion or something or had gone deaf. Things happen faster than
one might think inside those little heads, and I took her to our neighbour who had been a doctor back home. Alice would climb up to the
fourth floor on all fours. She would lick the backs of her hands while
neatly sitting on the doormat. Mr. Cramer examined her, but she wouldn’t answer him with words either. He said that Alice was fine, but that
she was a cat now and the only advice he could give me was to adjust her
diet. At least once a week she needed to eat a mouse or bird or a rat. He
asked me if I had traps in the house and I said yes. He said: “Try to catch
them alive, cats like to play with their prey before they eat them.” This
was too much for my poor little Alice. She stood up with an awfully grim
look on her face and said: “You can’t be a doctor if you can’t tell the difference between a girl and a cat.”
Then she walked home with me and has remained my little girl ever
since.

“WHAT IS IT like,” asked Alice, interrupting a cicada solo.
“Trying to remember every single dream you have ever had while
ironing shirt after shirt?”
“Not that. That,” Alice raised her eyebrows and nodded slightly.
“What, I thought you weren’t interested in doing any of that clinging
nonsense? Or what was it that you called it…”
“I’m not interested in doing it. I just wondered what it feels like. It
seems so far-fetched and altogether degrading.”
“I’ll tell you if you kiss me.”
“Well, don’t tell me then. You are such a silly creature, Laurie.”
“No, seriously. I want to kiss you. And even more so, I want you to be
kissed. Have another one or two of these and you won’t find the idea
childish anymore.” Laurie poured two glasses of whiskey.
“I shouldn’t have asked,” said Alice, lighting a cigarette. “Tell me
more about ironing. That’s also a subject matter I have virtually no
knowledge of. How does it feel?”
“Maybe all of us should live with our mothers. She even does your
clothes? That is just not fair.”
“I guess she likes doing it. Or at least she is so used to doing it that
she doesn’t mind. The truth is, she can’t stand watching me doing anything in the house. I never paid attention to all the things she taught me.
In her world, she failed me.”
“It leaves an emptiness behind which cannot be filled.”
“Well, I’m not forcing her, you know.”
──
260
“Not your mother. That. First you tilt into one another, like sheets of
light in a cardboard box. You dissolve, but keep your outline, the edges.”
Alice emptied her glass tumbler, the sound of her evenly paced swallowing echoing back from the house wall.
“I don’t see how light can keep its edges while fading. And would that
be a good thing?” she asks.
“Yes,” Laurie said with a warmth in her voice that Alice had never
noticed before. “Yes, that is a good thing. But afterwards you are left
with all your emptiness, so endlessly hollow. And there’s nothing you
can do to fill yourself again, at least if you are lucky and they didn’t leave
their future inside.”
“That sounds terrible,” Alice said softly.
“It’s not terrible, it’s just that you know for a couple of days that you
consist of a lack at the core. I will never get used to that feeling. Once I
almost tried to stuff a towel inside me. But then I saw for the first time
that the little embroidered violets on the bordure have those tiny squinted faces, and that stopped me. I mean, you don’t shove little faces in
there if you are lucky enough to not to have one growing there already.
Right?”
Alice had no idea what to say. Didn’t Laurie want to feel something
growing inside her? Wasn’t that what women wanted? At least women
who go for the whole domestic thing, or are made to go for it. The image
of Ruby flashed through Alice’s head, the pregnant girl at the dance
marathon in McCoy’s crime novel everybody had liked so much.1
 How
Alice had all the time feared the scene in which she would fall onto her
stomach during one of the derbies and a lot of blood would be on her underside and all sorts of flesh that had been alive just minutes before. And
how even though that scene never came, thanks to the women of the
Moral League, who had Ruby removed from the marathon and tried to
shut down the sad circus of lost souls altogether, how even though Mc­
──
261
Coy resected Ruby from the text from one page to the next, how despite
all that, Ruby will always have buried her child with the weight of her
own body in Alice’s mind. As if Alice’s copy of the book had actually contained this horror that everyone else’s hadn’t. Ruby had been lying on
that ragged parquet floor, Alice had seen it in her own mind.
“Right?”
“No, I guess you wouldn’t,” said Alice, returning from that seedy
racetrack on a Hollywood pier where the Pacific pounded underneath to
her balcony chair with the Pacific crashing into the coast, several states
away, a distant and dark heart.
“I like my hollow,” said Alice, “but I am aware of it in a strictly theoretical way. I have never actually felt it, which is what makes all the difference, doesn’t it?”
“It does,” agreed Laurie, arranging her hair in a ponytail as neat and
tidy as the one before.
“Sometimes, when I try to learn something, like vocabulary, and just
can’t keep it in my head, I console myself over my already overflowing
brain with the idea that I could store some of the information in this unused space. Like a warm cellar or something.”
“You are also a silly creature, Alice Kober, let me tell you that. But I
guess it’s a good idea, just imagine how those thoughts would grow! I’d
like to be with you when they make you push them out and clean them
and wrap them in one of those blankets.”
There is a moment of silence, then a stifling giggle, and then a fit of
suppressed laughter which couldn’t be calmed down. Every word of reason came out as a laugh.

I think of your body like my Grandma’s body, the way I remember it. Of
course, I remember her when she was in her mid seventies, and you were in
your early forties. Your skin was smoother, your kidneys weren’t surrendering. You had another war, another loss inscribed in your bones, your flesh.
My grandmother’s body was slow and certain. It didn’t want to be attractive,
not in an aggressive gesture, but finite. It was a body in the wrong place,
knowing that its original place had ceased to exist. My grandmother’s body
was a site of abandonment which was never spoken of. Maybe it’s the curls
and the glasses and the grain of contempt in the eyes which makes me think
of her. Contempt for all that is wasted in life, one way or another.

***
ALICE WAS THE kind of child that never liked going to bed, apart
from at family parties. When we had my sister over with her children
and everything was loud and a mess, Alice would, after eating as much
cake or marillenknödel as we could give her, silently disappear. You’d
never see her leave; at some point you’d just notice that you hadn’t seen
her in a while. Her cousins were making jokes about Alice, but she didn’t
mind. She would put on her nightgown, brush her teeth, comb her hair
and curl up in bed, no matter what the time of day. I couldn’t get her
out, not for anything in the world. And a part of me didn’t want to get
her out: a part of me enjoyed that, for once, it was effortless to get her
into bed. From her youth, she just wasn’t tired. Not like other kids who
want to stay up to play or be with the adults but, in fact, are so exhausted that they finally fall asleep sitting at the table or tying their
shoelaces. No. Alice was wide awake. Later on, as a school girl, she would
lie down without making a fuss. When she was younger, bedtime was the
only thing that made her cry. She didn’t cry when she fell, she didn’t cry
when Willie hurt her in his clumsiness or rage, she didn’t cry when she
didn’t get what she wanted. When I went to bed, she was almost always
still awake. I’d ask her what she was doing and she said she was sleeping.
This was said completely truthfully. She thought that lying in bed and
being bored was actually what sleeping was. I don’t know what thoughts
went through her little head for all those hours. I don’t know how much
she slept, because I myself am a good sleeper. Ferrie was too. I don’t
know where she got it from. When she was six or seven and her teeth
──
264
started to fall out, she’d spend the nights wiggling them. She did it even
with teeth that weren’t quite loose, she’d just decide on which one was
next. She seemed to like the pain that came with it. Alice was the kind of
child you never really worried about, but you wondered a lot. Where did
all those ideas and habits come from? I still have no idea. Not from us,
most certainly, and not from other kids, because she didn’t like to be
with them. The only one she liked was a boy from the neighbourhood
who was a bit slow. She was very gentle with him and talked to him a lot.
When I asked her what they were talking about, she of course refused to
tell me.
──

IT WAS A perfect spot: slightly cooler air, and some shrubs smelling
of a tangy shade of green and a rock smoothly washed out by the millennia into the shape of a recliner. Alice went up there every night while
the others had their after-dinner drinks, smelling of fire inside and out.
She took a book with her, but never opened it. It was more a prop for the
others to not question her, let alone follow. Her muscles were so sore
from kneeling, bending and digging that her body felt like one of these
collapsing donkey toys, held together with hot wire instead of numb
elastic. There were so many stars up there, it looked almost like a mistake. Alice enjoyed drifting away a little, the wind still dry from the heat
covering her like a blanket. From time to time laughter from the camp or
shrieking voices, someone answering a coyote in the distance. It took a
while until the steps she heard really reached her, became a part of reality. Unstable steps, sliding, little rocks leaping off.
“I’m fine,” Alice said into the darkness. The steps stopped.
“Good, good,” said an exceptionally deep voice, giving away who was
climbing up the slope. “We were wondering if we could bring you to join
us? At least for the last evening?”
“Thanks, but I’m fine, really.” Alice didn’t get up, but placed the book in
her lap in a way that suggested she had just put it down. “I’ll be down
there in a minute.” Now Marcello stood in front of her, the legs of his
trousers covered in red dust.
“The moon is bright, but not that bright,” he said, pointing at her
book. “Why are you avoiding us?”
──
266
“I just don’t like groups, that’s all. Nothing personal. Besides, it’s so
calm up here, back in Brooklyn it will seem like a dream. I’m just taking
it in, storing it.” Marcello made a sound that could have meant anything.
Most probably he was mocking her, but Alice didn’t care. That chunky
ex-frat boy who was so used to being the centre of the world, he would
mock gravity if he could.
“What is it that you pretend to be reading?” he asked, kneeling down
next to Alice’s millennia old resort, balancing on the balls of his feet.
“The woman that wants to be left alone,” said Alice, turning the book
so that he couldn’t see the cover anymore.
“Chandler,” said Marcello. “Good, good.” He kept balancing, looking
over the canyon. With another inconclusive sound he sat down in the
dust, hugging his shins. “I hear you are a curious woman,” he said, glancing at Alice from the side. Her recliner momentarily turned into stone
and started to hurt her back. She wanted to get up, but she needed space
to manoeuvre herself out of her cavity.
“Curious and tired.”
“Come on, you can’t be that detached. Help this oafish mind out and
tell me about your work. You might be surprised to find that other
people care.”
“Really, this is neither the place nor the time for me telling you
about deciphering an ancient script. Plus, you probably know almost
everything already, as you are an archaeologist and I am not.”
“But I don’t know you,” Marcello said, “you odd pot. You kept hiding
from me the whole time. Deep in the ground.”
The thing with a really comfortable seating is that you are either
helped up by a friendly hand or roll yourself onto the side, gracelessly
breaking the spell of weight.
“Stay,” said Marcello, “please.” He moved his body in front of Alice’s
and brushed her hair out of her face with the back of his hands. Alice
──
267
was not so much in shock at him as she was at herself. Her skin welcomed him, her muscles betrayed her.
“Kiss me,” he said and moved away, making room for the canyon and
all the stars looking down on Alice. He stretched out his hand to help
Alice up. Her bones betrayed her, moving her hand towards his.
“No,” she said, now standing in front of him. “I don’t…” His fingertips
softly on her collar bones and the back of her neck, not pushing her, not
pulling her. Marcello stood perfectly silent, his eyes on Alice. At this moment and many years later too, when Alice revisited this scene in her
mind, she couldn’t find an explanation for why she did what she had
done: She had put her forehead on his sternum, bringing space between
the length of her body and his. And when he put his hands on her waist,
not pulling her, but ever so warm, she moved against him and she did
what he had asked. A part of herself, from afar, wanted to recoil from
him when his tongue touched hers, but the majority of Alice’s body
stayed right where it was, feeling what it felt. Just before Marcello tried
to unbutton her blouse she pushed him away, and produced a “No” that
sounded like one.
“Good, good,” Marcello said, “a respectable woman in the wilderness.” Alice started to run downhill, time and time again sliding. Little
rocks leaping away into their coverings. When she saw the campfire she
stopped to check her clothes. She wanted to close that one tell-tale button, but her hands were shaking so much that she couldn’t even feel the
hole. Alice sat down and waited in the dark until everybody had gone to
sleep, sneaking into the women’s tent enveloped in darkness. Now her
skin was sore too.
──
268
I haven’t seen my grandmother die. I haven’t seen you die. I’ve been sitting up straight.
It doesn’t make any difference, but I wonder if you really never knew
that you were terminally ill. That they didn’t even tell you the diagnosis.
That they opened your body and then saw that they were far too late. That
they closed your body and drew a line and let you believe you could return
to your work eventually, if you just balanced things well enough. It didn’t
seem impossible: Why worry the woman? Let her go in peace. Would you
have wanted to know? Would you have written more letters, last letters, instructions, provisions? Probably.
──
269
***
ALICE WAS THE kind of a young woman that was not particularly interested in household matters. “You aren’t teaching it to Willie so don’t
teach it to me, Muttchen.” She was so aware of how different her life was
going to be from mine. Sometimes she even said so: “You didn’t come to
the new world to make it like the old one, did you?”
“What do you know about the old world?” I would answer.
“Everything you’ve told me about it,” she would say, “remember?”
Even cooking didn’t pique her interest, no matter how much she liked
eating. She would fry herself a slice of bread or serve potatoes with
white cheese and flaxseed oil. But whatever took time to prepare frustrated her. Dicing. Peeling. She’d eat the potatoes unpeeled; said she didn’t mind. Ferrie wasn’t all that worried, I think he liked the idea of not
having her married to someone. Some man that could never be good
enough anyway. The only thing that she made me teach her was knitting. She was a furious knitter, I remember once she made a whole
sweater in just one night. We all wore her sweaters. When we had worn
them for a while she’d unravel them and make something else for
someone else from the yarn. She wasn’t attached to the garments that
echoed through our family. She just wanted to knit. Often she even read
while doing it2
. Like that, her hands and head were occupied. Willie was
quite the opposite. He loved spending the days somewhere outside,
minding his own boyish business. He knew all the kids that lived in our
street, he’d swap his treasures with them. He would just wander off.
Once, he hid in the store around the corner long enough to be locked in
──
270
when Mr. & Mrs. Mitts left for the day. He ate eleven bars of chocolate
before we found him. Alice didn’t talk to him for a couple of days. We
weren’t sure if it was because she thought we didn’t punish him in the
way he had deserved it, or if she was jealous of him eating the chocolate
without her. The two of them were so different that I had to remind myself from time to time that they had come from the same place. But the
curls were the same, as were the green eyes and the shape of their fingers and the little stomachs they had, even as kids.
──

“WHY DON’T YOU take a dip, too?” asked her mother, lying on her
belly. “Just to refresh,” she added, which seemed quite odd to Alice, given that her mother had never in her life swum in the sea or even considered doing so.
The sea3
, an incalculable multiple of the Danube, about which her
mother had been warned through her whole childhood. In a constant
hunger, the river must have swallowed girls and women, from time to
time a careless bachelor, a barge, a cow.
Alice knew these stories, like all stories from Prague back then, as the
supply was limited. Alice reached the end of her chapter, closed her book
and got up. She walked into the water without the slightest pause or hesitation so that the weighty cold could tear the breath out of her lungs.

When I write your name, I mistype it often.
The other day, when I was looking online for the one photograph of you
as an adult4
, the one that was taken for the article about the Guggenheim fellowships in 1946, I must have typed Korber instead of Kober. I found an
entry for a picture of Alice Korber in the Chaco Canyon Old Timers Reunion Oral History Project Photograph Collection5
, an archive that has never come up in my search before and wasn’t referenced in the Kober Papers. I
contacted them and only a couple of hours later they mailed me back. It
seems that only when my search is flawed do I actually end up finding
something.

And there, without any warning, you are looking at me.
Even though all five of you are standing next to each other, you are
clearly in front.
I wonder if the photographer had planned to arrange all five of you in
between the ropes, but you came late and didn’t fill the gap that was left for
you between Delphine and Pauline, you just stood where you stopped walking. In your right hand a cigarette, in your left hand a little pouch—maybe
the cigarettes, maybe something else. I try to zoom into the picture, but the
closer I look the blurrier it gets. Do you also hold your folded glasses in the
hand with the pouch? And if you have taken your glasses off, was it vanity?
Habit? Obligation?
Or did you want to refuse to be in the picture because you knew that you
wouldn’t like how the metallic silver would catch your body, your face from
the light and keep hold of it? And then the others wouldn’t stop asking you
to join them, either for emotional reasons or for the sake of documentary
completeness? Or was it to get it over with quickly, to avoid any further attention, and so you caved?
──
276
For a very long time I had doubts about the assumption that you were a
smoker, because I just couldn’t picture you writing or cutting or noting, so
concentrated and neat, while having to take care of fire, of ashes, of need.
When I learned that the idea of you as a chain smoker was based on the
sheer existence of the cigarette box filing system, I was sure that you had
gotten them from William or a neighbour or a colleague. Also, your former
student Eva Brann doesn’t remember you smoking in school6
. But then you
stood there, under the desert sun, ready for the next drag. (Later, when I reread the correspondence from the Brooklyn College file, I had even more
proof: you wrote to Professor Pearl that you brought your own cigarette supplies with you to England.7
)
You are 29 years old, and your lips are tightly closed. You are 29 years
old, and your arms don’t drag your shoulders, your upper body into obedience’s collapse like Helen’s, Delphine’s and Virginia’s. You are 29 years old,
and your hands are full.
──
277
The shadow’s length indicates a lunch break: either you are eager to eat
or eager to get back to work. I can’t stop looking at Pauline looking at you. I
know, from a letter from Pauline that I read in the archive, that you were
friends8
. I suppose you met there, at the summer excavations at Chaco
Canyon9
, and most probably you were already friends when this picture was
taken. Her arms are soft, but she stands up straight like a letter press type. If
I see this look of hers in the eyes of long­time lovers I get envious: knowing
each other, without illusions, and still being full of admiration for the other,
treating them with casual gratefulness like a basket of perfectly ripe
peaches, it’s too much for me to take. In your case, I am pleased that you
were looked at with such tenderness by the most graceful woman around.
Looking down but looking up. Ready to follow you in the shadow to light a
new cigarette with the one burning, hands fleetingly touching.
You are filled with the type of strength that usually can be seen in bus
drivers, night nurses, butchers’ wives on market day.
──
278
I admire your solidity, as if your body weren’t covered by those ridiculous trousers. Probably you weren’t vain, or at least you weren’t when, back
home in New York, you bought or borrowed the outfit you were advised to
pack. It seemed the right choice at the time. The shop in a basement, I imagine, was tiny even though they sold uniforms of all sorts. The owner—you
couldn’t quite decide if it was a man (following his features) or a woman
(according to her voice)—managed to find the right pair and the right size
without getting up from the chair. He or she held the trousers in the air for
you, and you had to walk up to him so you could see if they’d fit.
“Can do anything in them,” she said, “itchy but sturdy” and handed you
a sheet of paper to wrap them in. Even though you had never been treated
like this in a shop in your life, you weren’t outraged or uncomfortable, but
as warm as a fledgling in the hollow of two hands.

It is a matter of resoluteness, this slide of matter to your edge of the picture, even the tent giving willingly in.

***
ALICE IS SITTING on a cross between an easy chair and a chair: a
clumsy incommodiousness without any trace of cushioning. Alice is
turned to the side, her gaze the beginning of a sentence. The photographer kneels down, his joints crack, he positions his upper body in a
diagonal. He doesn’t say anything.
He feels embarrassed for telling Alice to hold a book in her lap, open,
and a pen in her hand. He’s embarrassed because he knows that they’ll
crop the image for the newspaper. Only her head will be in the article
listing the 1946 Guggenheim fellows.
He’s embarrassed because the hand which holds the pen is clearly the
most authentic part of the image. Authentic and truthful. The fingers
rest on the page, absolutely consistent with gravity and other laws of
nature. They touch the paper casually and naturally as if they belonged
to another person, in another life, in another time. The diaphragm opens
and closes with a dry rigour for which the photographer also would like
to apologize, if only he knew how.

1 Alice Kober liked reading detective novels, as the following passages from her
letters show, but she never mentioned which ones she read. I researched those
which were the most popular detective novels of her time (the 30s and 40s) and
read some of them, hoping that she might have read them as well. The book quoted
in the text is “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They” by Horace McCoy (first published
in 1935).
“As usual on a sea­trip, I caught up on detective stories, and saw a movie every
day” (AK to Joseph Pearl, 17 March 1947, Brooklyn College File).
“I’ve just spent a couple of hours reading a detective story. I was so tired after
finishing the article, I couldn’t think straight” (AK to FD, 18 October 1947, PASP,
Box 57).
“I don't like the idea of getting paid. If I wanted to make money writing, I’d write
detective stories” (AK to FD, 18 February 1948, PASP, Box 57).
2 “I can’t say back to my knitting—because I only knit when I read detective
stories, and therefore that’s in the field of entertainment” (AK to FD, 6 December
1947, PASP, Box 57).
3 “Otherwise no news. Some friends took me to the beach last week, both Mother
and I got terrific sunburns. We weren’t very careful, because neither of us usually
gets an effect from the sun; we hardly ever tan. This time, however, the sun seems
to have had more than the usual amount of actinic rays, or whatever it is that causes
sunburns.” (AK to SJM, 29 July 1947, Ashmolean Museum, Myres
Correspondence).
4 “Ich möchte Ihnen gerne ein Bild von mir schicken, habe aber keins. Sobald ich
eins bekomme, werde ich es in einem Brief schicken. Das letzte war die Passport
Photographie und die passt mir gar nicht” (AK to JS, 1 January 1948, PASP, Box
58).
(“I’d like to send you a picture of myself, but I don’t have one. As soon as I’ll have
one made, I’ll post it to you. The last one was the passport photography and I don’t
like it at all.”).
“Hier ist beiliegend ein Bild von ihr [Alice]. Wir mussten es von einer Gruppe
machen lassen, da wir in letzter Zeit kein Bild von ihr hatten” (Katharina Kober to
JS, 19 October 1950, PASP, Box 58).
(“Please find enclosed a photography of her [Alice]. We had to have it reproduced
from a group [shot?], as we didn’t have a newer picture of her.”).

6 “She was a chain­smoker (not in class, to my recollection, though I don’t think
there was a ban on indoor smoking)”, Eva Brann “In Memoriam Alice E. Kober”,
PASP, Box 58.1.
7 “Conditions in England remind me of our war years. Signs on store windows
‘Sorry no cigarettes’ (I brought my own, and helped pay part of Britain’s debt with
the duty), no electricity in the streets (it looks like Brooklyn at night, only damper),
everything is rationed.” (AK to Joseph Pearl, 17 March 1947, Brooklyn College
File).
8 There’s one letter from Pauline Vonnegut in Box 58, folder “assorted received
1941­1950” at PASP: “Dear Alice. The mad rush of finishing the old semester and
beginning a new one is over. I’m still alive and kicking. To you perhaps who are
waiting for information, I have probably gone down the drain. The point is I have
not located answers for each of your questions. The reference books in the libraries
to not have much to say about pants around the seashore.” (Letter from Pauline
Vonnegut to Alice Kober, 23 February 1941, PASP, Box 58).
9 The photograph is incorrectly dated, as Alice Kober’s CV, submitted to the
Guggenheim Foundation (PASP, Box 56.6), shows:
“work in archaeology. 1936 (summer) field work, excavating at Chaco Canyon,
New Mexico (under the University of New Mexico)”.

The Question of Getting you Here:
Franklin Daniel II
──
287
***
IT SAT RIGHT there, in the cheap straw purse she had bought from
that woman in front of the diner. Her eyes so cloudy, she must have been
almost blind.
“Usually my niece decorates them with sea shells,” she had said with
tender anger, addressing the sky turning into marzipan yellow more
than Alice, “but with summer this high, she’s off all over the village with
those friends of hers. God bless her, my rueful gull, may he bless you too
and all his lavender fields.” Alice nodded.
“It’s also beautiful when it is plain,” she said, the words feeling almost like an insult. It sat right there, in the bast purse on the mahogany
painted counter.
“What can I get you, ma’am?” asked the bartender who must have
only recently been expelled from the moon: he looked somewhat dusty,
his white hair and his body strangely compressed. Alice slid the little
purse towards her and put both her hands on it, a position that made her
think a little of church. She had no idea what she could possibly want, as
if she had never been to a bar before. Do people order coffee in bars?
Didn’t the man on the moon have some sort of mythical function, like
turning it on at night and off in the morning? How could the moon stay
up without its man? Will the Moon Man miss the craters he left behind?
Or had he been dying to go back to earth after all those years of duty,
pulling the earth, the seas, the days towards him as far as he could with
silvery strings?
──
288
“Did you find something?” The Moon Man was gesturing towards the
menu that he must have placed next to the purse.
“Do you serve coffee?” asked Alice.
“Unfortunately, we don’t,” reported the Moon Man, turning around
to the bottles and mirrors as if to check if a coffee maker had suddenly
appeared there without his knowledge. “You can get one in the lobby,
I’m sure.”
“I’ll meet my friends here.”
“I could go and order coffee for you?”
“To be honest, I don’t really want coffee. I just want to be alone for a
moment.”
The Moon Man nodded, his face turning a shade lighter. He dried his
already dry and slightly blotchy hands on the white tea towel which
dangled from the chain he wore around his hips. The letter was right
there, Alice saw the envelope’s edge. Then she rested her forehead on
the back of her hands, now spread out on the bar. Franklin was alive. It
was his handwriting, no doubt. Franklin was home. Franklin was safe.
Suddenly, it felt silly that Alice never had dared to ask any of his colleagues that she had met at the Christmas Meetings where he was, how
he was. It was a thing a man could do without even so much as thinking
about it: “How’s Daniel holdin’ up over there? Lots of red wine, I suppose? Those lucky bastards in Greece, while the rest of the boys are
fighting for their lives in the French trenches. Listen to that: French
trench. Sounds like living hell to me.”
It just wasn’t a thing a woman could do. Another thing that wasn’t a
thing a woman could do was write to Mrs. Daniel to ask about her husband’s whereabouts and health. What if he had died? What if he hadn’t?
A woman scholar could, at best, find the reprint of an article on her desk
after the summer holidays and inquire, after two years of silence, as to
where she could send it. But if there’s no answer to that, all that a wo­
──
289
man could do was to wait, eventually open this letter and receive the
news. A woman could only use whatever hollow was in herself as a letter
box, happily pulling up the little assiduous flag. Maybe this was why they
sent the men overseas—not because of their physical strength, but of the
women’s. Women didn’t have to be trained, they were already experts in
the matter of lacking. And longing. Dealing with shortages, doing
without. Alice felt her breath speeding, creeping up her throat. It was at
that mediocre hotel bar in Boulder, Colorado that Alice realised that all
her hollows had been filled up with incertitude, hope and composure
over the last few years. The tears her body produced were tears of anger.
It was like walking with a heavy bag for a mile or two, finally putting it
down and remembering how light your own body used to feel, so light
that it almost hurts.
When the Moon Man put a glass of water in front of her and then
circled around his bar to come and stand on her side, a little less compressed, Alice wasn’t able to bring the words in her head into any order.
She didn’t know if she was empty or full. She didn’t want to know. Wasn’t this something a woman could do? Not want to know? The Moon Man
shrugged gently, probably a woman could not want to know, there was
nothing about it that seemed wrong or indecent to him. But he was a
man whose expertise was filling glasses with colourful liquids, what did
he know about women and men?
“Witnessing their conversations and lonelinesses doesn’t mean understanding anything,” he said, shaking a cigarette out of a pack. Alice
remembered that she had walked on greasy grey tiles, smelling the acrid
warmth of excessive dishwashing. She was leaning next to the back door,
holding a cigarette in her right hand and the Moon Man’s white tea towel in her left.
“You will be fine,” said the Moon Man while Alice sobbed, “or you
won’t, what do I know? I don’t know you, but I know. I mean in general. I
──
290
can tell who is lost. Shut up, Trevor,” the Moon Man said to himself,
“just let the lady get some air.”
“I never cried during the war. Not once. Maybe I should have. But I
didn’t need to. Isn’t that peculiar?”
“It isn’t a good place for bad news,” the Moon Man said and pointed
off into the sky, “being away from home.”
“That’s not it at all. In fact, this is the best news I’ve had in a very,
very long time.”
“Then I want my smoke back,” said Trevor, opening the pack in front
of Alice. “I thought someone had died. Can’t give out perks to the privileged happy.” For a second Alice considered obeying his gesture, then
she realised he was joking.
“I’m sorry,” she said, “I made a scene. That’s not very much like me.”
“We don’t always have to be ourselves,” Trevor said, “that’s what I
have learned standing behind the bar all these years. In fact, I think we
rarely are.”
“You are always the bartender.”
“I could also be a ballet dancer.” He pirouetted slowly and terribly
lopsidedly. It was impossible to tell if he really was a ballet dancer—or,
for that matter, had been one when he was younger, or if he was making
a joke. “See?” He took her hand, asking her for a dance.
“I seem to have a hard time knowing myself. Maybe a gin & tonic
would help?”
“With pleasure,” said Trevor and put his cigarette out. He held the
door for Alice: this time she saw the tiny kitchen and the two very old
women standing in a corner, drying glasses with gestures so assertive
that the hollow-ware seemed like a camouflage for their actual duty,
which was nothing less than spinning the world.

ALICE WAS RESTING on a bed in Boulder, Colorado. Albany Hotel: 100
rooms, 90 with bath. The plaid was made from peach-coloured fabric
squares which were colder than expected. Alice looked at the letter
which had been waiting for her in the little box with her room number
on it, 79. As she didn’t have her letter opener with her, she had opened it
with her nail file.
She tapped her ballpoint pen on the note pad she found in the drawer, right under the Bible. There were steps in the adjacent room, then
words. Laurie and Helen discussing the next leg of the journey: Santa Fe
or Salt Lake City?1
 Alice was happy to leave decisions like this—not making a real difference to the course of things—to others.
Alice breathed in. Then she pushed the sore parts of her toes against
the fabric. The lack of skin turned into embers. Alice breathed out.
“Tell your wife I am grateful to her for keeping you where I can write
you about my findings once in a while.” This is what she had written him
four years ago. Then, silence.
Another dependency, another absence, another nature of nature.
Alice wanted to get up to comb her hair, but she forced herself to
keep resting, on her back and look at the poorly-painted ceiling, winterblue.
“How that must feel, to come home after four years?” asked Alice
Laurie, who was standing in the door between the rooms.
“How it must feel to be deprived of a home for four years,” said
Laurie. And: “Mexico?”
──

“Why not?” said Alice and put the pen into the little gap between the
mattress and the wall. What on earth can one write if everything has to
be said?

7 July 1946 –––––––––––PASP
Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
Dear Alice,
Your letter of Sept. 25, 1944, asking for my whereabouts was waiting for
me when I returned from my then whereabouts a few days ago. The purpose
of the query, in case you have forgotten, was to learn whether it was safe to
send me an offprint. It is safe now, and one would be welcome if there are
any left.
I have had quite a time of it, four years in the army, 40 months overseas,
entirely in Greece and the Middle East, and no leave at all. Now I am reaping my reward in the form of the maximum permissible terminal leave, carrying me into October. While I still feel more or less on vacation, I am going
in to my office at the museum a couple of times a week, and am in the process of taking over the AJA.
Part of the “backlog” which I found waiting for me in the AJA is your
“Inflection in Linear Class B: 1­Declension”. It has already been edited by
Miss Swindler (no changes that I can spot) and is ready for press. All that
we need now is a press. Literally, the “June” number of the Journal was
waiting for me ready, once we can find a press to print it, so that I won’t be
able to put your article into it. I will, however, put it in just as soon as possible afterwards, and hope to have it in circulation late this year.
One of my reasons for behaving so well and trying to rush your article
in to print (another reason is that I like it) is that I want to gain your confidence so that you will continue to give us your articles. I really consider
them very valuable, and will be glad to publish anything of the type that you
have to give us.

“GIVE ME THAT pen, you should go to sleep.”
“I’ll just finish this line.”
“That’s what you said half an hour ago.”
“It’s a long letter.”
“He doesn’t deserve so much of your time.”
“That would be my decision.”
“But I remember how heartbroken you were when he didn’t write
back.”
“He was in the army. And I wasn’t heartbroken.”
Helen scoffed and got out of bed. She put on her dressing gown and
sat down in the leather chair right next to Alice.
“You should use your energy on the living. The living attentive
ones.”
“Franklin is alive. And stop talking up that bartender, he was friendly
for professional reasons.”
Helen lit a cigarette and followed the smoke with her eyes.
“He could have written you, you know, even in Greece they have
mail, as far as I’ve heard. I think they installed it shortly after they invented how to write. He could have let you know that he is alright.”
Alice shrugged. She didn’t want to admit that Helen was right, because she knew where that would lead to—admitting that she was always
right, with everything. Helen believed in the existence of an easy solution for any situation. She didn’t acknowledge complexities in her life
and indeed it seemed free of them, which made it impossible to make her
──
295
understand that other people’s lives followed different rules, other levels
of uncertainty. She wouldn’t believe that malaises weren’t created by a
wandering mind. Sometimes, Alice thought Helen could have, in a prior
life, been that Austrian princess or queen who exclaimed, after having
been told that their people were so poor that they didn’t have enough
bread to eat: But why don’t they eat cake then? But, on the other hand, it
was highly unlikely that an actual person would have been shallowminded enough to have thought like that and probably it was just a legend to vilify that queen or princess, a woman, in any case. Some problems just don’t have easy solutions which precisely is what makes them
intriguing. And some problems aren’t even problems. They are just life.
Maybe he hadn’t known for how long he would be gone for. Maybe he
wasn’t allowed to write to anyone other than his close family. Maybe he
couldn’t find the right words, away from his university desk and official
stationary.
“You don’t need the pen to stare at the paper,” said Helen, and attempted to snatch it. In an unexpectedly expansive reflex movement,
Alice took her hand away and almost hit Helen, knocking the cigarette
out of her hand. It circled itself in an ember aureola and ever so slowly
danced to the floor, where the yellow red seeped into the carpet, revealing a resting heart. It was an instant of awkward yet absolute beauty.
Alice jumped to her feet.
“Jesus,” snapped Helen and picked up the cigarette, stepping on the
carpet with her slippers. When she took her foot away, there was a little
black hole.
“We can move the chair over here and nobody will see,” was Helen’s
suggestion.
“I’m quite sure that, at some point, they’ll move the chair to clean
the room.”
“They won’t be able to prove that it was us.”
──
296
“It’s such a shame you didn’t study law. But then the whole thing
wouldn’t have happened in the first place, because then you knew that
stealing is an offence.”
“The end justifies the means.” Helen smiled and one moment later
she had Alice’s pen in her hand. “Go to sleep now, tomorrow you’ll get it
back.”

Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
Dear Franklin
Your letter reached me here to­day. My family sent it on because of the
Lt­Colonel, I think. My brother is running a laboratory for the Signal
Corps, and I gather he respects your title.
I’m taking a long vacation with some friends—we’re driving west and
then to Mexico.
When I go back, I’ll really tackle Minoan. Thanks to the Guggenheim
Foundation, I’ll have a whole year to work. Just now I’m analyzing Carian,
I brought the material along, and work on it at odd intervals.
This letter is running on at great length. I’m so delighted that you are
about to enter civilian life again, that I hate to stop.

***
WHEN THE CONCIERGE handed Alice a folded paper after the checkout was settled, she felt like a school girl caught cheating or having not
done the homework, both of which had never happened to her in reality
but many times in her dreams. Why did she go along with Helen’s coverup? Just because it seemed like a very expensive thing to replace a hotel
room’s carpet? To prove that the easy solution is always going to be
blown? With unease and satisfaction, Alice unfolded what she expected
to be a bill or some sort of accusation. It was a white sheet of paper
which loosely enclosed a newspaper clipping of very poor quality: Two
ballet dancers on stage. She looked at the concierge to get some sort of
explanation, but he was busy with filing papers. The print was done with
too much contrast, the black faded over time, approximating the paper’s
sandy colour. The paper was thin and smooth, not like any newspaper
Alice knew. She turned the cutout around—cyrillic letters. Laurie called
her, they were waiting in the car outside. Alice waved to the concierge,
who in turn took a subtle bow. It took her almost twenty miles sitting on
the backseat and feeling the warm wind dishevelling her hair to connect
the dots: It must be a message from the bartender. A message without
words, without a message in fact. One of the taut apparitions could be
him in his younger years, but it could also be pretty much anybody else.
But why would he keep an old newspaper clipping of somebody other
than him? And if it was him, why would he give this memento of an early
life of precision and fame away? Why to her? She checked the paper several times for hints, for something illuminating added by his hand. It felt
──
299
like the opening to a novel. It took Alice another ten miles to decide that
none of this was her business. The bartender had been right and maybe
was making this point again: We don’t have to be ourselves all the time.
If he could be a dancer, what could Alice be? She could be jaunty, like
Laurie and Helen and so many others wanted her to be. She could, indeed, not finish the second letter to Franklin she had already begun to
write in her head. She could be a vacation person and at night she could
study Carian as she had planned to. She could be invincible, she could be
a ghost in any newspaper in the world. Alice folded the cryptic relic
three times and slid it into her pocket. She would use it as a reminder to
be herself by not being herself, and then leave it in the last hotel room of
the summer—in the back of the desk’s drawer, behind her bed’s headboard, inside an abundant lamp shade. Maybe the next person to come
across it would be curious enough to find out if it really was Trevor, if
Trevor was his name, if he had been famous, if a horrible accident during
rehearsals had brought his career to an untimely end, if he was ever to
see the moon again in his life.

8 September 1947 ––––––PASP
Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
Your idea about excavating Sardis sounds wonderful—if it can be done.
I don’t know of any better site. As a matter of fact, I don’t really know much
about sites—from the practicing archaeologists’ point of view. But imagine
how wonderful it would be if a few bilinguals of assorted varieties turned
up. I hope, though, that they aren’t Semitic. Semitic and Egyptian are a nuisance, because they lack vowel signs, and leave too much to the imagination.
I doubt that I’ll ever learn to read vowelless Semitic—and so anything later
than Akkadian (Assyrian) drives me to drink.
I meant to end the letter here. But I just remembered something. Sundwall in his last letter to me asked if something could be done about establishing a sort of “Minoan Institute” here in the U.S., where the literature,
reproductions, etc. could be collected. He thinks Europe isn’t safe.
──
302
11 September 1947 –––––PASP
Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
Sundwall’s idea about a “Minoan Institute” is provocative. Do you think
he refers simply to epigraphical and linguistic material, or to all archaeological material in general? In either case it would be a fairly big order and I
wonder whether Myres, the Italians, and the Greeks would cooperate to the
extent of supplying us with casts or their inscriptions. I didn’t mention Blegen in the above list because I am very much afraid that he intends to sit on
his material for a good many years and give no one else a chance to get at
it.
I would certainly strongly support such a project. The chief trouble, to
that, of course, is that you are the person in this country who is working
most actively in the material and it should really be in a place which is easily accessible to you.
──
303
18 September 1947 –––––PASP
Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
I’ll write to Sundwall that his idea about a “Minoan Institute”sounds
interesting, and that I’ve mentioned it to you.
I do want to have a hand in its establishment—if it can be arranged. In
many ways Philadelphia is an ideal place. It is close enough to New York,
yet far enough away in case we ever are bombed (which I doubt for the
present, but may happen). An “Institute” is really a combination of Museum
and University.
Since the beginnings would be small, I should be “available” for assistance, at any rate week­ends and summers, if personal presence is necessary. You don’t mean full time, do you? I have a job which, while far from
ideal in many ways (for instance, when I need to go to Greece) does pay
well. I don’t intend to keep it all my life, but at present the kind of work I’d
really like is open only to men. If you were thinking of somebody who would
devote full time to it (always with all the ifs) how about Sundwall himself?
He wrote me in his first letter that he is retiring (he’ll be seventy this fall).
He seems to be hale and hearty.
But count on me for everything that I can do, in the way of letters, influence, personal assistance, etc. etc. I think the Europeans would co­operate,
once it has been started; they probably all feel as Sundwall does, that there
should be a place in America where the things will be safer. Besides, it’s
about time Europeans were coming to America to study, as we go to
Europe. Maybe even Blegen will cooperate, once the “Institute” is a fait accompli.
I do hate to think of its going to Cincinnati though.

Can’t think of anything I’d like better than being in charge of it myself,
with you as boss. You’re one of the few people I know who’s willing to try
something that sounds like a good idea, without insisting on a list of precedents first.
Well, there are still a lot of ifs in the situation.

19 September 1947 –––––PASP
Franklin Daniel to Alice Kober
I have just had a few words with our Director, who is in favor of the
Minoan Institute idea. My understanding is that at first at least our effort
would be directed toward getting plaster impressions.
The second question, that of getting you here, is more complicated and I
am not sure that I see the solution though I have an idea. The idea is simply
that Roland Kent has retired as Professor of Indo­European Philology and
his chair has not been filled. I don’t know whether they intend to fill it or
not, but I will try to find out about it. It might be that I could start a minor
boom with hopes of success in having the position made available to you. In
case it were, I would like to urge that the appointment be partly in the University and partly in the Museum, specifically for the Minoan business. I
gather that the major emphasis in such a combination would have to be on
the University. Kent’s heaviest teaching load was in Greek and Latin linguistics, particularly the latter. I have no doubt that you can handle this
with the greatest of ease. As you understand, I’m thinking out loud; my
thoughts are iffy and my putting them down on paper is nothing short of
rash. I am putting this out simply as a feeler so as to know your reaction to
the whole thing. Obviously I would not want to push the matter without feeling reasonable sure that you would be interested if it succeeded. Don’t count
on it too much because I am still pretty young in university politics and it
may well be that my word will carry even less weight than I timidly think.
Furthermore I am afraid that there is something of a prejudice against giving faculty appointments to women. How strong it is I don’t know, but will
soon find out.

Dangling Professor Kent’s shoes and the Institute in front of my nose
like that, when all I’m teaching this term is Greek and Roman literature in
Translation, and high­school level Vergil, is almost more than I can bear. I
daren’t say no, and I daren’t say yes. I’m getting a big salary for a woman
teacher, I don’t know exactly what it is right now, what with cost of living
bonusses and a revision in increments because of a law­suit with which I
had nothing to do, but which benefits me. I know it’s over 6,000, but can’t
say how much more, and if I get a promotion (which is overdue) mandatory
annual increments will bring it up to $7,000 or thereabouts eventually. Then
there’s tenure, and a pension that depends on staying in the city system. I
know enough about academic salaries for women to realize that financially
I can’t do better, at least for another ten years.

There should be no difficulty about setting up the Minoan collection as
such, though, of course, it would be rather lost without someone like you to
look after it and use it. If you were to come here, you would have to teach
general Indo­European linguistics (ancient) as well as some work in Latin
philology and probably Greek dialects. I assume that none of this would
hold any terrors for you. Have you published anything in the general Indo­European field to which I could refer people here? It might help. I have
had some success in softening up the classicist and orientalists on the matter and am about ready to make a frontal attack on the Dean. I certainly
hope that this works out. It would give us a wonderful nucleus here for Aegean and Near East studies generally and would tie in admirably with our
plans for Sardis.

I haven’t said anything about your project to lure the University authorities into luring me from Brooklyn, because I thought I would let the gods
decide the matter. When I say it’s the kind of thing I hoped to get when I was
around sixty, you can see why I say nothing and lay low.
I haven’t published anything on general IE because I didn’t have anything worthwhile to say, and publishing an article a year on Minoan has
kept me busy. I have a fairly sound general background, which includes
about four years of Sanskrit with Edgerton in Yale, some Tocharian with
Lane of North Carolina, Old Irish with Dillon of Chicago, Old Persian (a
smattering—I was too busy learning six other languages at the same time)
with Kent, Hittite with Sturtevant and Goetze, and assorted non­Indo­European languages ranging from Sumerian to Basque & Chinese. I
have enough self­confidence to feel I can teach anything classical. I think
I’m a good teacher, at least my students come to class with a smile, laugh at
my jokes, learn what I want them to, and I enjoy it tremendously.

My nefarious schemes re you and the University are coming along
slowly, but not unsatisfactorily. I would say that you are definitely considered a possibility for the job; the next step is to make you seem the only
possibility. I certainly think that it would be wonderful, for us at least, if this
thing could be pulled off. It is just what we need to make this into a first
class center for the study of the Bronze Age in Greece and the Near East.

Is Hönigswald the other person you mentioned? He’s a good man, and
deserves a break. I was glad to find that out, because it gives me an idea of
the sort of person being considered. I think I’m as well prepared as he in
linguistics, though it might be hard to prove without a direct trial, because
he has been teaching all kinds of things in various places, while I’ve been
plugging along at my own uninspiring job.
 The trouble is, I never expected to take another job, and have made absolutely no effort to learn or publish things that might impress anyone.
People don’t ordinarily leave the city college once they are set, because the
salaries are good, and there is the question of pension. As things are now, I
can retire at 55, and have every intention of doing so, and perhaps taking
some more congenial teaching work then.
There are other factors involved: the question of more congenial teaching, working with the Minoan material, and working with you. I figure they
might be worth the sacrifice—but I wouldn’t be heart­broken in either case.
And I can still help with the Minoan Research Library in any event.
I am quite neutral about the whole thing. I won’t refuse the job if it is
offered, but I don’t want it so badly that it’s worth too much effort.

Everybody tells me this job, if it materializes, would be a wonderful opportunity. I know that too. It’s too good to be true.
All the same, I’ve been figuring out what I would do if the job actually
materializes. I think I would work it this way: I’d take it, and try to get a
year’s leave without pay from Brooklyn College. In that way, I can find out
how it really works out, and if I’m not as good as I think I am, can retire
gracefully at the end of the year, to everybody’s relief, and come back here.
If it works out, I can resign here.
I own a house here in Flatbush, and think I’ll hold on to it, coming home
week­ends, so that Mother won’t be completely alone, at least for the first
year. I presume the housing situation is as bad in Philadelphia as in New
York.
I’ve never told you I’m grateful for all you’re doing. I am. It’s been fun,
too.

Just a word to tell you the latest since the meeting of the Classics department yesterday. First and most important, I left it feeling most encouraged. The two chief candidates are you and a man (not Hönigswald, at least
not at the moment) whom no one here knows personally, but who has written one or two things that Crosby does not understand but finds impressive.
What I may not have made clear before is that the committee on the IE
appointment was very strongly impressed by the Minoan research library
project. Everybody made it very clear that they would be delighted to have
this established here. One person went so far to say that although he was
not convinced by the information presented that you were the proper person
for the IE post, he would still look with great favor in your appointment
here in some other capacity. If we can convince him that you are qualified to
teach IE (and I think we can), then I feel that your chances are excellent; I
might almost go so far as to say that it would be in the bag.

Your latest letter has me sitting here with my tongue hanging out, and
that’s bad. I’m trying to preserve my equilibrium, so that I’ll be happy no
matter how things turn out. You’re heartless.
I’ve resolutely refused to think how wonderful it would be to have
people like Speiser and Kramer right there in case Minoan starts swiveling
toward Semitic, Hurrian, Sumerian, etc., and an Egyptologist on tap so I
can finally get to read it.
Now you add a course in Minoan scripts!!! I’ve been looking at the list
of course, and feel much encouraged. I could begin teaching most of them
to­morrow, and plan the entire course in a week or two.
If you can do half as well in selling me to Pennsylvania as you have
done in selling Pennsylvania to me—it’s in the bag.

One trouble is, we don’t know who the other candidates are. For instance, I can’t compete with a man like Sturtevant, but I couldn’t figure out
what younger person could be superior.
Don’t you think a lot of the opposition is really based on the fact that
I’m a woman? Even if it isn’t openly mentioned.

The fact that you are a woman has absolutely nothing to do with the

Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
I’ve been meaning to write you ever since New Year’s, but didn’t get to
it, first because of the end­of­the­semester rush, then papers, and then I got
myself involved in a statistical study that may give immediate results, and
tore myself away from it only with the greatest difficulty.
I did try to see you the last morning of the meeting, and saw you at least
five times, but each time you were in deep conversation, and didn’t see me. I
didn’t want to interrupt. The last time you were just saying to someone
“Let’s go upstairs where we can talk without interference.” I saw you go up,
and decided I’d go home, because I still wasn’t feeling right. Something I
ate, no doubt.
──

Whenever I read this letter, it makes me shiver. Before christmas, Franklin was exchanging letters with you at a dizzying pace to get you to Penn,
but when you two have the chance to talk to each other because you are in
the same conference room, listening to people present their papers, he doesn’t even turn to you. He doesn’t pick up on your gaze which usually happens
if one looks at people with some sort of expectation. So when he doesn’t (or
doesn’t want to) talk to you, you don’t know if it’s because of the job or for
some other reason, I just wonder how he could be so close in his letters and
so cold in person. I can’t help but think that he was trying to get you to Penn
not for your sake, but for his—getting the nation’s best researcher in one of
the more exciting problems of archaeology. Is that it? He wants you to solve
it as a member of staff of his museum, to unlock new funds, to drizzle
prestige?
Or was he suffering from the confusion that occurs when a person that is
for weeks or months merely a voice or typed message suddenly materialises
and takes up too much space, almost all the space available outside one’s
own head? The stale disappointment caused by the very fact that this person
really exists and has a way of walking—touching a handrail in a funny way,
not really holding, but also not not holding—, a way of clearing her throat—
as if preparing to say something but remaining silent every single time—, or
the habit of carrying a bag loaded with books around, not putting it somewhere off to the side, but always in the middle where people have to step
over it, risking spilling their coffee.
Or couldn’t he make out who he was, having turned from the interspace
between ink ribbon and paper into spine and hair and suit? Did the words
fray in his mouth, words he’d used so often in writing to you that he had forgotten their taste?

ALICE STABILISED HERSELF by pressing her hands against the padded
tablecloth.
“Let me have a look for you, ma’am,” said the girl tending to the refreshments, a young girl with frighteningly old eyes.
“Thanks,” said Alice in the almost snowy voice one has when speaking while sucking in air. The cups were stacked quite elaborately, all
equipped with sugar and spoon and biscuit. Alice tried to focus on the
china’s pattern, to keep her mind from the unforgiving sensation that
someone was tying hot knots around her stomach. Alice was unable to
straighten her back. She heard the girl’s voice somewhere in the kitchen,
inquiring about the varieties of tea. Maybe she would look for it for the
rest of the afternoon and nobody would mind that Alice stood there, at a
strange angle.
“I found peppermint,” reported the girl, “but I’m afraid it’s pretty
old.”
“I don’t mind,” Alice tried to look at the girl, but she couldn’t lift her
gaze further than the apron’s tie.
“Maybe you’d be better off with this?” The girl put a small metal cup
in between Alice’s hands, pouring an autumn brown liquid from an unlabelled bottle. “It helps me when I have seizures,” she said, timidly. “It’s
pretty strong.”
Alice looked at her again, this time reaching all the way up to her
eyes, focusing on her face while carefully trying to pick up one hand
from the table. The pain thundered until Alice had rearranged the re­
──
319
maining hand, almost touching the glass. Then Alice held her breath,
picked it up and swallowed the contents at once. Now there was also a
fire in her mouth, her throat. The warmth almost instantly melted the
knots.
“You can keep the bottle, if you want.”
“I think it was that spinach soup,” said Alice short of breath from relief, “it had the most unusual taste to it.”
“My aunt brings one every time she visits. She’d be happy to know it
helped you, too.”
Alice took the bottle from the girl and the peppermint tea bag.
“You saved my life,” she said, and reached for her purse. The young
girl shook her head.
“It’s fine,” she said, “on the house. What a place!” They looked at
each other like two people who had been neighbours for many years, but
never talked to each other before. Then Alice prepared herself to turn
back to the crowd.
──
320
***
“OF COURSE I haven’t cracked it, but having access to all the tablets
in England was important. It’s a shame I can’t publish anything based on
the unpublished material.” Alice wasn’t sure if this was the sixth or seventh time she had heard herself saying that exact same sentence today.
She wondered if she should try to bring more variance to the narrative.
She wondered if the fact that men’s glasses were so much greasier than
women’s correlated somehow with the loss of hair. She wondered what it
was about the Guggenheim that people felt obliged to have a little chat
with her. People who had never talked to her before suddenly made conversation as if there had been the sanguine sound of wine glasses chinking years back, as if knowing that a person exists means supporting
them in every possible way and thus being part of their success. Alice
nodded to the cavalcade of words her interlocutor was turning loose. It
was about England, of course, Mr. Wunschle’s England. Everybody had
their own British Empire, Alice had learned. Even though she had been
there herself, had seen the colleges, the river, the punting, the beer, the
weather, the tea, she couldn’t possibly have seen the colleges, rivers, water sports, cold beverages, meteorological conditions, hot beverages that
Mr. Wunschle had seen there before the war (which one remained unsaid and even it had been WWI it wouldn’t have retarded Mr. Wunschle’s
fervour of sharing his knowledge of the world), so he had to tell her.
It must be an American thing, Alice thought, telling people where
they have been, what they have experienced. Probably it would be too
pleonastic to bring news to the New World. She sucked cheek flesh
──
321
between her left rows of teeth and started to chew. With the other half
of her face Alice smiled, alert. She missed the quiet coruscation of wellassorted politeness of St. Hugh’s2
. Where for the first time it had not only
been effortless but joyous to talk to strangers.
“I think it’s the different quality of having a past altogether, don’t
you think?” Alice was surprised by the actual pause that followed and
was left for her to deposit her opinion.
“I think it’s exactly like Carr wrote: England, for some reason too remote to grasp, is older than its oldest tales.”
“Who wrote that?”
“Carr. Hag’s Nook? It’s quite good.”
“Never heard of him.”
“A detective novel set in England,” Alice said, “it’s brilliant.” She expected him to end the conversation with some sort of mumbling
shoulder patting manoeuvre — another thing only men could do and
some indeed with perfection—, which would give her the opportunity to
finally talk to Franklin. He was standing there in his slightly too-tight
suit jacket and with his head, that Alice always felt she had never seen
before, square and acutely round at the same time. Franklin was lighting
a cigarette.
“I know it sounds crazy, but in this stone cottage, in the middle of a
thunderstorm, I read The Hound of the Baskervilles to my wife and I
swear we were so scared that I had to continue reading to distract us
from the fact that we were literally in the middle of nowhere, and that
we could hear all kinds of sounds that didn’t seem to be normal at all.”
“If you like Doyle, you will love Carr.” Alice tried to outmanoeuvre
him by insisting on her topic, but quickly saw that there must be a reason why the word manoeuvre began with ‘man’ and not with ‘woman’: He
was opening his briefcase to find his notebook to jot down the author’s
──
322
name, but it took forever to find. So why wouldn’t he start to question
her, to make the interruption worth his while?
“Did you get a lot of reading done on the trip?”
Now, Alice missed the old lizard days. Sucked to the wall, being indistinguishable from the stone, the wallpaper, the water-repellent paint.
Reluctantly but appreciatively heating up her poiklothermic body with
whatever achievement or hypothesis heat the front row crowd was emitting. She just wanted to talk to Franklin, to thank him for all the cable
pulling. Maybe also thank him for having stirred her up a little bit, for
making her realise the idleness which had crept into her life and plans.
Why hadn’t she ever thought of getting another job? The house, mother,
the salary: all of it felt a bit of a constraint now where before it had been
reassuring.
Mr. Wunschle clicked with his pen a couple of times to get Alice’s attention.
“Carr?” he asked.
“Precisely,” she answered. “Hag’s Nook, it’s the first of the Dr. Fell
series. He wrote it when he just had moved over there and the American
perspective on England is incorporated rather nicely, I think. No hounds
though, I’m afraid. But an intriguing case of cryptography.”
For a split second both of them had a melting in their eyes, caused by
respective memories, too fleeting to be recorded.
“Thank you, Miss Kober,” Wunschle said, clapping his notebook shut,
“I will let you know next year how we liked it. Keep up the good work!”
“You’re welcome,” Alice said, but he was already arriving at the next
conversation, saying “Believe it or not, I also had a pair of those garters
once!”

I have bad news. I have been told quite unofficially that we have offered
the job in Indo­European to Hoenigswald. The committee has never met
again, so the decision was made by the Deans, and the committee was not
even informed. I heard of it from Speiser, who heard it from Dean Williams,
so I am afraid that it is authentic enough.
I am terribly disappointed about it, perhaps more so than you will be. I
was dreaming wonderful dreams of the terrific set­up we would have here
with you and the Minoan collection. Rodney Young is coming in as my associate curator, you know. The three of us really could have gone places.
Hoenigswald is a good man, but it won’t be quite the same.
It may give you some satisfaction to know that you were very close to
getting it; if one person had swung from opposition to all known candidates
to support, I think that we could have swung it. But that is spilled milk.
It seems to me that under the present conditions we should give up the
plan for the “Minoan Institute” in your favor. It is obvious that I will have
neither the time to run the thing properly, nor the knowledge to make adequate use of it. It certainly should be where you can watch its growth and
use the material.
I will be gone by the time you get back; in fact I sail for Greece on the
same day that you sail from England on your way home.

ALICE SAT IN front of her typewriter, but the fingers weren’t following her thoughts. “It may give you some satisfaction to know that you
were very close to getting it; if one person had swung from opposition to
all known candidates to support, I think that we could have swung it.”
Alice felt a may-green tingling inside her head. It was not very painful,
but she was unable to ignore it.
Alice wasn’t sure whom she needed to cheer up: herself or him. He
who had put in so much effort to support her. He. Expectation. Ambition.
Results. Trust.
Alice imagined that she’d have a cat and that precisely this cat would
jump into her lap right now, because apparently those beings can sense
even the smallest question in the human soul and rub all the troubles
away with their fur, just until the sparks spray through darkness.
Alice watched how the light withdrew from the room, backwards and
consequential.

Well, it was fun while it lasted. I can’t say your news was unexpected,
because I am a pessimist from way back, and always expect the worst—hoping to be pleasantly surprised.
I’m much more bothered about the “Minoan Institute”. I do not like the
idea of starting it at Brooklyn. First, I doubt that it could be done, and
second, if it could, it would be all tied up in red tape, college, city and state.
In addition, it would be rather hard for me to walk out on it, and one result
of your getting me to consider leaving, is that I really considered it, and
came to the conclusion that it would be necessary, sooner or later.
I don’t think there would be much to do about it at first. If you could
keep it at Pennsylvania, I’d gladly come down to get it into order, and, every
so often, to look after it. That’s what I thought of doing in the first place,
when I suggested it. I don’t see how it could possibly require more than one
Saturday a month, or something like that. When you consider that I’m jogging off to England for something similar, and in some ways perhaps hardly
as important, you can see that I really mean it. After all, Philadelphia is
right next door. But of course, that is up to you and the museum.

Be sure to get Athene on your side in Greece. She sounds like a useful
goddess for an archaeologist.
──
327
Be sure.
Be safe.
Be rock.
Maybe Athene was tired of all those people coming to her country, opening up the soil with foreign words and metal blades of some sort to dig up
things that didn’t belong to them, no matter how highly they valued their
importance. Maybe she was done with the past and wanted answers for a
contemporary world: post­war, post­peace. Maybe she couldn’t get her head
around the fact that they would continue to painstakingly produce remnants
of civilisations gone for millennia, despite humankind’s recent ruins staring
back at them. What could they possibly learn? That everything will be
covered up eventually, as a silent layer of stagnation and stone, slowly
jerking down towards the only ultimate truth: the liquid fire. Athene stubbed
out her cigarette in the palm of her hand. What had they learned over the
past decades that was of any use for the future? Sometimes, she thought, it’s
not that bad to have a body sculpted from marble. If only she could replace
the sempiternal tunic with present­day clothing, that is, a tailored, fate blue
suit. But Athene didn’t want to be slowed down by wardrobe issues. She
was what her therapist calls indignant (in order to avoid the horrible word
hysterical), and she would have loved to see some olive trees burn. You
know, it’s really hard to light matches with marble hands, almost impossible.
All that slow motion bending, mobilised by wasted volition. Athene in no
way felt a wish to be memorable today, a day too bright to think. And what
was the point in delaying death when everything ultimately had to go on the
journey into the soil, sediment by sediment? Athene couldn’t even be
bothered to follow the course of events: was it really an intractable heart
stumbling over a rock on the plains of Turkey, or was it a poisoned heart3
,
soundlessly squashed in its almost black covert? She just looked up—a
beam of light, bouncing off the window of a car door being opened hurriedly, slid as an ellipse over her half­exposed chest—and it had already
happened.

I did not write more about Daniel because I myself had no information.
He died in Turkey, while he was exploring for a site to excavate for the University Museum. He was with Rodney Young, who is now his successor at
the Museum. Young came back for a few weeks in January, and told me all I
know. Daniel seems to have died from a heart­attack—although I suspect
the doctors did not examine him too carefully. They had just finished inspecting a site, and were in an automobile, going to another place, when
Daniel, who had apparently been in the best of health, complained of feeling ill. In half an hour, he was unconscious, and in two or three hours more,
was dead. He was taken to Cyprus, and buried at Episcope. That’s all I
know. It is very sad. I still can’t believe it.
I am afraid our civilization is doomed. Whatever happens, the freedom
of the individual will be lost, and for generations we will live in war or under the threat of war. The dreams of the 18th and 19th century are gone. The
prospect is too gloomy to think of.

ALICE SAW THE bronze firefly of someone else’s cigarette too late,
her steps already adding their frequency to the other material’s vibration. The door falling shut with its sharp thump like someone gasping
from a shock of considerable but expected pain. She stopped right there,
next to the door, leaning against the welding studs, feeling the wall’s
warmth despite the wind. Alice closed her eyes for a moment, trying to
get rid of the impression of her respiratory passages being overgrown
with moss. How did her mother endure the passage in a cabin full of other people, and her own body full with a child?1
 It had always sounded so
easy once they were finally on board, so exciting and frictionless. Also,
her own first crossing2
 had been smooth, at least Alice can’t remember
any feeling that is comparable to those now: all there is in this floating
metropolis is friction and pounding and radiated heat3
. And all the proportions in complete disarray, one couldn’t help but thinking Lewis Carroll didn’t have his original idea in a beautiful garden overlooking the
English seaside, but in a vessel’s bowels just like this one where the smallest suitcase, the tiniest body part like a toe, an ear ends up overcrowding an unmanageable amount of space.
“I wish one could sleep out here,” the voice opposite of Alice in the
dark said, a woman with the faintest French accent. “I’ve even tried to
bribe a steward, but he said it’s impossible. Maybe he also thought I was
joking. But how could one be joking under these circumstances?”
“And this is only the first night,” answered Alice, again calculating
that it would be impossible not to be sleeping during passage, though it
──
332
was less about the not sleeping and more about the tiredness upon arrival in Europe.
“I’m Didi,” said the woman. But Alice just wanted this night to be
over.
Alice’s eyes kept sinking from the page, from the horizon to a dim inward place. Despite her exhaustion she didn’t want to let herself go to
sleep. She imagined the tiredness as sap, dripping from the edge of her
rib cage, crystallising in the warm air and falling as a gemlike bit of colophony on a pyramid-shaped pile.
“Take this before dinner tonight,” said yesterday’s voice, which belonged to a woman with a hat-like haircut, neat and geometric, the hair
dark with bits of white. The face very small, with almost too-precise features. Alice thought of a giraffe drawn in a kid’s book. Didi held a little
pill on her hand. It didn’t say eat me, Alice realised to her surprise.
“Don’t worry, I got it from the doctor,” said Didi, “I was so miserable
in the night. It feels like swallowing clouds.”
Alice took the little round.
“Do you mind if I take this one?” Didi pointed at the deckchair next
to Alice’s.
“Please.”
“Will you tell me your name if I tell you a secret?” asked Didi, making
her accent stronger than it was.
“I’m sorry. I’m Alice. Alice Kober from Brooklyn. I thought I had told
you. But I am so tired, I heard the table’s shadow speak to me earlier.”
“What did it say?”
“Something about a coronation.”
Didi laughed while spreading out her towel on the chair. She wore a
long and wide dress, plain but comfortable.
──
333
“The secret is they have a special stock of food for people who aren’t
there for the meals in time. It’s nothing spectacular, but it’ll fill us up.”
Didi looked at Alice as if she had just performed a magic trick. Alice
shrugged.
“We can sleep here, outside, during the day. And at night we can sit
somewhere, talk, and even get some food.”
“I don’t think that we’re allowed to do that.”
“Why not? Why would they get to tell us what to do?” Didi laughed.
She produced another little pill from her dress pocket, held it up towards Alice before she swallowed it.
“Come on, I know you need it.”
“I don’t usually believe in people who claim to know what I need.”
Didi lay down, making pragmatic adjustments, closing her eyes.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude. I appreciate your help.”
“You’re a terrible liar,” yawned Didi. “Talking like a knife, that’s a
gift.”
Alice had no idea what that meant. There was a knife, yes, but not in
her mouth. It peeled away the skin from the skull, constantly scraping
behind her eyes, amplifying the rocking unbearably. Through Didi’s fingers ran a wave-like motion, so peaceful and harmonic that it didn’t
seem human at all. More like an articulate flock of birds or sea weed.
Alice couldn’t bring herself to stop looking at Didi’s hand. As long as it
was moving, both of them would be alright.
The sleep pattern normalised more quickly than expected, alongside
with the extremities’ sizes. But it became a habit to sit at the far corner
table in the restaurant after dinner, between the orchestral dance music
in the ballroom next door and the muffled rattling from the kitchen.
Alice worked on the inscriptions and Didi tried to write without thinking, bent her body in worrying shapes or conversed with her organs.
Alice was never sure whether that was some sort of joke or a code for
──
334
taking a nap, but Didi insisted that she had to visit her inner parts regularly.
Alice also wasn’t sure, at the beginning, if Didi’s being with her was a
joke or an escape from a husband with high-proof breath or a strong
leaning towards endless rhetorical questions. But it turned out that Didi
was also travelling alone and Alice’s company was a welcome crossing
between shelter and canvas. Alice was astounded to discover the many
people Didi consisted of. Her gentleness and readiness to immerse herself in whatever caught her interest was what connected them. Her serene admiration for Alice seemed quite ridiculous to her, given how often Didi talked about something Alice had never heard of before: books,
music, places, artists, many of them even from New York. In return, Didi
didn’t know much about Antiquity and made Alice talk about her work.
In these conversations (free of both ignorance and over-ambition), Didi’s
way of listening and questioning made Alice’s life exciting, funny and
glorious. It was as if someone had flicked a light switch Alice hadn’t even
noticed before. “I like you, and I like me when I’m with you,” Alice said,
but it was not a confession or something which involved deep emotions.
It just was the truth. “As long as it is true, everything can be said,” Didi
had once stated. Before having met Didi, Alice had been the same person
all the time. A condition that now seemed like a waste of time to her.
 They liked old couples, but only if the wife joined the conversation.
They liked solitary people, but only if they had a profession they were
interested in. Members of the crew they generally liked, but only after
their shift had ended. They would smoke together, hear some gossip, and
more often than not, be treated to leftovers from the kitchen or a glass
from the bar. Alice and Didi were absolutely certain that the food which
someone snuck out for them on a wrinkled napkin or in a warm hand
──
335
tasted way better than the real meals they were served on proper plates.
Sometimes Alice felt like she had turned into a creature, half cat, half
girl, from royalty: young enough to be ignorant about the concept of
privilege. Didi had this tiny, content smile when she nibbled on a tarte or
canapé, which must have been what motivated the benefactors to outdo
themselves. Some, of course, had tried to sweet-talk Didi into some kind
of service in return. In these situations, too, Didi had this tiny, content
smile, but she would turn her head to Alice as if to listen to a sentence
that had slipped her attention just a second ago. It was a gesture without
ambiguity or artificiality, a curtain being drawn. At nights, Alice always
walked Didi to her cabin before finding her way back to hers. Even
though Didi assured her that she didn’t have to take care of her, late in
the evenings, Alice usually started to feel like a mother towards Didi, or
at least what she supposed that might be like: wanting to be a blanket
and cover the conglomerate of skin, hair and vulnerability, softly yet
tightly.
On the last day, the coastline already in sight, she wore one of Didi’s
wide, flag-like dresses. They had changed their clothes for a photo that a
steward took with Didi’s camera. Alice, the Latin teacher, became Didi,
the dance teacher, who had at some point in her life decided that she
wouldn’t waste any time on how to dress, ordering two identical dresses
from the French-Japanese seamstress down her street, every season. It
was petrol blue with little yellow dots. It had smelled like over-boiled
milk, lingering sweetness against the pungent width of the sea. Didi had
plenty of space in Alice’s blouse and skirt. She looked like a girl playing
at dressing like a grown-up, a girl with grey hair and grey clothes, even
though they weren’t really grey. Alice was startled, but she didn’t have
time to process the impression she had made on herself. The picture was
──
336
taken, and after the steward gave the camera back, Didi put a little slip
of paper in Alice’s skirt.
“This is my number and my address. If you need anything, you call
me. If I’m not home, my housekeeper Cecile will answer, she is a little
confused, so make sure you tell her to write down whatever message you
want her to pass me and also let her read it to you. Sometimes she only
pretends to be scribbling because she’s too weary to go find a pen. When
I was a girl, she took care of me and now it’s sort of the other way round.
It’s so beautiful and peaceful when things become their opposite. Where
was I? Oh yes, I’m looking forward to the day I open the newspaper and
see your face, beaming with pride, because you’ve figured it out. This
will be your message to me, your greetings across the ocean. D’accord?”
Alice nodded and smiled. “I’d love that,” she said, pulling the belt
open.
“Keep it, it looks wonderful on you,” said Didi, “if you promise me to
wear it on your way back.” Alice hadn’t thought of the way back, of
crossing the ocean without Didi. All her inner images had concerned Oxford and Myres and Linear B. Even in her dreams, she had been handling
Linear B tablets, most of them mysteriously wiped clean or the inscriptions illegibly small. In one dream it turned out that, once the signs were
visible, it was plain English. When she woke up, Alice couldn’t remember
the contents of the inscriptions now easily readable, only the heavy coat
of disappointment at having worked so hard for years to find out that it
had been there, right before her eyes, all the time.
“If you don’t like it, you don’t have to keep it,” Didi said.
“No, sorry, of course I like it. Sorry. I had just never thought about
the return, which of course is silly. Going there was so important that
leaving never entered my thoughts.”
──
337
“Don’t worry,” said Didi, “I understand. Some journeys indeed have
only one direction, even if they end where they started physically. I so
hope that yours is going to be one of those!”
She stepped out of Alice’s clothes and stood there in her black and
white swimming costume. The wind made the small blond hairs on her
arms stand up. As Alice didn’t move to take off the robe, Didi put the
clothes on Alice’s deck chair and went to the pool. She jumped into the
water without making a splash, like a blade had plunged in. Alice heard
herself panting for air, even though air was the only thing in abundance.
She tried to untie the belt, but she had drawn the ends so close that the
knot was tight like a pebble. Then Alice sat down. She imagined Didi,
whose head moved through the water slightly bouncing up and down,
sitting at a large breakfast table with a silver coffee set, croissants and a
bowl full of fruit. Around her a wide array of colourful patterns: the wallpaper, the carpets, the curtains, the books.

***
Alice kept reminding herself that the bed was steady, as was the
room, the house, the ground. The brain mixed up the angles relentlessly.
If only she knew how to calm it down. If only she knew how to calm herself down, her belly filled with a combination of anticipation and fidgetiness that is reserved for children right before Christmas. As a child she
would have itemised the presents she might get. A purple pencil. A magnifying glass. A casket with fish made from mother of pearl. As a woman
in her early forties she was thinking of Myres, of walking up to his
house, of ringing the bell, saying her name. Then she thought of the tablets, imagined some of them on a desk of hayfield green leather. The tablets led her, mercifully, to the corner of her brain where all the questions
were stored in open drawers. She rummaged through them for quite a
while, rearranged and re-rearranged them. Then a church bell rang,
Alice wasn’t sure if it was three or quarter to something, dragging herself out of bed. Was it morning back home now, or evening? Glistening
grains of light trickling through her skull. She put on the clothes she had
thrown on the biggest of her suitcases, unlocked her door and tried to go
downstairs without making too much noise. The nighttime manager was
asleep in a chair-sized room behind the counter, which was buried under
a load of porcelain animals that Alice couldn’t make out. She pushed the
heavy entrance door open and took a deep breath of silent air. She was
alone, but it felt different to being the only one on the streets of Brooklyn. There, it was a transient state which, especially at night, carried the
suspicion of some sort of misunderstanding. The emptiness was full of
──
339
incidences, you just couldn’t spot them in the dark. Whereas here, on
this little street, Alice felt confined by the absence of daylight and
people, the darkness was a blanket that covered her. There wasn’t light
in even one window. It was almost three, and everybody was asleep like
they ought to be. Alice felt strong, almost invincible. She had made it
that far and now it wasn’t a sentence in her head or her letters anymore
—it is hard to realise that in a little over a month I’ll be in the same town
with the Scripts, and actually under the same roof at times, not to speak
of being actually able to talk to some who knows them4
—, it was a fact,
like the crisp smell of the pine, maple and linden trees enclosing the
houses, the majority of which seemed to date back to the middle ages.
She turned left and the sudden presence of the Ashmolean startled
her. As if it had jumped at her from behind the corner, with a mischievous smile. She looked at it, read the opening times on a plaque next to
the entrance and rearranged the scale of the map in her head—what she
had considered to be a walk of at least half an hour was less than ten
minutes. She smiled. Then she walked on, to see how long it would take
her to get to Sir Myres’ home.
When she reached Canterbury Road she stopped. What if Myres or
someone else from his house saw her? What was she thinking? Why
would she walk here in the middle of the night? It was as if she had twisted her ankle: stepping into a void that wasn’t actually there but wouldn’t hesitate to break her foot. What was wrong with her? Before she
could turn around, she had come undone. What would she even say to
him? She hurried back, the crisp air now cutting into her cheeks and
hands like blades of grass. She shouldn’t be wandering around. She
should be preparing. In her room she opened her suitcase and couldn’t
figure out what to wear. The chequered dress was a good compromise
between formal and elegant, but it was quite warm and there was no way
to open up a button or tuck in the sleeves. A skirt with a blouse and a
──
340
cardigan would be better temperature-wise, but looked quite bland.
Alice pulled out every garment she had packed and placed it on the bed,
the table, the chair. Nothing seemed to match. Since when was she
thinking about what to wear? She used to make fun of women who spent
time considering their wardrobe. Didn’t they have more important
things to attend to? Alice only had thought about the tablets, the knowledge that would be within reach. She hadn’t thought about the body
which would carry her to that knowledge. A fit of dizziness forced Alice
to bed. She lay down on Didi’s dress and the faint smell of her perfume
slowly brought Alice back into the room. She slipped into it and brushed
the rest of the clothes aside. She couldn’t get up to turn off the lights:
sleep hit her like an anaesthetic. Coarsely cutting out a stretch of time
and replacing it with nothing but an ever-so dry mouth.

A visit to the Ashmolean Antiquities Study Room in Oxford is of great
importance for my work, I wrote to David, head of culture of the Swiss embassy, asking him for a letter of recommendation. He adapted the text about
the project as I had drafted it, changing “great” to “utmost”: “access to the
resources at your institution would be of utmost importance to her work.” I
like utmost a lot, so sophisticated and pressing on its own, more a monolithic peak than a word.
Having access to a real tablet for the first time, taking it out of its little
transparent plastic box, putting the tag aside. Seeing and feeling what the
photographs had never revealed: The tablets aren’t flat (I’ve always imagined them like a flattened ball of clay, somehow ragged and not defined)—
only the side which contains the inscriptions is flat, very flat actually, somehow polished. The back is up to a couple of centimetres thick and shaped
like a half­moon, so that the tablets rock if put on their backs on the table.
And the sides: absolutely straight and flawless, no fingerprints. The edges
carefully rounded in even angles. So specific that there must have been
moulds. In a mould, the surface, written on later, would be at the bottom, but
this side is slightly wider than the back of the tablet, which would have been
the upper part of the mould. How could the tablet be removed from a mould
when the lower part is bigger than the upper? I kept running my gloved fingertips over the sides, trying to think with my hands.
The writing itself: accurately defined lines in most cases, carved into the
clay with great (utmost) precision. It must have been a metal stylus, in some
cases as thin as a needle. The line in many cases is absolutely straight,
formed with some sort of ruler that might have been pressed into the clay.
──
342
On the backs, the fingerprints of those who made tablets: a deferred
touch spanning over 3000 years, discontinued by the glove’s thinnest layer
of white rubber and my childlike astonishment. I recognise a small number
of signs: sheep, chariot, fabric. The button, which in some instances means
and and in others something else. I can read the syllable po and ni, because
pony is my nickname. But, of course, I would need to learn Ancient Greek
in order to really understand. My fingertips try their utmost best. Weighing
the tablets in my hands, noticing every detail there possibly is. A knowledge
that lies in the touch. An understanding that can’t be translated into the
words of any language, ancient or modern. An understanding that is nothing
more and nothing less than presence wrapped in the thinnest layer of blankness. A layer containing all that was touched and didn’t remain, and all that
was touched and remained in silence.

The day you wrote the letter to Franklin, in which you asked him to
make sure that Athene is on his side, has a great significance to you. It is
August 24 in 1948, you are in Oxford with Myres, helping him get Scripta
Minoa II published. He had wanted you to go to Crete to check the inscriptions’ originals, but you couldn’t do it as they weren’t accessible, reburied in
a vault to protect them from the war. Also, it wouldn’t have been possible to
get unpaid leave from Brooklyn College, given your sabbatical one year
earlier5
. Instead of going to Greece you are, during the summer holidays,
visiting him again in Oxford to assist him with SM II6
.

344
My second day in Oxford. In the morning, before the the Ashmolean’s
study room opens, I walked to St. Hugh’s College, where you stayed in Oxford. It was parent’s day and I was repeatedly asked if wanted to take a
guided tour. I said no politely and tried behave as if I had a daughter of the
right age, who just happened to not be with me right now, but usually was. I
imagined carrying her sweater in my backpack and her water bottle, because
she had insisted, against my advice, on not bringing a practical bag but a
cool one. I imagined the softness of the sweater, of the embroidered banana
tree flowers. But I couldn’t imagine having a body which has the memory of
having another one inside. I decided to leave my sunglasses on, and made
my way through the college determined, as if I knew where to go, as if I was
expected somewhere.
I saw the same buildings you had seen, I saw the dining hall, I saw the
little chapel. I saw the garden and park and I wondered why you didn’t write
anything about it in your letters7
. It must have been there in your day, too,
and I guess the grass was already neatly cut. Maybe the little hoops waiting
for croquet players were even in place. You just weren’t impressed. What
impressed you was how they talked Latin to each other8
, how much respect
the students had for the teachers. You made friends, I had read the day before in the Myres correspondence with Dorothea Gray, an archaeologist9
.
You kept exchanging letters and, of course, they are not preserved—at least
not in the Dorothea Gray Papers at St. Hugh’s archive and I don’t know
where else I could look for them. Even though I should now be used to be
finding nothing, I get so excited by a new lead every time.
──
345
I had read the letters you exchanged with Myres a couple of times—on
my way back to the Ashmolean I walked by his house at 13 Canterbury
Road, just on the opposite end of St. Hugh’s Park. Nowadays there is a
fence, but back then his house might have been accessible through the trees.
Because I had so much time left in the study room, I asked to see the MyresVentris correspondence. For no specific reason, just to make the most, utmost, of my time. I always feel this froth of rage rising inside when Ventris
is involved. He is, after all, the main reason why you are portrayed as a cold,
feisty woman, full of disdain for amateurs in general and Ventris in particular.
You telling him that compiling assumptions on Linear B in his Mid Century Report is a waste of time. That you were fatally ill at that time and
couldn’t even walk up stairs anymore is always overlooked. This is what
struck me in the Myres letters: The last ones you wrote to him—containing
a damning review of his manuscript for Scripta Minoa III that you were supposed not only to correct, but in fact to type for him—yes, you indeed are
feisty in those (but nobody ever quotes from them). From how your handwriting has changed, you must have been in considerable pain. The letters
are compressed into illegibility, what had been steady and round is now
spiky and tipping over. The effort that writing demanded from you is so visible that reading your rants is doubly painful.
──
346
You allegedly made Ventris leave Oxford in August 1948: helter­skelter,
disenchanted, humiliated even. The story that is told is the following: you
two met there, during your second visit to Oxford, after both of you had
agreed to help Myres with Scripta Minoa. You with the classification,
Ventris with drawing the inscriptions. Letters had been exchanged throughout spring between the three of you on how best to go about the task.10
Ventris wouldn’t have had any problem getting a job as King Minos’ scribe,
you joked to Myres after seeing his page design sketch (AK to SJM, 13
March 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres Correspondence). But then
Ventris flees the scene, apologising to Myres for his weak mind, for being a
swine and letting him down (MV to SJM, 23 August 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres Correspondence). His comprehension “I shall stick to my last”
is quoted in this matter, taken as a hint that you were looking down on him,
browbeating (what an excellent word) him for being a dilettante.
It is here, in Oxford, that Kober’s and Ventris’s stories dovetail
for the first, painful time. Ventris had also been summoned to Oxford
in the summer of 1948 to help prepare Scripta Minoa II for publication, ad he arrived during Kober’s visit. But, apparently cowed by
the combined scholarly power of Kober and Myres, he quickly fled
the scene, a pattern of abdication he would repeat throughout his life.
(Fox 2013: 173)
And it is indeed a peculiar letter, this one, written on August 23, at Oxford station. It is an outburst, it is written in a voice that had never before
occurred and never occurs after in Ventris’ letters to Myres. Or to anyone
else, in fact, as far as the letters in the Ventris archive (IoCS) are concerned.
It is a hoarse voice that doesn’t find its comfortable pitch. The hand that
writes is reaching through the paper into the the dark.

23 August 1948 –––--––Ashmolean
Michael Ventris to Sir John Myres
Dear Sir John,
You will probably think me quite mad if I try & account for the reasons
why I’ll be absent on Tuesday morning, & why I should like to ask either
Miss Kober, or the other girl that you mentioned, to complete the transcription. One would have thought that years in the Forces would have cured one
of irrational & irresistible impulses of dread and homesickness.
One would have thought
One just one singled out
From the lively many
One just one slowly yet
Not fatally grazed by the
Fields unwinding themselves
In between stilts and trust
One that one’s just about
To be swallowed by coppice
That years in the Forces
Or hours on a train or
Instincts in a hollow or
Muteness in a scarp slope or
A second without breath or
The lifetime of a tree
──
348
Would have cured one
Yes that one in the station’s
Hall there the one with the blazing
Outlines who keeps circling his
Sturdy suitcase that doesn’t have
Enough arms to put around him to
Touch his shoulder or hair or the
Drape of the neck and doesn’t whisper
Or hum or comfort in any other way
Of dread and homesickness
One can’t be cured reliably by
Dropping matter accelerated into
Family homes or farms or verticalness
In general because that’s what one
Is sensitive to the case the shelter
The skin

Isn’t it remarkable that the only force that should be at the centre of such
weakness is a woman? Reluctantly, a woman is credited for great achievements. But without a doubt she is capable of having power over a man, so
evil that he doesn’t even care about losing his face in front of a living legend
of the field he is working in. A man who has served in the army as a bomber
navigator. A man who, as an architect, is used to working under pressure and
also with difficult people. A man who is a genius.
A man is a genius if he’s, in short, built from squared paper made out of
rare and precious metal.
A genius is a man whose edges are extremely sharp, he cuts easily
through fallacy and folly, not necessarily in this order, but behold, he might.
A man is a genius if his being is so lissom inside that it’s almost liquid:
permanent ink that levels him or makes him rise.
A woman is a genius if she tries to be a man, albeit the squares, the
edges, the permanency spilled inside, all tipped and strident and hoarse.
──
350
Thinking about the established, dreadful woman scholar interpretation of
the swine­letter is irreproducible to me. Why would someone who in blithe
spirits participated in the pulverisation of Cologne be shattered by meeting
someone who is more experienced in a certain field? But this logic goes
both ways, probably: Why would someone who, in stable confidence, will
solve the whole riddle in four years’ time, collapse on a Monday night in a
small town’s train station for no reason at all? Sir John Myres made a note
on the letter, following his usual habit, when he received it (August 24) and
when he answered it (August 24).
To state the obvious: I was hoping to find this reply from Myres to
Ventris in the Ventris Papers (IoCS), because it would have let me know,
without doubts, whether or not there had been a meeting. But what is preserved in the archive is mainly the letters Ventris wrote to his wife Lois during his time in the army—creating his own army of texts, writing her every
day and sometimes twice, at least at the beginning. Later on he combines his
letters to her with his diary, to save him some time.
The voice I encounter there is confident. The only sign of insecurity is
the number of letters, the large portion of the free time the writing must
have taken up: it is writing that isn’t telling or longing, it’s not writing
which is directed into the distance, but writing that is very much rooted in
the realm of its surroundings. It gives the addressee a materialised presence,
turning the paper into her body. A patient white body, delicate but clearly
confined, a body that can be owned like a plot of land, promising soil.
Crackling rime, solid blue. For years and years it awaits the ink, feeling it
dripping down the throat as a light and steady stream. All this neat control
went in Ventris’ letter to Myres written at Oxford station: The sentences
even wind up with mistakes and logical errors. The body reared up, becoming an inhospitable territory of its own.

23 August 1948 ––––––Ashmolean
Michael Ventris to Sir John Myres
But however much I tell myself that I am a swine to let you down after
all my glib promises & conceited preparations,—I am hit at last by the overwhelming realization that I shall not be able to stand 6 weeks work alone in
Oxford, & that I am an idiot not to stick to my own last. Perhaps its [sic]
greater weakmindedness to throw up the sponge, than to grind on with
something one’s liable to make a botch job of—I don’t know.

“I don’t mind picking the things up, a little walk will be good.” Alice
looked at the woollen blanket which was wrapped tightly around the
lower half of his body. Sir Myres seemed to live in an entirely different
season. His hands held a cleanly-cut open letter.
“And I do have time.” He nodded with his eyes.
“What a shame,” he said, “He would have done splendid work,
wouldn’t he?”
Alice nodded. His theories were one thing, but his handwriting was
another. It looked like he used a stencil for every single letter he wrote.
Alice imagined his face wrinkled from focusing so hard on accuracy.
Wrinkled, but tidy. Alice thought of four absolutely parallel lines on
Ventris’ forehead, not even meeting in infinity.
“Shall I talk to the press,” she asked, “to let them know?”
“We’ll find another solution. I have to make up my mind. A young
man with a business and a family, a whole range of commitments. It
would have been a splendid arrangement, though.” Myres’ voice ebbed
away, but he didn’t clear his throat. Alice fanned herself with her notebook. She was in two minds about what was expected from her: sitting
and conversing or leaving and getting something done. Myres himself
didn’t seem to know either. His body was there, out of bed and dressed in
a shirt too wide for him, in an extremely dark shade of blue, with golden
cufflinks. In his thoughts, he was already finding ways to answer the letter without further embarrassing the young man or himself. “It was too
──
353
much to ask, but my father always said that no question can be voracious.”
“I’m sure he’d have loved to be of help,” Alice said and shooed away a
fly that kept landing on her sweaty forearm. He indeed had prepared the
whole thing quite systematically. She didn’t understand what had kept
him from coming. An urgent job or a family emergency? But apart from
the question of who should do the drawings now, she wasn’t unhappy
about the fact that she didn’t have to deal with a second opinion that
was based on god knows which assumptions, producing the most reckless ideas. And given the tone of his letters, he wasn’t exactly the modest
type.
“Your brother has served?” Sir Myres asked as if this question was
the logical continuation of a conversation that had been interrupted for
some reason.
“He worked in a lab,” Alice answered. Sir Myres looked at her and
then waved the letter.
“I should write to him before my strength fades.”11
“Of course,” Alice said and her back popped when she got up from
the antique chair that reminded her of a horse carriage seat. She put her
notebook into her purse and straightened her skirt. She felt like a girl
just leaving a private lesson. Probably it was because he wasn’t moving,
couldn’t move, tucked into the armchair. Alice shook his hand and the
letter shook a little in his other hand. Alice wasn’t sure about the subject
of her private lesson, but she felt fairly well-prepared.
“Do you think I should write Mr. Ventris a note, too?” she asked,
turning round at the door.
“I’ll include your best wishes,” Myres said in a voice that suggested
complicity in the delicate domain of diplomacy—he would have done it
anyway. He was handling the situation, whatever it was about, in the appropriate way. It was one of those moments when frailty absent-
──
354
mindedly made room for the grand man to appear, with all his customary aplomb. Alice smiled and suddenly felt how her neck released the
tension from constantly leaning towards him or at least feeling like leaning, involuntarily sharing the assiduous attitude of the women in the
house to be ready in every moment to support him, to carry some
weight, to catch a word that was about to slip his mind.
“Very well then,” she said and almost curtsied, “let’s see what we can
get done on our own.”

A find of utmost importance was a letter from Ventris to Myres written
on Monday, August 16, in Col du Grand Bois in France, one week prior to
the Oxford incident (MV to SJM, 16 August 1948, Ashmolean Museum,
Myres Correspondence). An unburdened letter to let Myres know that the
family vacation took longer than expected, swims in the Mediterranean are
mentioned, the kids, Lois, his wife. Ventris says he can’t make it to Oxford
before the beginning of the next week:
Dear Sir John,
I’m afraid our return journey is still taking slightly longer than we estimated, so that we won’t be able to make it to Paris before tomorrow night,
& England before Thursday. The car’s been boiling on passes, & we’ve had
the usual delays with customs & banks & officials—not to mention the lure
of a Mediterranean bathe—all of which has made our return seem almost
interminable. So I am afraid I shall have to put back to the beginning of
next week coming down to Oxford—but I’ll make plans to go on into October till it’s finished, if necessary, & in that case I might be able to do the
Linear A as well.
That means in all likelihood, that Ventris reached Oxford on Monday,
August 23rd, the beginning of the week. And never even left the Oxford train
station. Or he went to a hotel where he planned to stay, cancelled his room
and left the drawing material there (“I have left my small board & 4 pads of
layout paper, which may be useful”).
──
356
In other words, he arrived in Oxford and homesickness greeted him with
wiry arms. His heart started to run through his body, pounding on everything
with the remotest resemblance to a door, in order to get out. Ventris might
have had a panic attack or a nervous breakdown. He might as well have
quietly realised that, in fact, he hadn’t been working on the Minoan problem
since 1940 (see letter to SJM on Easter 1940: “I don’t know whether you remember my writing to you a few years ago about some theories I had on the
elucidation of Minoan. Actually I was only fifteen at the time, and I’m
afraid my theories were nonsense […] However, I have continued to work at
the problem off and on, and I’m coming round more and more to the view
that the language contained in the inscriptions is a dialect closely related to
Etruscan.” Ashmolean Museum, Myres Correspondence). I have searched
the whole correspondence with his wife Lois (IoCS, MV 010­020), which
started in 1942 when he entered the army, for mentions of Linear B. There
are only two:
Letter 21 in 1942, probably written on November 23 (IoCS, MV 010.1­
40)
The other letter was quite a break. It turned out to be from J.L. Myres,
who’s No 1 man on early Greek + Minoan archaeology now that his partner
Evans has died. He said he’d been studying my article, and wanted to know
if I’d done any more since, as he was at work on the problem and his results
agreed with mine on various points. He was really affable, so I’ve written
him back deferentially admitting I haven’t really done any more, but offering
to put in some (humble) help for anyone who really is carrying the thing
through. I hope he’ll let me know how his researches are going, as he’s got
much more material to work on and he’s a big shot, + he’s very cautious, so
whatever he establishes should be pretty echt. But I’m afraid it’ll rather
shake him to find I wrote the opus at 17—I mentioned it half out of conceit
and half out of the thinking the whole thing was rather a joke anyway.
──
357
Letter 22 (IoCS, MV 010.1­40)
Yesterday I got around to the public library which is very nicely set up +
spent the afternoon reading back numbers of the Architectural Review and
looking at Highpoint & the houses at Holland and Cullers’ drawings of
exotic flowers. I also found a book by the archaeologist that wrote me the
other day, in which he seems to have anticipated most of my theory—not
quite all—unbeknown to me.
──
358
The projects Ventris was pursuing during his years in the army were a
study to facilitate language learning which he considered one of the most
important skills to have at a time like his: “I’ve got the full series of Basis
and Essentials language books together now, and I’m beginning to make
plans for a quite detailed parallel study of the chief languages of the world,
which might end up as something publishable, but which is at any rate useful to me” (MV to LV, 24 May 1945, IoCS, MV 016).
“I hold fast to a desire for the progressive federal unity of the world:
soon no place will be more than a day’s journey away from any other, and
we don’t yet think in any commensurate way. […] but in any case the man
with a contribution is not now the man with the dreams, but with the all­embracing technical knowledge and view (often mutually exclusive, alas)”
(MV to LV, 15 April 1945, IoCS, MV 016).
For a while, he worked on tasks from his architecture studies and sent
innumerable sketches and variations of the block of flats to Lois. Then he
designed their family home, relentlessly improving the floor plan. “If I alter
the plan again, divorce me!” (MV to LV, 5 December 1943, IoCS, MV
010.1­40).
He, as a navigator, also developed a device which facilitated the determination of the plane’s exact position. He even instructed Lois to have a prototype built:
“With reference of the drawings of the perspector that I sent you last, in
typical Ventris fashion I must ask you to do nothing definite with them, because I’ve now developed an improvement” (MV to LV, 7 May 1946, IoCS,
MV 017).
He was thorough and greatly occupied with the tasks he set for himself.
He kept revisiting his ideas and questioning his solutions. His strength and
determination seemed to originate from the process itself, from iterating and
improving. The importance of the topic he worked on resulted from the fact
that he was dedicating his time to working on it.
──
359
To me, it seems that this is the most probable driver of him backing out
of assisting Myres. He realised that the confidence to do the job came from
Myres, not from himself, as Ventris had abandoned the whole field almost a
decade ago. Or, as he puts it later in a letter to Bennett, he already then knew
what Alice did not realise until later: Myres didn’t know as much about Linear B as he thought he did.
“I have preserved cordial relations with Myres as far as correspondence
goes, but I have been chary of enquiring after SMII’s progress since a
couple of years back when I offered to help him on it & then, rather disgracefully, backed out of it; largely because I felt the whole project was a bit
out of hand & I didn’t have enough knowledge or ‘personality’ to get it improved” (MV to EB, 1 June 1951, PASP, Ventris Papers, Box 2).
Maybe Ventris had imagined how he would walk up to Myres’ house,
what he would say. The same questions I made Alice ask herself the night
before meeting Myres. I cannot know if that was true for her, but I am pretty
sure that in cases like that a strange thing with dimensions happens: the other person, the one you admire intellectually is suddenly so superior that they
make you small. Precisely by replying yes, they are saying a word that
makes you feel unworthy. It is as if before, the proportions hadn’t really
been graspable. But through their reaching out the scale is fixed, perspective
is determined by the line that the connection forms.
But nobody else who wrote about the Oxford incident took self doubt or
insecurity into consideration. The longer I think about it, the less I understand the prevailing interpretation. Is it because Ventris mentions Kober in
the first line of his letter? Miss Kober or the other girl. Accepting for the
moment the assumption that there had been a clash, then Myres had witnessed it in some way: it must even have taken place at his house. Isn’t it
strange that Ventris should like Myres to ask Miss Kober? Wouldn’t the other girl be easier to mention, in order not to remind Myres of whatever scene
──
360
had taken place earlier that day? Also, in the first letter that seemed to have
been exchanged between Myres and Ventris since the accident – a letter
from 21 December 1948 in which Ventris thanks Myres for sending him an
article – he writes:
“If one believed that the Linear A and Linear B languages were different
(as Miss Kober seems to do), one might be tempted to deduce […] that it
was in some way characteristic to the Mainland…” (Ashmolean Museum,
Myres Correspondence).
Why would he mention her if there had been a scene? Especially as this
reference isn’t relevant or necessary at all, as if Alice’s theory is not only
known to Myres, but Ventris had mentioned it to him in a letter in spring,
before the whole incident:
“I have got into quite an interesting correspondence with Dr. Kober: she
rather startled me by suggesting that ‘Linear A and B certainly do not contain the same language’” (MV to SJM, 25 April 1948, Ashmolean Museum,
Myres Correspondence).
The longer I think about it, the more certain I am that given what Ventris
says in his letters and how, there was no meeting. There simply can’t have
been one.
──
361
The longer I think about the frivolous interpretation that it must have
been Alice who made Ventris leave, the more cynical I become. I know that
being cynical is very personal in this case. When I went through the Ventris
papers to find other instances of weak­mindedness or failing to be on his
own (what did he mean by work alone anyway, as he knew he would have
worked with Myres and Kober) or acting on irrational & irresistible impulses, as he calls them in his letter, I not only learned how many bombings
and operations he flew over Germany, safely noted in his flying log book
(29 missions from July 1944 right to the end of the war, IoCS, MV 014), I
also read that he seemed to have enjoyed them. I can’t help but be cynical.
Not on my behalf, not on behalf of the country whose wine­coloured passport manoeuvres me around the world, not on behalf of an era of debris that
is always busy foreshadowing itself but nobody ever listens closely enough.
I am being cynical as a reader, as a witness of power’s heavily jointed face.
3.3.45
We got up yesterday at the very painful hour of 0115, and in actual fact
the take off was about 7 o’clock. All the same it was one of our best trips—
the final pulverisation of Cologne, with about 600 aircrafts on a very fine
morning.
12.4.45
Yesterday was quite a pleasant reintroduction to the gentle art of operating. We did a daylight under quite clear conditions and at a comfortable
(from a flying point of view) height, on Bayreuth. There was no opposition
at all, and the countryside seemed quite without activity. I looked out for the
Opera House at Bayreuth, but it was hidden behind the smoke. It was a very
good attack, and I saw the bombs go down right into the built­up area
among the shower of little red TIs.
──
362
This diary entry from mid April, in which Ventris goes on describing the
beauty of the German landscape around the Taunus mountains, is decorated
with a drawing of a plane circling a column of smoke. It is done in black
ink, coloured with pencil. (Red, pink, purple.) Cut out and pasted on the paper.
This terrain is imponderable and uncomfortable (from a civilian point of
view) because I know that there is no such thing as a simple connection or
plain causality. But when I sat there, reading, I wanted to get up, point at the
pages, at the drawing and ask someone: Isn’t it downright impossible that a
person who wrote this, a passionate and studious tourist in the face of mass
destruction, could be a person who runs away from a job with a luminary
just because someone else gave him a hard time? He had been introduced to
the gentle art of operating, don’t you know? Wouldn’t he have known how
to defend himself? Or to conveniently block out whatever he couldn’t acknowledge?
──
363
Also, isn’t it strange that if this meeting should have happened, one way
or another, that you, Alice, never ever wrote about it to anyone? I understand that the park at St.Hugh’s wasn’t spectacular to you, piled up pulp,
waving green against the stretched sky of different shades. But getting into a
fight with a coworker, probably in the very house of Sir John Myres who to
you is, like to Ventris, a guiding light12—that would have been news, would
have been an incident that needed to be referenced, commented on even to
Myres in the future. But when you mention Ventris later that year to Myres,
it is with greatest nonchalance: “Most of your other questions I think were
purely rhetorical. Ventris sent me a copy of his work, but I haven’t had the
time to even glance at it. Deroy sent me a copy of his bibliographical article
in the Revue Hittite et Asiatique” (AK to SJM, 8 March 1949, Ashmolean
Museum, Myres Correspondence).

***
Alice hadn’t been to the Royal Oxford since her first nights in England, last year in spring13. Even though the room had been nice and the
staff fine, her memories of the night were labyrinthine and rather dark.
As if she had gotten lost in a city she was a stranger in. But how could
one get lost on a way of two minutes—at least without the idiotic number of three suitcases, which had slowed down her whole journey14—the
hotel almost visible from the tracks. She hadn’t been lost and nothing
unpleasant had happened. It was more actually stepping into the unknown, seeing it taking shape. No. Trespassing the obvious: that the unknown had had a shape, a material, a body all the time, that for others it
had been a trite matter of course. It’s only such a short moment during
which amazement can occur. A wink. Then everything is already
changed. That’s the good thing about archaeology, Alice thought, that
whatever is found stays exactly as it is. You might change, your knowledge might change, but the place, the artefacts they rest. Rest as remains and rest as peace and quiet. All the decisions have been made, for
better or, more often, for worse. No contingencies left to find a solution
for, all aspiration and ambition turned to stone. It was the human condition that one could discover preserved in detail, without having to deal
with actual humans, with their pettiness, their rascality. Alice almost
walked into a duck sitting motionless on the kerb, enjoying the sun and
the breeze. She made a step to the side which flared her skirt. The duck
didn’t blink.
──
365
“What’s wrong with you, little fella,” she asked. The breeze gently
ruffled the duck’s feathers.
“Did nobody teach you to give way to a lady?” The duck made a duck
sound, but still didn’t move.
“Just be careful in the street, alright?” The duck looked at Alice then
it walked away, in the middle of the kerb, proud and miffed like a pedestrian.
It’s a day for walking away, Alice thought, a day for dashing off to
other jobs, more profitable undertakings. She couldn’t stop looking at
the duck wiggling away from her, waving its little rump. She hadn’t been
able to read Myres, if he was angry or disappointed with Ventris he hid it
well. But he did seem to be confused, given the erratic course of their
conversation. Alice thought of inquiring at the hotel about the circumstances of Ventris’ departure. Why wouldn’t he come by this morning
and explain his reasons in person, which seemed like the polite and thus
the British way to handle a situation like this? Didn’t Sir Myres deserve
this much respect? Yes, it was a personal investment to work with him,
but Ventris didn’t have to travel across the globe. He was just an amusing train ride away from home. It was an investment, but also quite a
contribution. Hadn’t he been eager to do this? He who had regaled the
world with his first theory about Minoan while he was a schoolboy,
drinking strawberry milk? Why would he walk away from the opportunity to prove to the world how indispensable he was? Alice shook her
head. At the exact same moment, the duck jumped onto the bridge’s
stone railing and took off.

2 As listed in her CV for the Guggenheim application under “work in
archaeology”, Alice Kober had been to Europe once before, in the summer of 1939:
“examination of archaeological exhibits in European museums, in France,
Germany, Austria, Greece and Italy; examination of important sites in Greece and
Italy; tour of Greece (under American School of Classical Studies in Athens) and
study of newest work of the American, British, French and German schools.”

those meant for one. Conditions even in first class were bad, and in tourist
unspeakable. I wouldn’t advise anyone to make the crossing, except in case of
necessity, and certainly not in tourist class.” (AK to Joseph Pearl, 17 March 1947,
Brooklyn College File).
4 AK to SJM, 6 February 1946.
5 “Myres expects I will go to Greece in February. It’s bad news, because I haven’t
the money, and the best Brooklyn College can do is give me six months’ leave
without pay. Six month is ample time for me and mother to starve to death, since
I’ve spent all my money last year. I’ve been counting on the slowness of the
Greeks, which would postpone the trip till summer. Then, with a year’s salary
under my belt, and pay continuing, I could go to Greece under my own steam. Six
months mean very little to me, but of course, they mean a lot to Myres. Well, for
once maybe the Greeks will be slow when it would be to my advantage.” (AK to
FD, 18 September 1947, PASP, Box 57).
6 “I told him [SJM] I might come to England this summer since the Cretan
business seems out of the question for a long time, and he answered immediately
and said he wished I would, because he could use my help.” (AK to FD, 15
February 1948, PASP, Box 57).
“But I want to come [to Oxford] very badly, and I think will manage in some way.
Last time I wanted to see Minoan—this time I want to see people.” (AK to SJM, 15
February 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres Correspondence).
“I shall be sailing for England July 21, and have about three months work to finish
before I go. I have decided that the inscriptions must be classified according to
content before anything useful can be accomplished with them, and want to finish a
preliminary classification to show Sir John. It will not be the best that can be done,
but will be better than the rather careless arrangement of Evans, and if possible,
Myres will publish the classification numbers and Evans’ numbers, so that the rest
of you will be spared a year’s work in making the preliminary classification.” (AK

straight in my mind.” (AK to SJM, 23 October 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres

save trouble, I have sent direct to her a copy of this letter.[…] Thank you both for
your comments on the conventions for damaged signs &c. I agree with Dr. Kober
that signs should be normalized wherever possible […] I agree with Dr. Kober
about the need to indicate fully the condition of the tablet, but I would rather do the
whole thing graphically […] Finally, I enclose a rough draft of inscription 1, with
the above conventions, and from Dr. Kober’s suggestions.” (MV to SJM, Good

“I haven’t had much chance to talk to him [Myres], actually, because Lady Myres
keeps him in bed Mondays and Wednesdays, and when I do see him, it’s only for
an hour or so, and that time is full of Linear B, because I’m revising the
vocabulary, which is in perfect chaos because he has been able to work only at
irregular intervals, and then forgot about corrections which should have been
made.” (AK to FD, 24 August 1948, PASP, Box 57).
12 “I hope you won’t be angry if I send you a Christmas package. Our shortages
are annoying, but not acute. After all, it’s sound classical tradition to show your
love + respect for a teacher by useful gifts—and in these days, our greatest teachers
are often those we never meet except in a book, I do consider myself most
fortunate because I met you. Now when I read something you wrote, I sometimes
see your smiling at a secret joke. So forgive me because it gives me a selfish
pleasure to do something for you.” (AK to SJM, 21 October 1947, Ashmolean

13 “I realize from what you say that St. Hugh’s won’t be able to take me in when I
come (the date I read Mar. 7 is probably Mar. 17—a slight textual emendation). I’ll

Dictated, Typed, but not Sent:
Brooklyn College File
──
370
Alice Kober’s Brooklyn College (BCF) file has traveled with me for almost two years now. As it is printed on Letter size paper, it doesn’t fit in any
of my folders. I keep it in a plastic library bag. It was on my desk in Biel, in
Stuttgart, in London, in Berlin. I knew I would have to write about it, but I
dreaded doing so.
──
371
It was sent to me in December 2017, when I was in New York. I had inquired as to whether the Brooklyn College had a recording from the Menaechmi radio show. The librarian answered no, but (to comfort me?) she
photocopied the whole Kober file for me and mailed it to my then­home on
5th Street. When I looked through it, I found to my surprise that there were
many letters in there that hadn’t been in the Kober archive in Texas. Letters
to Professor Joseph Pearl, head of the Classics Department at Brooklyn College, through which I met a different Alice. Different to the one who corresponded with Franklin Daniel and Johannes Sundwall. She must have been
quite close to him, but nevertheless he was her superior and she had to be
diplomatic to get what she wanted (like time off from school to deliver papers at conferences). But as one letter shows (see p. 380), she wasn’t always
successful: she apologises for criticising him, for never thinking before talking. There are also file notes regarding conflicts, even a letter from fellow
professor Meyer Reinhold to Joseph Pearl who didn’t want to be put together with Alice on committee work because of the “strained atmosphere generated by Professor Kober’s presence” (Meyer Reinhold to Professor Pearl,
October 30, 1947).
──
372
Then there was another sheet of paper, empty apart from the typed line
“Report on Kober and Packer filed under Pope”.
I must have overlooked it the first time I went through all the documents
(a lot of correspondence regarding the substitutes for Alice while she was
sick, the sick leave in general, the financial side of her employment). When
I saw it this spring, spreading the material on my desk, I hesitated to write
again to the accommodating librarian. What would I receive? It could only
be another conflict, couldn’t it? The logic of my work seemed to invert itself, like a camera switched to auto mode, photographing an overly bright
scene. While Alice is painted negatively in the context of Ventris’ swine letter, it is agreed on that she was a good and dedicated teacher. This assessment is based on her committee work, on brailling the exams for blind students. Also, the letter from Mrs. Lawrence Green1
 is a testimony to her capabilities as a teacher. I do not doubt that she was a good teacher and that she
liked her job2
. But as a colleague, she seemed to have had the potential to be
arduous. I even asked myself if I should ignore the letter from Meyer Reinhold, or at least dismiss it as an uncooperative or nasty move, maybe
sparked by envy. In October 1947, Alice had just returned from her sabbatical, she was a Guggenheim fellow, maybe these facts alone were too much
for Mr. Reinhold and he couldn’t stand sitting at a table with her, being reminded that he wasn’t given that amount of recognition, even though their
paths were quite similar. Both parents had immigrated to the US from the
Austro­Hungarian Empire, he was three years younger than Alice and had
also done his PhD at Columbia, in Ancient History, soon becoming an expert on ancient Rome.
──
373
Maybe it was her eyes that always were a bit swollen and slightly empty,
gently carried in dark circles, orbits of unrest. Maybe he couldn’t stand seeing her looking at a paper or her notes, because the fact that she had to deal
with mundane questions kept her from having groundbreaking ideas. Kober’s presence made his and the others’ efforts trivial, regardless of the fact
that they, too, had their scholarly work, their ideas, their careers to pursue.
Maybe he, over the course of a committee meeting, could get so angry that
he had to excuse himself in the middle of a discussion that he had lost track
of, walk to the teacher’s restroom through the dim corridor smelling of faint
hope, stacked paper and a sharp cleaning agent. There, he’d stand in front of
the lavatory, shaking internally and not knowing what to do—he’d need to
remove something from in there, somewhere below the heart and above the
kidney, but how was he supposed to reach it?
──
374
Or was Alice really “temperamentally unsympathetic with democratic
procedures”? Did she really “sulk or sabotage the work when she finds herself in a minority position, or imagines that she is thus placed”? Did she
really “tend to regard criticism or rejection of her suggestions as personal
affronts”? Could it really be true that “her views were often so extravagant
that precious time was wasted”? Did Meyer Reinhold endure her attitude the
“many years” he was employed as teacher at Brooklyn College (since
1938), and use the security of his newly granted position as assistant professor (in 1947) to speak his mind?
──
375
I knew that Alice would have inquired about the report on Kober and
Pope, just because it was there. Not following a lead is an adulteration, she
doesn’t even have to tell me that, she just has to look at me from inside my
head with those eyes of hers, cradled in certainty. So I did. The light yellow
envelope was posted on July 23 2019 in Brooklyn, and waited for me when
I returned from London. It feels like a small number of pages, 4 or 6. It can’t
have been a big conflict, if it was solved in two or three letters. I feel the paper clip in the top left corner. I don’t dare to open it. I would rather go
through the file I have read so many times already once more. This time
there’s one particular letter from Pearl that seems of importance.
──
376
10 May 1945 ––––––––BCF
Joseph Pearl to Alice Kober
Dear Professor Kober:
Mindful of your vigorous protest against the use of the proportionate
share of your contribution to the departmental fund for the purchase of the
three books for the general good of the Department in connection with out
new course Classical Civilization 1, I am returning to our treasurer your
proportionate share amounting to 0.39$. The purpose of this note is to keep
the record clear.
I cannot even begin to imagine how I would write a scene in which an
internationally renowned researcher gets all worked up because of contributing 39 cents to the acquisition of three reference books. The letter from Professor Pearl was “dictated, typed, but not sent” as a note on the bottom of
the page clarifies. The reason for not sending it could lie in the fact that returning her share and writing a letter about it is almost as strange as Alice’s
protest in the first place. What can be gathered from the letters is that Alice
either annoyed Pearl, or a colleague who then asked Pearl to intervene.
There’s no further information on why Alice was opposed to buying the
books. Perhaps she wasn’t happy with the new Classical Civilization I
course or the person who taught it, or if she had issues with the books that
someone had requested. Given her generosity towards her correspondents,
especially Sundwall and Myres, to whom she would send packages full of
treats after the war, it seems unlikely that it was a question of money (also
the contribution to the departmental fund had already been made).
──
377
I imagine a conference room, with two big wooden tables in the middle.
They had been pushed together despite their slightly different height and the
fact that their edges were shaped in a way that created a fjord­like split on
either side. There are chairs, wooden with leather padding, there is carpet,
probably the colour of dried blood. Outside there’s early evening, outside
there’s hope that the war might soon end. The hope is kindled by fires, fierce
enough to melt stone. But this fatal amount of heat is far away from the conference room and nobody thinks of it now. There are ashtrays on the table
and brittle air from smoking. There’s a secretary, her slightly diffuse hair
pinned up with tortoise shell combs. Her habit of scratching her ear with the
pencil when she doesn’t have to write something down. There is the Classical Department’s body of teachers: soft bodies, especially around the middle.
Bodies in shirts and jackets, bodies in blouses and skirts. If I imagine Alice
sitting there, I can’t help to inscribe my memory of faculty meetings upon
her: sitting there and thinking of something else, this is how I had my best
ideas. There were many meetings to which I brought little tasks, work which
was not university­related or related to the meeting—tasks which I could
solve without writing a lot down, but just some words, pretending to
scribble. I wrote poems in faculty meetings. Why would she, who was always overloaded with work, spend her precious time following a petty discussion about which three books to buy?
But Alice was a professor, not an assistant: she could and probably
wanted to leave a mark by her way of doing her job. So she was probably
more interested in the details, she wanted her opinion to matter. No tasks to
distract herself from the slowness of other people’s thoughts, from their passion for discussing the most obvious things.

Maybe she is tired, maybe the chair’s backrest is pressing into her back
in a way that makes it hard to breathe. I cannot imagine her starting a fight
without being unwell in some sense. Or, the most likely solution, something
personal was going on. Not with chairman Pearl, but with whoever was
teaching Classical Civilizations I. If I have to write how Alice’s chest tightens up, how she ashes on the table or better: her papers while gesturing and
pointing to that body across from her, that body enfolded in checkered fabric
—pale blue and white—, if I have to write her rage and insistence, then
there must be displeasure of some sort. A conflict which is not spoken of
now, but which is major. Like: She had hoped to be teaching the course, but
somebody else got it easily, or with a lot of effort. Or: She had wanted to go
on sabbatical earlier (it was postponed because of the war, she says in a letter to Sundwall3
), but one of her colleagues complained or didn’t want to
support her and thus she had to stay. I’d even seed a sentence in that earlier,
actual event, the other person saying something like: “So yes, I can tip the
scales. And you can’t do a thing about it.” The other person being more than
one head taller, with a flimsy moustache. It would be easy to involve a
broken heart or dented ego in this, but I have a strong feeling that Alice was
too smart or busy to let something like that happen. Maybe this other person
had been appointed Associate Professor before her, after much less time
working at Brooklyn College4
. And Alice had complained, either officially
or in confidence and somehow they heard about it.
──
379
In a letter from March 3 1937 to Professor Pearl (BCF), Alice apologises
for not once being able to think first and then talk: “I must some day learn
not to say things first and then think them over later”. She has criticised
Pearl, she writes, without intent. The conversation must have been about
proctoring exams and she had refused to do it, because she had had to do it a
couple of months earlier—which ruined her plans for taking her mother on
vacation. “I realize now that you were quite right. Things being what they
are, I am the only one who is free and available at that time. When I spoke I
only remembered the entrance­exam. Proctoring I had to stay for at the beginning of the term prevented my mother from taking the vacation she
needed badly since Father died. I didn’t say anything then because the assignment was fair, and I shouldn’t have said anything to­day.”
I encountered this impulsive, somewhat careless side only in the Brooklyn College File. Maybe the late, frustrated letters to Myres are an echo of it,
too. But then there’s the pain taking over her body. In 1937 or 1945, there is
no known illness. There’s just a woman in her thirties who seems to deal
rather unflinchingly with things, unfazed by other people’s status or position. Maybe she was being a pain, maybe she knew it too. But she had her
opinions or arguments, and why not make the others hear them?
──
380
Now the backrest of the chair is slightly rounded and soft, and Alice
leans against it. She’s lighting a cigarette and she speaks without looking up.
She collects tobacco crumbs from the table with the tip of her right index
finger and carelessly throws them on the floor.
“Why can’t you buy the books yourself, like most of us do with our
salary?”
“As I said they should be at hand for the students to consult, not for me.
If I buy them, I would like to take them home at some point.”
“Well, you can take them home after the students have read them,
right?”
“I own those books already.”
“I think the library should buy them, then they have a proper place, not
just somewhere in that preparation room where literally anything is lost as
soon as one stops holding onto it.”
“The slides were found, Alice, and so was the model.”
“The fund is meant to subsidise activities or purchases that cannot be
covered by any other College fund. We’re still waiting for the shelf to be replaced and weren’t allowed to buy one from the fund. If it’s now possible to
do whatever we want with the money, then we should buy a shelf first.”
“I don’t need a shelf for my class. I need the books.”
“I can’t do a thing about it, can I?”
──
381
It’s not a question of power, but of connecting the dots, being consistent.
It is not even a discussion or argument. It’s a matter of respect: following
the rules and acknowledging how things have been done so far. I have
wondered a couple of times if Alice might have had some autistic traits. If I
imagine her in the conference room, going on and on about the three books
and the 39 cents, she has to ignore the uneasiness of those who aren’t taking
part in the discussion: looking at their hands or at someone else, in their
eyes, a train home or a sandwich from the deli. Shuffling, breathing, murmuring. Someone, most likely Pearl, trying to intervene. But she apparently
doesn’t care, or doesn’t grasp the resentment in the room.
──
382
To get out of that baleful conference room, I decide to open the report on
Kober and Pope. I cut it open carefully. Outside in the rain, two crows fighting over prey. What they try to snatch from each other looks like a rubber
band, but probably is something edible. They jump and fly away simultaneously, their doubled weight makes them land on the roof again. Their feathery persistence splayed proud against the light grey afternoon silence.
──
383
It takes me a long time to read Helen Pope’s letter—so many wings were
drawn to the characters that the words keep flying up, settling on another
line, just to flit away in the moment I find them.
──
384
On January 10 1943, Pope gives Professor Pearl her view of an “atrocious and absolutely unmerited attack” upon her by Miss Kober. On January
8, she had written to the College’s President Harry D. Gideonse about it and
now Pearl is in charge of sorting things out. She opens her statement to
Pearl with the assessment that she “should not be surprised if she [Kober] is
suffering from megalomania. […] Her ungovernable fits of rage, her insistence on rambling about herself at all times, her utter lack of affection or
consideration for others, seem to me pathological.”
In the letter to Gideonse, Helen Pope is less medical but even more denigrating: “I deeply regret troubling you with the following sordid story, but
it culminates a series of persecutions covering many years and appearing
this term in such unreasonable forms accompanied by such uncontrollable
rage that no amount of renunciation and tact on my part, I fear, will longer
protect me from even bodily harm.”
The story behind it is that Alice was responsible for the department’s
collection of slides and the projection equipment in room 2408, “the only
department room with dark shades” (letter from Alice Kober to Joseph Pearl
in January 1943, in which she gives him her view of the incident as asked
to) and that Helen Pope used this room with the Greek Club without reserving it properly in advance. She sent Alice’s class, who were supposed to
meet in 2408, away. When Alice walked by that room on her way to her office to get “chalk, my class cards and some other material I needed because
of the unexpected change in plans”, Helen Pope told her that Professor Pearl
had given her permission to use the room. Alice answered “in just about the
words she [Pope] quoted in her letter that this was not the first time that she
had done a thing of this kind, and that I considered her action unethical.”
Alice, in her statement points out that, yes, the procedure around the slides
and the projection room may not be practical, but couldn’t be avoided as
long as there were no duplicates and only one room in which the light could
be darkened—and that the department had accepted it in a vote.
──
385
“Then I turned and went to my office. She followed me, and while I was
unlocking the office door, began to insist that she was quite willing to give
up the room to me. […] I told her that I did not wish to discuss the matter
any further at that time. This is probably represented in her letter by the
words ‘I won’t talk’, which I am certain I did not use. I did not see any point
in any further discussion. I thought then, and I still think, that Professor
Pope was fully aware that she was in the wrong and that she understood my
position clearly. I did not feel justified in wasting any more class time on
what was, after all, a fairly trivial matter.”
Alice’s tone is factual and consolidated. She suggests that maybe for
Helen Pope, “the fact that she was my teacher when I was a Freshman at
Hunter College makes it a little hard for her to understand that I am no
longer a child, and cannot be expected to have the same attitude of respectful admiration for whatever she does. I see no reason why she should hate
me for it.”

I am the chalk you carry, I am the paper you put up, I am the darkness
soon to saturate the seminar room. I am the echo of your steps in the hall: a
slow staccato, headed straight to common sense.
──
387
I am yet another solution to write that scene, the grotesque quarrel about
buying those books. It has nothing to do with ego, with conflict, let alone
with love. Not even autism. I am a formality which isn’t a shell, but has soft,
checkered flesh. A spine even, nerves and capillary tubes.
Maybe you just liked to stick to the rules, maybe it’s as simple as that.
Rules not as hollow constraints, but as rooms to live in. And it would make
sense, wouldn’t it: your work being so methodical, so consistent, no matter
how complicated or exhausting the process to follow your methods might
have been? You did it because you had decided to do it. The motivation was
that it was necessary5
. You didn’t need anything else, no assertion or human
softness like gratitude or some other reward. The price was to know that you
carried things out the way they ought to be carried out. And thus you were
unquestionably a part of the system, the culture your parents had chosen for
you. A culture and a time of people arriving, staying, building futures and
hopes. Doing things the way they were supposed to be done, I’d like to imagine, meant on a level below the linoleum of everyday life, to belong, to
have roots.
──
388
I am sitting a couple of chairs to the right, next to the fjord. I can’t see
you from here, just your hands: your fingers are short, the skin is a bit dry.
You prick the tip of your pencil into your ball of the thumb, leave it for a
second or two, and when you pull it out there is a dot. It takes a moment until it is gone. You continue without looking or noticing. You let them talk
about their books and you know that you are very close to reminding them
of the regulatory framework regarding the department’s funding, and I think
they also know. That one teacher with the ill­fitting haircut is throwing
glances at you. Probably they thought at the beginning, when you joined
Brooklyn College, your strictness would pass. Like every other young
teacher, you’d lose that part of your passion in the first couple of years
which turn against you one way or another. But you didn’t. You didn’t lose,
you gained, because you felt that someone had to be an example. Somebody
had to care.
After all, you called Helen Pope an “unethical woman”—not unorganised or impolite or confused. Her lack of respect for procedure agreed on
was a moral misdoing, rocking the very ground on which the College was
supposed to stand. Not least undermining your responsibility and credibility.
It’s like boys with a stick: they laugh and poke and laugh and poke the side
of a cat until it gets mad and throws its claws lickety­split through the air.
Then, the boys try not to cry but in fact, inside, they do. Outside, there’s a
one­upmanship in hating the cat. That is what is happening around this table
right now, look, each one of them wants to be bold and pokes again, look at
them, look how they are prancing. I respect you deeply for being the thing
in fur that they are afraid of and thus dislike. I wouldn’t fight for the rules
like you did, I wouldn’t be willing to let them trigger my rage and determinedness. But I live in another time, in different circumstances. And I am not
strong in conflict either. You live in war time, a man’s time. Their own
words are the only thing you have at hand to rebuke them with.
──
389
And I think I sense this same admiration in the secretary who turns the
pages of her notebook as if she was shutting a door in a stranger’s apartment. She might not agree with you on the specifics, but in general she does
see your point, gleefully.
──
390
Helen Pope, as a matter of fact, is not a man or a boy nor did she try to
poke. But, let’s be honest, reading the second letter enclosed in the envelope, she seems to suffer from persecutional mania or some other psychosis.
She mentions the FBI and a thing with her car in the first letter, the one to
president Gideonse, and that she hadn’t reported you but a German man, and
thought you’d hate her because you thought she might have reported you.
You write you have never even seen her car and don’t know at all to what
she might be alluding. In the second letter, Pope goes totally astray after announcing that she wanted to write about departmental problems: Policemen
appear in unrecognisable formations, they ask questions about an accident
and the car and then the letter is over without clarifying anything. Even
though her accusations are similar to those made by Meyer Reinhard, it
seems that she was very confused or in a bad place. She deforms your cloying dutifulness into a threat of aggression which surely is unfounded. Hardcore discussions, yes. Bodily harm, no way.
Pearl concludes his investigation with the recommendation to Gideonse
to not take further steps, as the talks he had with both women involved
seemed to have brought them closer together. That’s the end of it, no more
complaints or letters about her or you. You, the cat that pokes back.6

1 “I was just one of that lucky group of Latin students who, during less
troublesome times some six or seven years ago, enjoyed Horace and Plautus and
Terence under your capable guidance in the evening sessions at Brooklyn College.
I wanted you to know how much it meant to me when you carried us through so
that we had sufficient credit to consider Latin our major—despite the fact that you
no longer wanted to teach at night. I hope this letter reaches you because I do want
you to know, even at this late date, that I was one student who never believed or
considered that Latin was ‘not practical’ and that whatever love and understanding
I have for the classics, I attribute for the most part to you.” (letter from Mrs.
Lawrence Green to AK, quoted in her Guggenheim application CV in the section
‘letters’, PASP, Box 56.6).
2 “Now [during the sabbatical] I am devoting fourteen hours a day to Minoan,
enjoying the beautiful autumn weather. I hate to admit it, but I’m beginning to miss
College already.” (AK to Joseph Pearl, 19 September 1946, Brooklyn College
File).
“Es muss ja ganz wunderbar sein, wenn das Lehren endlich um ist, und man kann
sich sagen dass man nur zu Lernen hat. Ich habe ein Jahr gehabt, und, obwohl ich
viel Freude von meine Stunden als Lehrerin habe, ist es doch viel schöner nur
meine eigene Arbeit zu corrigieren.” (AK to JS, 3 June 1947, PASP, Box 58)
“It must be wonderful when teaching is finally over and one can say that all that is
left is learning. I had one year and even though the students bring me a lot of joy, it
is a lot nicer to be correcting just my own work.).
“Here at Brooklyn College there is no connection between my scholarly work and
my teaching. We’re beginning to teach only literature in translation—and to me this
is anathema. I get so tired of pointing out that Gilbert Murray isn’t Euripides, and
that Catullus is a good poet, even if the translations are—and I’m being charitable
—second rate.” (AK to SJM, 30 January 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres
Correspondence).
“I’ve been home [back from Oxford] almost a month now, and haven’t done as
much as I could do in a couple of days of uninterrupted work. It is annoying to
have to stop what I am doing at 11 at night, often right in the middle of something,
get ready for bed so that I can get up for school in time, then find that committee
meetings, and unexpected visitors, keep me from continuing for a couple of days.”
(AK to SJM, 14 October 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres Correspondence).
3 “I do not want to make a mystery of my trip, especially to you, I wrote that I was
on leave this year from Brooklyn College. This was a sabbatical leave, postponed
because of the war. In addition, however, the Guggenheim Foundation, which gives
grants for scholarly research, gave me a Fellowship for studying the Minoan
inscriptions, with the understanding that I would write to Blegen for permission to
examine the Pylos material, and Myres for that from Knossos.” (AK to JS, 25
February 1947, PASP, Box 58).
4 After being an instructor at Brooklyn College from 1930­1935, Alice Kober was
appointed Assistant Professor in 1936 (see Guggenheim application CV). In a letter
──
392
to Franklin Daniel, discussing her financial situation at the college in comparison
to the professorship at Penn, she says she is doing well for a woman and that her
promotion to Associate Professor is overdue (AK to FD, 22 September 1947, PASP,
Box 57). It finally was approved by the Board of Higher Education on 23 January
1950 (see letter from Secretary Carrie K Medalie to AK, 24 January 1950,
Brooklyn College File).
In the same file there are also two forms indicating that the department had
recommended Alice’s promotion in September 1947, effective on 1 January 1949,
and in September 1948, effective on 1 January 1950.
Based on a letter from the President of the College, Harry D. Gideonse, in
November 1945, Alice Kober must have raised the matter of her promotion to him
in 1945: “I have followed for some years the principle that the President does not
see members of the Faculty on promotion matters when the Faculty committees
and sub­committees are engaged with the same subject matter. An alternative
policy would simply lead to a great confusion of functions.” (Harry Gideonse to
AK, 8 November 1945, PASP, Box 58).
5 “This is taking the long way to a solution, but since forty years of short­cuts
hasn’t produced very much, I think perhaps ten more years of doing it the hard way
may be better.” (AK to SJM, 30 January 1948, Ashmolean Museum, Myres
Correspondence).
6 Alice Kober mentions Helen Pope two years later to Johannes Sundwall—
apparently it had been her who had put Sundwall and Kober in touch—so she
hadn’t retired and interaction and maybe even friendliness was possible between
the two women: “To­day I saw Mrs. Pope, who is, as I think you know, one of my
colleagues, and thanked her for sending you my address. I do not think I would
ever have had the courage to write you otherwise.” (AK to JS, 22 September 1947,
PASP, Box 58).

The Most Unusual Student I Ever Knew:
David McClymont
──
394
***
She swallowed a moan and kept walking. The pain made her heart
beat faster. How could such a sharp stone happen to be in her shoe now,
after almost eight hours at the school? It was too late in the summer for
bees. Alice shifted her weight a little. There it was again, this time the
pain was inaudible, its pastel pink swashing through Alice’s leg and
torso. Only a couple of more steps and she could sit down on the bench
next to the entrance and fumble the malicious shiver out.
“I was hoping to see you,” a young man said, not in school uniform,
holding the door for Alice. “Are you alright?”
Alice knew him, but from a long time ago, longer than she could have
ascertained. Their eyes met across the Atlantic Ocean, no wind, no
waves.
“David,” she said, “Mister McClymont.”
He put his arms around her like a child, except that he was almost
two heads taller than her, but when Alice’s face, her whole body soft and
unprepared for gravity, touched his chest he stepped back again. Maybe
it hadn’t been an embrace, maybe he had caught her from tripping,
maybe the pain had made her faint for a split second.
“I’m sorry,” David said, “I was going to drop a note for you, Miss
Kober.” Like he had done as a student in the breaks between classes with
apples and pencils or pieces of chalk, he’d present an envelope plucked
out of the air. If she had said something, it would have been the sentence
that she had carried around in the hollow of her mouth for almost four
──
395
years: I cannot imagine having a child, but I can imagine losing one. This
is what I’ve learnt from war.
“Excuse me…,” Alice said1
, limping to the bench next to the steps and
sitting down—the pain bright red now, raging in her body like lava—untying her laces, taking off her shoe, feeling the breeze through the stockings, seeing her toes as a solid slab of extremity through the nylon. She
shook the stone out of her shoe, almost disappointed at its size, then
breathing.
“I am very glad you returned safely,” Alice said, “you look well.”
David knew she was being nice, he looked better than many others,
maybe, but not well. Even his mother had only recognised him after a
second. Which made him, in return, not recognise her too—after all, he
had never seen the face she has for strangers before. After three days,
she still was touching his cheeks, his arms, his back, whenever he or she
was around, checking the ripeness of her body’s fruit. Sure, he had lost
weight, sure, his hair was almost shaved off, sure, he had grown older.
But he had no scars, no crutches, no loss of tissue or bone. You just need
to eat a little, son, she said and blew her nose. Sometimes, it was almost
impossible to believe that home was a place that had once existed.
“I came to see if I’d recognise my own old life,” he said, pointing
vaguely at the school. It is his voice, thought Alice, hoarse and cracking,
as if he had just stopped screaming for a very long time.
“Good thing nothing ever changes around here. Just the paper got
thinner and thinner.”
“I know,” David looked at the envelope “it doesn’t take a magician
anymore to make it disappear.”

6 October 1945 –––––––PASP
Alice Kober to Mary Swindler
I wonder if, offhand, you would know the name of a good university
which offers graduate work in numismatics. A really remarkable young
man, without question the most unusual student I ever knew, has just been
discharged from the army after four years of service, almost three of them
overseas in active combat. Even as a freshman he was interested in numismatics, and his greatest ambition in life was to join the staff of some museum. He has come back, as some of the best of them do, convinced that his
years of fighting have made it impossible for him to go ahead with the academic career he planned. I have tried to convince him that he should take
advantage of the GI Bill of Rights, but since I know very little about numismatics, I could not make any specific suggestions. He really deserves every
consideration, not for any sentimental reasons, as a veteran, but because he
has a remarkable mind, and a tireless enthusiasm for his subject. I would be
very grateful if you could tell me if there is any way he could prepare himself for the work he loves, or, conversely, if there are no openings in his
chosen field, or—at any rate, how to go about finding out.
──

“You cannot have a student work for you. Not here. In our house.”
“David is a former student, Muttchen.” And it is my house, Alice said
without any actual words, just by placing her hands flat on the polished
walnut table looking out of the window. The Ericsons’2
 little boy had
started to balance rocks again. Katharina set her teacup down, also
without any actual words.
“It’s the right thing to do,” Alice said, “just as simple as that.”
“You know the neighbours. There will be stories.”
“Finally a story about me that involves a man, I thought everybody
would enjoy this.”
Katharina got up so quickly from the table that her chair almost
tipped over, just standing there, without anything to carry into the kitchen or back, her hands in mid air.
“I’m sorry, Muttchen. I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“You never mean to upset, but you do. You cannot always make the
world to your liking. And even if you could, you would still cause unnecessary trouble for yourself by inviting a young man to your house. You
don’t know what he thinks you are offering.”
“A job, Muttchen. I am offering a very modest part time job to a
brave man who has fought for our country and now can’t find a position
he’s suited for. A job that I’d have to do myself otherwise.” Alice poured
herself and her mother another cup of tea. The fight was over. Katharina
never said anything more than once. And even that only if it was unavoidable. Before Ferrie died, he had reasoned with the children. He had
──
398
never felt that they knew the world better than their parents. He wasn’t
ashamed of his English. He wasn’t ashamed of not knowing all the things
they learned in their long school days. Before Ferrie died, it was almost
never inevitable to say all that has to be said, all those angular words
that made Katharina’s ears ring.
Alice looked at her mother, her blouse with the little flowers that
keep repeating themselves in an asymmetrical pattern, and involuntarily
smiled when she tried to imagine offering herself to David. All her mind
could come up with was the two of them in the classroom, Alice’s fingers
warm and slightly stiff, coated in chalk. There’s a table, and herself and
David are standing on either side. They talk and his eyes have their lissomeness from before the war, and he plucks a coin from the nothingness in between them.
“You could at least ask Willy to be here, too,” said Katharina with almost no voice. She pulled the chair towards her and sat down, wood
creaking. She had the feeling that her hands shook, but she kept them
under the table and didn’t check. Just like when she was a child, trying to
hide from the parents the red streaks the teacher’s ruler had left for
whatever wrongdoing of that day.
“I’m sorry, Muttchen,” said Alice, “I really am, but there’s no other
option here. I can’t do the work in the college and this is the only other
space available. You’ll like him, he is polite and his voice is soft.” Katharina nodded. Outside, the Ericsons’ boy stretched his chubby left arm, his
spine, he balanced on his toes to place a rock on the stack almost a head
higher than him.
──
399
***
“Don’t you think it will be a bit strange to have student work for you,
Aliceliebes? Here. In our house.”
“Because of what the neighbours might think, or because it is strange
to help out a good man who has fought for our country?”
“You know what I mean.” Katharina stirred her tea, rotating the
spoon itself as well, but in the opposite direction. A silver satellite in the
orbit of a brass-coloured universe.
“No, quite honestly, I don’t know what you mean, it’s nothing you or
anybody else has to worry about.” There is this bond between a mother
and a daughter which, to Alice, is a translucent string of rubber. A type
of resilience which Alice used to find reassuring. Then, she had had a
dream one night after they had visited aunt Anna and her daughters:
Alice was to give birth but somehow couldn’t, and in the end someone
(her mother? her aunt? the sea?) had to tear the half-stuck infant out of
her womb, but it wasn’t so much a child as a jellyfish with confusing
tentacles still attached to Alice’s middle. When she woke up, like having
been hit with a flashlight, she felt how the thing had been dangling
between her inner thighs before her mother? her aunt? the sea? had
come to her aid. Then, like someone adjusting the radio for a crisper signal, the feeling switched to the salty pain of those female line’s hands
wrenching at her. It got weaker, but never really left. Probably that is
true for most feelings, Alice thought, the gentle ones and the regrettable
ones. The bond between herself and her mother was always on the
stretchy side, so that Alice had to lean the opposite way in order to stay
──

where she was. Therefore Katharina had to lean, too, and the incline prevented the whole arrangement from collapsing.
“I know what you’re afraid of. But let me assure you, David isn’t interested in women of any kind. So you will be safe with him around,
too.” Alice knew it was childish, but she enjoyed mildly shocking her
mother, making her inhale sharply through her teeth, then to hold her
breath and hope for a misunderstanding.
“I spend my whole life with these young people,” said Alice, “and I
have plenty of time to observe them, whether I intend to or not. And, believe me, while David is sweet and confident with me, it’s too much for
him to hold a sheet of paper when a certain Mister is in the room. His
ears burn up.”
“Is that so?” said Katharina and finally put the spoon down. She took
a sip and tried not to cough. Sweet and confident. Maybe, she thought, it
wasn’t a bad idea after all, that young man coming over. Maybe if Alice
got used to someone sweet and confident it could only help, the desire to
be with someone, to enjoy the advantages of matrimony. Katharina defended her daughter’s life choices prompted by a university career
against any criticism, but as deep as this respect was her trust in
nature’s habit of joining the female kind with the male to make a whole.
So when someone, which had happened more frequently lately, implied
that Alice might not like men at all, Katharina made up a story. Now she
could tell the one of the young, sweet and upright young man who, despite Alice’s assertions he wasn’t interested in her, adored her in the most
affectionate, abiding way. The whole business of Alice employing him
simply would slip Katharina’s mind.
“Yes, it is,” said Alice.

Alice Kober to Franklin Daniel
Incidentally, since you are connected with a museum I have a request to
make. If you should hear of any opening for a young man (I know they’re
scarcer than hen’s teeth) I have a candidate, a former student of mine, now
about 26, and a veteran. He was an expert on numismatics even while he
was still in college—he taught me all I know about Greek and Roman coins.
He really would be an extremely useful person in a museum. He is extremely
accurate and careful, letters beautifully, has a genius for classification, can
work with French, German and Spanish, Latin, and Greek and Hebrew inscriptions. At the moment he is helping me with the preliminary classification of Lydian, Lycian and Carian. He just has to be shown how to do something once, and then can be trusted to work on his own. He was taken by the
army as soon as he got out of college, so he has no institutional experience.
He has done some classification of coins and other ancient objects for
private collectors in New York. If by any chance you should know of any
museum work anywhere, he would, I sincerely think, be a find. I know his
work best in ancient archeology and epigraphy, but his coins have made
him familiar with more modern things as well. His name and address:
David J. McClymont
569 Tenth St.
Brooklyn 15, N.Y.
Please don’t think I go about making a pest of myself for students. He is
the only one I have ever tried to get a job for, and that is because he really
deserves it.

It was a strange thing: Whenever David was there, working at the living room table, Alice’s body had a strong desire to get up from her chair,
to walk out of the room to the kitchen or the backyard and to do something there. Mostly she decided to smoke, because it seemed the most
natural thing to do, but it could have been something completely else—
tending to the dahlias3
 that had been weighed down during the afternoon’s rain, looking at the Ericsons’ boy, trying to befriend an overly
venturous squirrel, examining her mother’s latest and already abandoned garden project, which involved a couple of feet of chicken wire.
Alice’s unfamiliar urge to move wasn’t a sign of nervousness, as a casual
bystander might have assumed, smoothing over confusion caused by the
former soldier, student, and calligrapher and quiet classifications worker, who would accept one cup of coffee and nothing else, no matter how
much he was pressured. It was more of a warm relief that the work was
being taken care of and didn’t depend on Alice’s attention and her presence, which let her stroll like a child who had thrown their kite in the
sky, with fullest belief in the blueness and the string. Sometimes even
the front porch was Alice’s sky: she sat on the steps and saw David’s
back, slightly rounded from bending over the table. She tried to imagine
her own back in the cinnamon-coloured cardigan over there, but she
couldn’t make herself appear on the other side of the window. It was him
there and her here, under a ray of sunlight, calm and content. Only when
David looked up and turned his head, as if he was looking for her, did she
feel bad for abandoning him. She also felt bad for paying him so little, for
──

never being able to do it without the awkwardness that is so characteristic of all monetary affairs. The bills waited on the desk when he arrived
and the question “have you seen the envelope?” was Alice’s way of saying that for the afternoon, time was up.
“Yes, I did,” he would say continuing with what he was doing, eventually stating that he didn’t have anything better to do anyway—sitting
at home and being informed by his younger sisters about which Hollywood actor or actress had said or done this, or that it wasn’t exactly
what he hoped life had prepared for him.
“The world just needs time to rearrange itself,” Alice said.
“But if history teaches us one thing, it’s that time is not what humankind needs to refrain from desolation,” muttered David. Some days, all
the knowledge about the Greeks and the Roman Empire and everything
from the past tilted over to smother his bones, unimaginably white amid
all the tenacious substance. What difference was there in knowing that
everything had been there already?Why dig it up, why put it in a display
case, why learn it by heart? Maybe the way of the world could only be
changed if there were bones in the heart, bones that could be buried and
eventually washed up, bones as proof that for millennia, this was what
kept matters on earth ticking over: the heart. It is even in the letters,
thought David: earth and heart, why doesn’t everyone else see this?
“You will find a position that suits your skills. Maybe Franklin Daniel
of the University Museum at Penn knows of something.” Alice put her
hand on David’s shoulder and withdrew it when she realised that it wasn’t finding her mother’s softness covered in knitted wool, but a sharp
tenseness, covered in shirt cotton.
“Maybe. Thank you again for writing on my behalf, you didn’t have
to do that.” As if David didn’t know who Franklin Daniel was, given that
there was always at least one of his letters waiting for Alice’s reply.
──
404
“I wish I could do more,” said Alice, offering David a cigarette. He
took one, threw it in the air and caught it with his mouth. Alice laughed,
as he had hoped she might.
“If the worst comes to the worst, I’ll put up a show to earn a living.”

Alice Kober to Johannes Sundwall
Die schöne Überschrift hat einer meiner früheren Studenten geschrieben. Er ist ein eifriger Numismatiker und für ihn ist der Name Sundwall mit attischen Münzen fest verbunden. Er kam zufallsweise auf Besuch,
als ich die Adresse schrieb, und bat um die Ehre, sie zu schreiben.
(The beautiful title was printed by a former student of mine. He is a keen
numismatist and for him the name Sundwall is firmly tied to Attic coins. He
happened to visit me when I was about to write the address and asked for
the honour of printing it.)

***
Now that her bed was empty, David remembered how much it had
puzzled him to see the sitting room turned into a bedroom. Her bed had
remained upstairs of course, but the couch was covered with pastel-coloured linen and a duvet. The eggshell finish nightstand in the corner
between window and wall, holding a glass of water, pill bottles, boxes,
books and letters was nothing short of an obscenity. It was as if Alice was
exposed from the inside, as if the line along which they had cut her open
half a year ago, had suddenly sprung open. Where mastered decency had
been, nothing was left but a gash.
She had been frail when she returned from the hospital, but she was
always properly dressed, waiting for him downstairs when he came to
work. She had to recover from the cure, in her words.4
 David wasn’t sure
if she was aware that the x-rays had absorbed all the colour from her
face. Even her clothes seemed faded, but David knew that was impossible. She would sit at the far side of the desk and work more or less
silently on correcting the manuscripts Myres had sent her. Bursting out
from time to time about unforgivable mistakes, pointing them out to
David, waiting for his consent, then holding her breath for a while. Her
mother made tea like she used to, but now she didn’t only put it on the
side board, but also poured it out. Katharina Kober looked more like a
mother to David now, strangely enough like a young mother, with eyes
ready to check on her toddler, wobbling along.
──
407
The bed in the sitting room was a confession of evanescent energy—
probably also of Katharina Kober’s, who must have assisted her all these
months more than David had first assumed.
“I just can’t walk upstairs,” said Alice, “right now.” Her hands fell
into her lap, her palms turned up. Her eyes wandered through the room.
Maybe even into the kitchen, where her toiletries stood on the shelf that
used to hold the good tea set some distant relative had sent over from
Hungary for Willy’s birth. Whenever there had been an occasion worthy
of the good tea set, either no one thought of it or Katharina didn’t have
time between the excitement and final preparations to get rid of the oily
dust which covered all the pieces. She did clean it before putting it away,
looking at the hut in the woods that was painted inside a golden frame.
Katharina could smell the woods outside Prague where they had collected the seasons: wild garlic, blueberries, mushrooms, and fire wood. She
longed, for a moment, to be at home, for Ferry to be alive, Alice to be
healthy and sturdy and William to be little. She longed, for a moment, to
smash that stupid little cup that didn’t know anything, but she simply
didn’t have the heart to do it.
“I don’t want her to get up,” said Katharina Kober with a hard voice
and thicker-than-usual German accent. In fact, it sounded more German
than English.
“Yes, ma’am,” said David guiltily in the entrance, his jacket in his
hand. “And I don’t want her to read the letters, it makes her upset.”
“Please, Muttchen, don’t talk about me like that, I can hear you, you
know?”
“She is very weak.”5
 This time Katharina Kober whispered and hid
her sentence with the rustling of her bags. “I will be back in an hour,”
she said, back at regular volume again. Then she gently squeezed David’s
──
408
forearm, and he had no idea what that meant. But before he could ask or
read her face, she walked out of the door.
“She won’t leave me alone,” explained Alice, wrapped in a crocheted
blanket, sitting on the recliner. David sat on his usual chair by the table.
The last couple of afternoons had been pure visits and no work, which
couldn’t keep Alice from putting out the envelope and forcing David to
take it. She didn’t care that she insulted him with the money. She
wanted things to be as they had once been. Paying him meant she was
employing him, which meant she was doing her work. It didn’t matter
that none of that was true. In fact, it wasn’t even clear whether or not
the college would find a way to keep paying her salary, as she had been
on sick leave for so long.6
 David contemplated putting the envelope in
the letterbox after having left the house, but he was afraid Alice would
find it there and feel not only sick, but disrespected. So he took the envelope (and those to come) with him, stacking them on the window sill
in his room. He could give them back to her when she was well again. Or,
if she wouldn’t accept them, buy her one of these household-sized paper
cutting machines he’d seen in the printing shop down the street.
“You know, when there was a fair in Prague, the women would go to
the gypsy caravans and have their palms read. They didn’t believe in
what they were told, after all it was just some gypsy gibberish, but still
they had to hear it. And over the years they all became experts in future
matters and they could feel and see things, too. Don’t believe a word,
David, especially not those she was whispering. Would you hand me the
stick, please?” She pointed at the walking stick which hung from the
doorknob. David’s head turned to the window facing the street, but, of
course, her mother was gone. He looked at Alice, at how small she was.
He didn’t beg her to rest, to stay in that dowdy blanket for as long as she
needed to recover, because he didn’t want to embarrass her and because
he knew that no order ever goes away by begging.
──
409
David would later rewind this scene, her voice, her words and play
them over and over again. But he couldn’t see her face, couldn’t recall if
her eyes had a conspiring glare or if there had been a laugh in some far
corner of her voice. She played a trick on him and it was so good that he
envied her.
When he was helping Katharina to sort out her things, to decide what
should go to the centre and what shouldn’t he was shaking and she told
him all the family moments she could remember. In the beginning, the
stories were sparked by letters she read, books she found, or some other
little object (she knew where every stone on Alice’s desk had come from
—or she was as good a cheat as her daughter), but after a while she just
sat there, never in Alice’s chair or recliner, her eyes half closed and
talked. One day it was mostly about Prague, and even though David knew
that the conversation didn’t need any comment or question from him,
he suddenly needed to know if Katharina really had foreseen Alice’s
death, if all the talk about recovery, about being better in two, three
weeks or months had been merely a charade to keep her in good spirits.
And if yes: why? Why not tell her the truth, the only thing she was ever
interested in? Literally, the only thing Alice was dying to find. David
knew that she would have wanted to stack the material herself. Probably
she would have made an inventory or written instructions for the material to be used, how and by whom. She would have wanted to know.
“Had Alice ever been to one of those gypsy fairs?” he asked at a point
of Katharina’s story that seemed about right. She followed her own
thought for a couple more sentences, then she returned to David’s question like a missed a turn.
“What gypsies?”
“Those fairs in Prague where the gypsies read palms.”
──
410
Katharina looked at him with bewilderment. “I might be an old woman from the old world, but I do not believe in any mumbo-jumbo whatsoever.”
David tried to explain, but just caused more and more confusion. He
wanted to drop the topic, just return to the monologue, but he had Katharina confused so thoroughly that he wasn’t sure if her head was alright.
She had to handle a lot, and she was indeed an old woman from the old
world: maybe she just needed a rest. Only when he was on his way home
that night did it occur to him that Alice had made up the whole story to
undermine her mother. He stopped and for the first time in weeks he felt
like standing up tall.
──
411
Look, Alice, I found him for you. I guess you’d like to know that he
managed to find a position in a museum. A museum of money, which seems
about the perfect match for a numismatist. The picture itself is quite silly, I
agree. But apparently marketing is everything. I wonder how the motif was
agreed upon. Was it a given that the curator would be photographed for the
article? And then David was clowning about while the photographer got
ready, and he suggested doing the same thing on the actual picture? It doesn’t matter, I know, but that’s how I look at all the original material, I can’t
help it. Trying to find a hint, even though I don’t need a hint in this case, as
nobody except me knows the link between you and this balding guy hiding
behind a fan of bills. Anyway I couldn’t stop searching for David McClymont for a couple of days, just because I know you cared so much about
him, I needed to make sure he was alright.

“I’m not up yet.” When would they finally accept that he didn’t have
a job that required him to get up, and thus could just as well sleep in the
mornings. And didn’t his sister, whose soft hand had just stopped touching his door, have her own life to put in order, like, finding a husband
and not just talking about finding one?
“David, it’s the newspaper,” said Clara, “I think it’s something about
those signs your former professor worked on. I thought you might want
to know about it right away.”
“About what?” David’s life had become a narrow bridge without
handrail. And despite the danger, his mother and Clara kept pushing
past him, many times a day, for no apparent reason. David looked at the
ceiling.
“I think it’s BEEN deciphered.”
“You think it has, or it has been deciphered?” David was already out
of bed, putting on pants and a pullover over his pyjamas. What was
wrong with these young girls, why couldn’t they be precise just for once?
David opened the door. Clara presented him with a newspaper like with
a relic, placed on both her hands, palms turned up.
“A guy from England did it,” she said.
“British Architect, in His Leisure Time Solves the Script Riddle and
Shows That Early Greeks Had Ability to Write7
,” David read, and the tablet depicted at the top of the article looked like a knife’s blade.
“That’s impossible,” he said, taking the newspaper from Clara’s
hands.
──
415
He read and reread the article several times. Alice wasn’t mentioned,
not one single word about her articles or her achievements. Why would
they omit this information? After all, she had been a New York resident
and this was the New York Times, for god’s sake.
“She’s not mentioned once,” David said, throwing the newspaper on
the kitchen table with enough momentum to make it slide right to the
floor. “Has everybody lost their sense of decency? Why wouldn’t they
show respect for her work?”
Clara shook her head. Of course she had no answer, she was the
young one. The girl.
“Do you want a coffee?” she asked, but David was already putting on
his boots and his jacket. He combed his hair in the hall mirror, using the
soft brush that hung from a little string on a silver hook, ready to hand
for dusting off coats. Clara thought she should have waited with the
news, maybe she should have hidden the paper, but with David it was
hard to know what pleased him and what upset him. All those moods.
His dark carapace, as their mother said when he wasn’t in the room.
Clara closed the door, which bounced open after David had slammed it
shut.
“Sir, you sure you want to buy all of today’s Times?” The man at the
kiosk looked at David with eyes that seemed to be remote-controlled
from a force hidden to the spectator.
“Yes,” David said.
“There’re still stacks of ‘em left, Sir.”
“Actually, could you do me a favour and put these copies here away?”
“But if they ain’t there, nobody’s going to ask for the Times. It’s like
with dogs. They forget what they don’t see.”
“It’s just. Well. Forget it.”
“You’re not buying anything? Sir?”
──
416
David had to turn away in order not to sob. Alice was dead. Even
though he had known that there was no way she still could have solved
the problem, this was irreversible. Now, all her work, all her time was
rendered obsolete. With this article, Alice Kober had vanished once and
for all. This Ventris guy had done it in his spare time. What about her
spare time? What about all those years of working on the deciphering
after work? David imagined this Ventris guy’s face, probably round and
glossy with joy. David imagined driving the tablet right into his fastidious heart. To hell with him. It should have been Alice. He wiped his face
dry with his sleeve as he stood in front of her house. There was light on
in the kitchen, but he didn’t see Katharina or Willy. What did he want to
tell them? If they hadn’t seen it yet, all the better for them. But probably
there would be some neighbours or relatives or whoever who would remember and cut it out for them. Killing Alice once again. David went up
the stairs, then didn’t knock. He noticed that the sun was shining, inappropriately bright. In the grass which marked the passage to the plot
next door were tiny purple flowers.
Would she be happy? That, after all, there was a solution? He remembered a passage from her letters in which she wrote that she’d continue her work until someone figured it out. But she had been too modest all her life. She was interested in the knowledge on a superordinate
level, as if it didn’t have anything to do with power, with career, with
fame. The fame that this Brit had taken from her now. David imagined
him sitting over breakfast, the newspaper folded on the side, eating eggs
or sausages, pretending that it was a morning like any other. David hit
the wooden pole with his hand a couple of times. It hurt and he could
breathe again. All those people at all their breakfast tables didn’t know
the truth.
“Mister McClymont,” Katharina said. “I didn’t expect you.”
──
417
“Miss Kober, forgive me, I also didn’t expect to be here.” David’s
knuckles started to bleed reluctantly. “I was…”
“You want tea?” Katharina asked, holding the door open for him.
“I don’t want to be a burden,” David said.
“Nonsense,” said Katharina.
Now that he was there he couldn’t pretend not to have seen the article. After Katharina had poured him a cup, he inched the newspaper towards her with the good hand. She read it motionlessly, didn’t say a
word, just pushed it back to him.
“I always picture her in England,” Katharina said. “Do you remember
how happy she was there?” David nodded. “Sometimes I think that I
have to do this or that before her return. Washing her sheets. Getting
sweets. Cleaning her window. I don’t tell Willy. I don’t tell anybody.
Maybe she had helped this man. In some way.”
Then there was a thick silence, like a rope, twining around their
memories. Outside the sun was still unaware that a parting was taking
place. This time it was final.

this.” (AK to Joseph Pearl, 17 January 1949, Brooklyn College File) What Pearl
did that Alice Kober is so grateful about is not explicitly mentioned, probably it has
to do with arranging her (paid) sick leave or the letter is dated incorrectly and it is
regarding her promotion, of which she was informed by a letter from the secretary
on 13 January 1950 (see Brooklyn College File).
“I cannot really say what I mean. But I thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

six weeks and just returned home a week ago. I am now on sick leave. I managed
to acquire something very unusual, and it took the doctors more than a month to
find out what it was—and then they were stumped about a cure. I think I am now
on the road to recovery. I hope so. I am not bed­ridden, but am at present housebound, because 10 weeks in hospitals in the last 12 have weakened my legs so that
I cannot manage the stairs. But enough about that.” (AK to SJM, 7 November

have to take sick leave till September. My doctors are not too encouraging about an

Conclusion
The journey to you, Alice, was, more than I ever would have thought, a
journey to myself. A journey to becoming the woman and the female author
I want to be. Sometimes I think: the author you wanted me to become. The
habit of addressing my thoughts to you, of seeing and judging them the way
that I assume you would have seen and judged them, brought an internal
voice into existence that is not yours but also not entirely my own. This in­
­between voice sometimes gently encourages and sometimes vehemently
pushes me: who knows how much time I have left to do the work I need to
do? How much more comfortable is my situation than yours? What is my
equivalent of the decipherment? Where do I want to be or to arrive? The
voice questioned me and, at times, this process was deeply unsettling. But
trying to find answers made me discover a voice that I hadn’t known before,
a voice that was unfamiliar and yet mine.
 The research planted words and ideas, some of which have already been
written and realised, though most of them have not. Even though I’m writing a text titled “Conclusion”, on a page with a number much greater than
the page count of the books I have written so far, it doesn’t feel like this is
an ending at all. It is, and I think you’d support this assessment, a beginning.
It’s the beginning of thinking about how I want to tell your story in a book,
for a wider audience. In our mother tongue. With gentle ink.

I am also hoping to write an article for an archaeological audience about
the Ventris incident in Oxford. Because this scrap of new knowledge that
turned up in between the archives and my writing, unexpected and shiny, is
an important piece of evidence for the both of us. For you, because you deserve to be known as the warm and helpful person you were (at least at
times). For me because it proves my intuition and my methodology were
right: there is knowledge that can be found in writing and fabulating only.
The journey to you was a journey to other people too. I’ve talked about
your life a lot in these last couple of years, and it always seemed to resonate.
A dancer from the Netherlands who is involved with native Mexican dance
asked me if I was channelling you—contacting your ghost or the ghostly
you, to get all the answers I needed, or to be with you. I started to laugh, but
he was dead serious (not­so­dead, in fact). I guess you would have laughed
at this kind of suggestion, too.
Would you have liked the historic crime novel writer who was, after I
told him the story of your life and how Ventris continued your work, quite
convinced that you didn’t die of cancer, but that Ventris killed you (to prevent you from figuring it out first)? That would cast a wholly different light
on the alleged Oxford meeting, wouldn’t it? It was quite fascinating to see
how differently and instantly my interlocutors appropriated your story and
made it theirs. It reminded me each time of how important it is to challenge
and re­write, to re­tell and to offer alternatives to what we think we know.
To remind ourselves of silence as way to listen.
As I have stated a good many times in this thesis, the work of Luce Irigaray was an important guiding star for the reflection of the process, of the
writing, and on being a human and a writer in the world today. I’m sure you
remember the letters you wrote to Myres and Blegen in which you asked
them if they would grant you, a newly­appointed Guggenheim fellow, access to the tablets. And the excitement which took possession of you when
──
422
Myres agreed. Inspired by your courage, I wrote a letter, too. Not to Myres
and Blegen, obviously, but to Madame Luce Irigaray. Not to see millennia
old writing, but her, as a writer and the most poetic philosopher I know. To
the effect that I met her in person in Paris in October 2019, and I will be collaborating with her on an artistic project together with Christian (as Butterland) throughout this year, 2020.23 We don’t know where it will lead us, but
the fact that I have talked already over a shared piece of tarte au framboises
with Luce Irigaray is unbelievably precious to me. The project is envisioned
to unfold around four meetings in Paris, the first of which will take place
just a couple of days from today, a mid­January Monday.
Before I return to your story and work on turning it into a book, I have
to edit Losing Skin: the final draft is due in summer. Sometimes, I get a
shiver, when I think about the book being published. About having to do
readings, talk to readers, share my experiences and theirs. Am I really up to
that? The cover won’t say that it is an autobiographical or autoethnographical piece, it could be a collection of stories that I have been told. But what’s
the point in not revealing the truth? Then I think, for example, of Claudia
Rankine’s book Citizen, and how much I admire it. How much I admire her
strength as a woman and a writer. You made me brave enough to try to take
a stand, too.
Although I know that this is a beginning, that I’ll be working for at least
one more year on your story to turn it in to a book, and that, in fact, I am
talking to myself when I say “you”, it is incredibly hard to stop doing exactly this. It feels like I’m about to close a door, a door which I am not sure
if I will be able to find again, to re­open later. Can’t we linger in the hall for
a little longer? I think I have cookies in my bag or crisps.

Can’t we just sit over here and have a look at the door to the room which
has been opened, just to make us both disappear?
You take my hand, Alice, and we jump off. While we fall, we have time
to take a good look at everything. I see the situations and scenes I imagined
you in, in many cases inventing the surroundings was easier than imagining
you. You weren’t easy to fictionalise, because a something that fills a void
commands a body and possesses a shape, both brought into existence by
beams of light. A fiction has a presence which, despite all my cautiousness,
could be taken as fact.
To go off writing, I must escape from the broad daylight which
takes me by the eyes, which takes my eyes and fills them with broad
raw visions. I do not want to see what is shown. I want to see what is
secret. What is hidden amongst the visible. I want to see the skin of
light. I cannot write without distracting my gaze from capturing. I
write by distraction. […] writing is first of all a departure, an embarkation, an expedition. (Cixous 2005 [1996]: 184­5)
So I invented the places to invent you in, I invented the people who I
wanted to interact with you (the Moon Man, who I especially like, Dr. Moss,
Laurie, Helen and the others). You didn’t have to do much in those scenes to
make your point. Sometimes you were cheeky and cold, sometimes you
were insecure and soft. Sometimes you were in control, and sometimes you
were at the mercy of somebody else. But you always retained your integrity.
Maybe this was what got me on the track of the erroneous colportage of the
Ventris “meeting”: cracking up is something that never occurred to me.
Even through the Pope incident, you stayed focused on your role and tasks,
the personal quarrel was secondary.
Of course, the question of a romantic relationship, or at any rate a physical encounter, came up many times. In your letters, you never mentioned a
longing for someone or a discontent with having your mother live in your
house with you. I liked the idea that maybe you weren’t interested in relationships because they were just a repetitive scheme that didn’t pique your
──
424
curiosity. There was nothing to be discovered in this realm, just conventions
to be followed, freedom to be restricted.
I cannot know if that was your opinion or not. And I don’t want to. After
all, what I wrote is fiction for the most part, fiction that tells not your story
but the way I imagine your story. The longer I worked on scenes, the more
my own experiences and feelings entered the text. Sometimes I explicitly
took something I had seen or experienced and asked myself how you could
have encountered that sort or feeling, in which context you’d have had a
similar experience. In this realm in which our lives overlapped, I was often
reminded of how Hélène Cixous described her writing process, between a
dream state and being awake:
I always have a large notebook close to me and I tear myself
from my sleep to write down all my dreams. The text, which is in the
process of making itself, re­inscribes others on the text. It’s in this
way that all circulates between my life, my body, my unconscious,
history, my text, and that everything mixes in me, like my own
blood. (Cixous 2008 [1978]: 55)
You let go of my hand for a moment and our fingers intertwine. Well, it
was fun while it lasted, you say. My fingertips on the back of your hand. The
speed of our fall decreases.
