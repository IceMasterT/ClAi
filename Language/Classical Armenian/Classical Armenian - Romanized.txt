Classical Armenian - Romanized

Series Introduction
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum

Armenian is the official language of what in recent memory was the smallest republic of the former Soviet Union, now the southernmost republic of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The language is spoken by approximately four million people still living within the borders of the republic. A small group of speakers live in north-western Iran, and some communities dot the countryside of eastern Turkey. Countless emigrees have spread the language to all corners of the world. The earliest documentary evidence of the Armenians is a sixth century B.C. inscription in Behistun by the Persian king Darius I. It was nearly a thousand years, however, before the Armenians themselves began to put their language to writing, when in 406 or 407 A.D. a priest Maštʿocʿ (also known as Mesrop) developed an Armenian alphabet. One also finds reference to a prior alphabet created by the Syriac bishop Daniel, purportedly abandoned because it was ill-suited to the sound system of the language. The language whose records date back to this period is termed Classical Armenian. Much later, in the twelfth to seventeenth centuries, one finds the legacy of Middle Armenian, whose authors attempted to emulate the style of the Golden Age of Classical Armenian. Between these two time periods one further distinguishes two stages of the Armenian language: post-Classical, spanning the sixth and seventh centuries, and Pre-Middle Armenian, from the eighth to twelfth centuries. After the seventeenth century, Armenian developed into a modern form which has split into two varieties: West Armenian and East Armenian.

Origin and Geographical Location
According to Greek mythic tradition, Armenia was named after Armenus, one of Jason's Argonauts. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century B.C., states that the Armenians lived in Thrace and then moved into Phrygia, from which they crossed into the later Armenian territory. Strabo, writing in the first century B.C., states that the Armenians entered the territory from two directions, one group coming from Phrygia in the west, the other coming from Mesopotamia in the southeast. Although by neither account were they the original inhabitants of the region, Xenophon records in 400 B.C. that they seem to have absorbed most of the local dwellers.

Armenian tradition, recorded between the fifth and eighth centuries A.D., relates the Armenian people to the descendants of Noah. After the Flood, Noah's family settled in Armenia before moving south to Babylon in successive generations. One of Noah's descendants, Haik, revolted and returned to Armenia, pursued by the Babylonian Bel. Haik killed Bel and became ruler of the Armenian land, and the descendants of Haik later defended Armenia from the forces of Assyria.

Modern scholarly views are just as wide-ranging. A common view is that the Armenians were of Indo-European stock and entered the region either along with the Phrygians from the Balkan region or with the Mitanni from the area of the Aral Sea. They encountered the Urartuan culture in a period of decline and eventually came to rule over them and other Caucasian groups in the region. Another theory draws on linguistic similarities between the Armenian language and the Caucasian languages of the area to say that the Armenians had originally been themselves a Caucasian tribe which adopted an Indo-European tongue, and this Caucasian substrate is responsible for the fact that Armenian is rather genetically isolated among the Indo-European languages. Yet another theory is that the Armenians are the most sedentary members of the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European; that the Indo-European languages originated in the transcaucasian region, but the Armenians, who chose not to migrate out of the area, were marginalized during periods of Hittite and Urartuan dominance. Suffice it to say, the true origin of the Armenian peoples will remain shrouded in obscurity for some time to come.

The Armenian land itself is a plateau located roughly 5000 feet above sea level and hemmed in by mountainous regions. It lies roughly southeast of the Black Sea and southwest of the Caspian Sea. The ancient Armenian homeland was somewhat more expansive than the modern Armenian Republic, also including much of eastern Turkey, the northeastern corner of Iran, and parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia. In the northeast the Kur River separates the highland region from lowlands which sweep to the Caspian Sea. The northern border is continued by the Pontus mountain range, which extends west from the source of the Kur and shields Armenia from the Black Sea. The Taurus and Zagros mountain ranges create a natural boundary running along the entire southern expanse and cutting Armenia off from Mesopotamia. The Armenian plateau itself is divided by several smaller mountain ranges that furnish the sources for a number of unnavigable rivers. The northermost section of the Euphrates was to form the boundary between Greater and Lesser Armenia in the subsequent imperial struggles.

Linguistic Heredity and Language Contact
The status of Armenian within the Indo-European family of languages remains obscure. Few facts are certain, and those conclusions which have an air of certainty about them are often of a very general nature. The fact that some propose Armenia to be the homeland of the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European would lead one to hope that Armenian represents the language of those speakers who did not migrate into other regions, but unfortunately this seems unlikely. Most suppose the speakers of Armenian to have come to the region from the west, supplanting the Urartuan culture they encountered. The Armenian language seems to have undergone several changes between the time of arrival into the transcaucasian region and the invention of the alphabet in the fifth century A.D., but unfortunately documentary evidence for the language during this period is lacking. By the time the language is recorded, roughly forty percent of the lexicon consisted of borrowings from other languages, the phonological system had changed to resemble several features of the Caucasian languages, and the morphological system had developed as well, though less drastically than the lexicon and phonological system. The changes in consonants from Proto-Indo-European to Armenian are typified by the following:

p, b, bh become Arm. h, p, b;
t, d, dh become Arm. tʿ, t, d;
k', g', g'h become Arm. s, c, j;
kw, gw, gwh become Arm. kʿ, k, g.
The vowels developed as follows:

/u:/, /u/, /o:/ become Arm. /u/;
/o/ becomes Arm. /o/ (/a/);
/a:/, /a/ become Arm. /a/;
/e/ becomes Arm. /e/ (/a/);
/e:/, /i/, /i:/ become Arm. /i/.
In addition, there was a strong stress on the Proto-Armenian penultimate syllable, which led to the loss of any final vowel, and caused /i/ and /u/ to become the schwa in unaccented syllables.

Scholars generally believe Greek, Iranian, and Phrygian to have had the most linguistic influence on Armenian. The actual nature of Phrygian influence, however, is open to much debate because of the language's scanty attestation. The influence of the remaining languages seems to have been chiefly in the form of borrowings. Many terms of an ecclesiastical nature were adopted from Greek, as well as from Syriac, the language which formed the medium of the liturgy in Armenia for several years. But by far the greatest number of borrowings come from Iranian. Some borrowings date back to the Achaemenid period (ca. 550-330 B.C.), but Armenian felt the largest influence in the Arsacid period (ca. 53-428 A.D.). The loans can be traced to the north-eastern dialect by the presence of linguistic traits such as the presence of /rd/ instead of /l/ (e.g. Arm. vard 'rose' compared to MPers. gul 'flower'), and /z/ instead of /d/ (e.g. Arm. yazem 'I adore' compared to MPers. yad-).

Documents
The oldest documents in Armenian, dating back to the invention of the alphabet in the fifth century A.D., are of a primarily ecclesiastic nature. Presumably the Bible was the first text to be translated, followed by a number of other Greek and Syriac texts. Secular material, too, was translated, including many works by Aristotle and Neoplatonists such as Prophyry, Probus, and Diodorus. There was even an Armenian translation of the grammatical treatise of Dionysius Thrax. Some works have survived only through their Armenian translations, such as the Commentaries on the Benediction of Moses by Hippolytus, the first part of the Chronicle of Eusebius, and the Romance of Alexander the Great by Pseudo-Callisthenes. Soon native texts were composed, chiefly on historical and religious matters, such as the History of the Conversion of Armenia by Gregory the Illuminator, by Agatʿangelos, a biography of Maštocʿ by Koriwn, and Against the Sects, by Eznik of Kołb.


Lesson 1
Todd B. Krause, John A.C. Greppin, and Jonathan Slocum
The Urartuan Period
The kingdom of Urartu (ca. 870 - 590 B.C.) was the first kingdom we know to have been centered in the region of what is now greater Armenia. The earliest mention of this kingdom comes from the campaign records of the Assyrian king Ashur-nasirpal (ca. 884 - 859 B.C.). The history of Urartu is one of constant struggle with the neighboring Assyrian state. For a brief period the Assyrian kingdom fell into decline, and this allowed Urartu to gain a strong foothold in the region, spreading from the western Euphrates to the eastern Caspian lowlands, and extending from Lake Urmia in the south to the Caucasus in the north. This region became a center for vineyards and grain production; its stores of copper and iron ensured it became a hub of trade in bronze and iron weaponry. Remnants of metal tools, weapons, and pottery have been found and preserved in museums in Armenia. Urartuan cauldrons and decorative shields have been found in both Greek-speaking and Transcaucasian regions.

Arame is the first Urartuan king to be mentioned, his name recorded by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (ca. 860 - 825 B.C.). This Arame may have been the historical figure on whom is based Ara the Handsome, the legendary founder of the Armenian people described by Moses of Khoren more than a thousand years later. The Assyrian king Shammur-amat (ca. 810 - 805) is supposed by some to have lent his name to Queen Semiramis, the alluring rival in Moses of Khoren's story, who eventually led to Ara to his downfall.

The historical kingdom of Urartu itself eventually came to a period of decline. The kings Tiglath-pileser III (ca. 745 - 727 B.C.) and Sargon II (ca. 722 - 705 B.C.) reversed the decline of their Assyrian kingdom and began a long campaign against the Urartuans. The Assyrian records indicate that Urartu was at this time under attack by the Cimmerians from the north, and it seems that the two-front war was more than Urartu could sustain. Urartu was overrun and the Cimmerians poured through to attack Assyria itself. Soon thereafter, Urartu joined forces with Assyria, which was not only embroiled in conflict with the Cimmerians and the newly arrived Scythians in the north, but also with the Babylonian state to the south.

The subsequent history of Urartu falls into greater and greater obscurity. Urartu and Assyria both fell into great decline, opening up a power vacuum in the region which was filled by the Medes, Babylonians, and Egyptians. The Babylonians and Medes divided the Assyrian empire between them, but Urartu seems to have fallen solely under Median control by ca. 605-585 B.C.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The oldest Armenian text is the Bible, translated from Greek in the early fifth century. (The beginning and completion dates cannot be determined with precision, but late texts which refer to the Bible provide us with a date ante quem.) Though some have argued that the Armenians referred to the Hebrew Old Testament, there is little evidence to support this. It is likely that the New Testament was translated before the Old Testament, and here it is possible that there was Syriac influence, though the matter has not been carefully studied. This reading comes from Matthew 5:1-16.

Translation
1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up onto a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. 10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteouness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. 13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt has lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. 15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

1 The Alphabet and Sound System
1.1 The Alphabet
The Armenian alphabet was created in roughly 406 AD by a cleric named Mesrop Mastoc, initially as a vehicle for translation of the Bible. The most likely source of the alphabet is the Greek alphabet: like Greek, Armenian is read left to right; vowels are represented by separate characters, unlike nearby Semitic scripts; certain letters of the Armenian alphabet are reminiscent of the Greek, in particular the use of a digraph u to represent the sound u as in the Greek; and the use of letters to represent numerals follows the Greek method. Below is a list of the letters of the Armenian alphabet, together with their names, numerical values, and a guide to their pronunciation.

 	 	Letter	 		 	Name	 	Number	 	Pronunciation
 	 	A a	 		 	ayb	 	1	 	a as in 'father'
 	 	B b	 		 	ben	 	2	 	b as in 'boy'
 	 	G g	 		 	gim	 	3	 	g as in 'good'
 	 	D d	 		 	da	 	4	 	d as in 'dog'
 	 	E e	 		 	ečʿ	 	5	 	e as in 'bet', initially ye as in 'yes'
 	 	Z z	 		 	za	 	6	 	z as in 'zebra'
 	 	Ē ē	 		 	ē	 	7	 	ei as in 'eight'
 	 	Ə ə	 		 	etʿ	 	8	 	u as in 'but'
 	 	Tʿ tʿ	 		 	tʿo	 	9	 	t, aspirated, as in 'top'
 	 	Ž ž	 		 	žē	 	10	 	g as in 'rouge'
 	 	I i	 		 	ini	 	20	 	ee as in 'queen'
 	 	L l	 		 	liwn	 	30	 	l as in 'lamb'
 	 	X x	 		 	xē	 	40	 	ch as in (German pronunciation of) 'Bach'
 	 	C c	 		 	ca	 	50	 	t's as in 'what's up?'
 	 	K k	 		 	ken	 	60	 	k, unaspirated, as in 'skip'
 	 	H h	 		 	ho	 	70	 	h as in 'hope'
 	 	J j	 		 	ja	 	80	 	ds as in 'heads'
 	 	Ł ł	 		 	łat	 	90	 	ll as in 'ball', or ch as in Scots English 'loch', but voiced
 	 	Č č	 		 	čē	 	100	 	tch, unaspirated, as in 'matchbox'
 	 	M m	 		 	men	 	200	 	m as in 'map'
 	 	Y y	 		 	yi	 	300	 	y as in 'yes', also as in 'boy'
 	 	N n	 		 	nu	 	400	 	n as in 'now'
 	 	Š š	 		 	ša	 	500	 	sh as in 'ship'
 	 	O o	 		 	o	 	600	 	oa as in 'boat', initially vo as in 'vote'
 	 	Čʿ čʿ	 		 	čʿa	 	700	 	tch, aspirated, as in 'match'
 	 	P p	 		 	pē	 	800	 	p, unaspirated, as in 'spot'
 	 	J̌ ǰ	 		 	ǰē	 	900	 	j as in 'jump'
 	 	Ṙ ṙ	 		 	ṙa	 	1000	 	r as in 'run', but trilled
 	 	S s	 		 	sē	 	2000	 	s as in 'sip'
 	 	V v	 		 	vew	 	3000	 	v as in 'vat'
 	 	T t	 		 	tiwn	 	4000	 	t, unaspirated, as in 'stop'
 	 	R r	 		 	rē	 	5000	 	r as in 'run'
 	 	Cʿ cʿ	 		 	cʿo	 	6000	 	ts, aspirated, as in 'hats'
 	 	W w	 		 	hiwn	 	7000	 	w as in 'wet'
 	 	Pʿ pʿ	 		 	pʿiwr	 	8000	 	p, aspirated, as in 'pot'
 	 	Kʿ kʿ	 		 	kʿē	 	9000	 	k, aspirated, as in 'kit'
As mentioned above, the digraph u represents the single vowel sound u. The schwa ə is written only in initial position for monosyllabic words and for words derived from these by nominal composition. In modern printed texts it is written in polysyllabic words when hyphenated.

Beginning in the twelfth century, the letter O/o is used where one would usually find the diphthong aw. The letter F/f was introduced to represent the corresponding foreign sound, as in the f of English 'father'. Greek omega was usually represented by ov.

1.2 The Sound System
The phonological system of Classical Armenian consists of 29 consonants and 7 simple vowels. The consonants may be organized according to articulation as in the following chart.

 	 	Voiceless	 	 	 	Voiced
Plosives	 	Unaspirated	 	Aspirated	 	 
Labial	 	p	 	pʿ	 	b
Dental	 	t	 	tʿ	 	d
Velar	 	k	 	kʿ	 	g
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Affricates	 	Unaspirated	 	Aspirated	 	 
Dental	 	c	 	cʿ	 	j
Palatal	 	č	 	čʿ	 	ǰ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Fricatives	 	Voiceless	 	 	 	Voiced
Labial	 	 	 	 	 	v
Dental	 	s	 	 	 	z
Palatal	 	š	 	 	 	ž
Velar	 	x	 	 	 	 
Glottal	 	h	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasals	 	 	 	 	 	Voiced
Labial	 	 	 	 	 	m
Dental	 	 	 	 	 	n
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Liquids	 	 	 	 	 	 
Central	 	r	 	ṙ	 	 
Lateral	 	l	 	ł	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Semivowels	 	 	 	 	 	 
Palatal	 	y	 	 	 	 
Velar	 	w	 	 	 	 
Conventional pronunciation renders ł as the voiced counterpart of x , thereby lending it a fricative quality. The evidence from the classical period, however, seems to point to a heavy lateral articulation, as in Modern English 'ball'. The spelling gaył for the usual gayl shows that the distinction was not absolute within the language itself. It was also used to render the Greek lambda, as in titłos < Gk. titlos and Pawłos < Gk. Paulos.

v and w are conventionally pronounced differently, as their English counterparts. In the classical period, however, they do not seem to have been distinct phonemes, but rather allographs: v was used initially, initially in the second element of compounds, and after o with w w used elsewhere.

The vowels may be similarly organized, as in the following chart:

Vowels	 	Front	 	Central	 	Back
High	 	i	 	 	 	u
High-Mid	 	ē	 	ə	 	 
Mid	 	e	 	 	 	o
Low	 	 	 	a	 	 
There is no evidence for a distinction of vowel quantities in Classical Armenian.

Modern convention pronounces initial e as ye; the evidence for such pronunciation extending back to the classical period is unclear, since archaic texts often transcribe with initial e Greek names beginning with epsilon or the alpha-iota diphthong. The word for Jerusalem, which however would have had an initial glide, is written simply as Erosałēm, indicating that e was preceded by the glide y at least in some instances. Similarly, the pronunciation of initial o as vo seems to be post-classical.

Below is a list of the diphthongs of Classical Armenian. In some instances the conventional pronunciation diverges from the classical rendering.

ay -- conventionally pronounced as a in final position, and as uy otherwise;
oy -- conventionally pronounced as o in final position, and as uy otherwise;
aw -- conventionally pronounced as av before vowels and finally; later pronounced as o o and so rendered in written documents;
ew -- conventionally pronounced as ev before vowels and finally; often written alternately as eaw;
iw -- conventionally pronounced as iv before vowels and finally; often used to represent Greek upsilon;
ea -- conventionally pronounced as ya.
1.3 Vocalic and Consonantal Alternation
In many instances the stress of a word shifts due to addition of a morpheme. This shift may cause the originally stressed vowel to change or drop altogether. The general rules for such alternation are listed below with a few illustrative examples.

Stressed V /	 	Full Form	 	Reduced Form
Unstressed V	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
i / zero	 	sirt 'heart'	 	G srti [sərti]
 	 	amis 'month'	 	G amsoy [amso]
 	 	tʿiw 'number'	 	G tʿuoy [tʿəwo]
 	 	elikʿ 'he reads'	 	1 sg. lkʿi [ləkʿi]
 	 	 	 	 
u / zero	 	kʿun 'sleep'	 	G kʿnoy [kʿəno]
 	 	hur 'fire'	 	G hroy [həro]
 	 	ump 'he entered'	 	1 sg. mti [məti]
 	 	 	 	 
ē / i	 	vēm 'stone'	 	G vimi [vimi]
 	 	ēǰ 'side'	 	G iǰi [iǰi]
 	 	ēǰ 'he descended'	 	1 sg. iǰi [iǰi]
 	 	 	 	 
oy / u	 	loys 'light'	 	G lusoy [luso]
 	 	koys 'virgin'	 	G kusi [kusi]
 	 	ecʿoycʿ 'he showed'	 	1 sg. cʿucʿi [cʿucʿi]
 	 	 	 	 
ea / e	 	matean 'house'	 	G mateni [mateni]
 	 	seneak 'room'	 	G seneki [seneki]
 	 	sireacʿ 'he loved'	 	1 sg. sirecʿi [sirecʿi]
 	 	 	 	 
ew / iw	 	ewł 'oil'	 	G iwłoy [iwło]
There are some exceptions to these rules. Other vowels undergo no change under change of stress.

There are also some general tendencies of alternation between consonants in certain environments.

r / ṙ -- r often changes to r before n, e.g. leaṙn 'mountain', G lerin, Ab leṙnē (< *lerinē); aṙnem 'I do', Aor. arari.
h / zero -- initial h is lost in combination, e.g. hat-anem 'I cut', but lezu-at (< *lezu‘hat) 'with cut tongue'.
w / v / b -- /v/ is realized as b after the consonants m, r, ł; as w after the vowels a, i; and as v after o. Examples are matamb from matn 'finger', astełb from astł 'star', kayserb from kaysr 'Caesar', azgaw from asg 'nation', bayiw from bay 'word', getov from geto 'river'.
cʿ / s -- before cʿ and ǰ, cʿ dissimilates to s, e.g. 1 sg. sirecʿicʿ 'I shall love', 2 sg. sirescʿes (< *sirecʿcʿes < *sirecʿicʿes), 2 pl. siresǰikʿ (< *sirecʿǰikʿ < *sirecʿiǰikʿ).
2 Nominal Declension
Classical Armenian nouns and adjectives display two numbers, singular and plural, and seven cases: Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative, Locative, Ablative, and Instrumental. There is no purely grammatical gender of the sort found in languages such as Latin. There are several declension paradigms, which broadly fall into two categories: those with variable stems and those with invariable stems. One should note that stem variation is a phenomenon distinct from vocalic alternation. Vowel alternation occurs automatically whenever there is a change of stress due to the addition of a morpheme, and it therefore bears no relation to patterns of declension.

2.1 Nouns with Invariable Stems Ending in a Consonant
Nouns with invariable stems may be divided into two groups: those ending in a vowel, and those ending in a consonant. Of those ending in a consonant, there are four declensions, categorized according to the vowel found in the genitive plural: a, i, u, o. The nouns am 'year', ban 'word', cov 'sea', and beran 'mouth' illustrate the declension.

Singular

 	 	a	 	i	 	u	 	o
Nom.	 	am	 	ban	 	cov	 	beran
Acc.	 	am	 	ban	 	cov	 	beran
Gen.	 	ami	 	bani	 	covu	 	beranoy
Dat.	 	ami	 	bani	 	covu	 	beranoy
Loc.	 	ami	 	bani	 	covu	 	beran
Abl.	 	amē	 	banē	 	covē	 	beranoy
Inst.	 	amaw	 	baniw	 	covu	 	beranov
Plural

 	 	a	 	i	 	u	 	o
Nom.	 	amkʿ	 	bankʿ	 	covkʿ	 	berankʿ
Acc.	 	ams	 	bans	 	covs	 	berans
Gen.	 	amacʿ	 	banicʿ	 	covucʿ	 	beranocʿ
Dat.	 	amacʿ	 	banicʿ	 	covucʿ	 	beranocʿ
Loc.	 	ams	 	bans	 	covs	 	berans
Abl.	 	amacʿ	 	banicʿ	 	covucʿ	 	beranocʿ
Inst.	 	amawkʿ	 	baniwkʿ	 	covukʿ	 	beranovkʿ
Nouns ending in -eay follow the i-declension, e.g. hreay 'Jew', G sg. hrei; N pl. hreaykʿ, G pl. hreicʿ, etc.

Some nouns of the u-declension have an ablative singular ending in -uē, e.g. spas 'service', G sg. spasu, Ab sg. spasuē.

Some nouns of the o-declension optionally have the ending -i in the Locative case, for example mēǰ 'middle':

i mēǰ Accusative or Locative;
i mēǰoy Ablative;
i miǰi Locative.
Proper nouns of the a-declension are characterized by the ending -ay in the genitive, dative, locative, and ablative singular. Tigran provides an example:

 	 	a-decl.
Nom.	 	Tigran
Acc.	 	Tigran
Gen.	 	Tigranay
Dat.	 	Tigranay
Loc.	 	Tigranay
Abl.	 	Tigranay
Inst.	 	Tigranaw
2.2 Substantives with Invariable Stems Ending in a Vowel
A large number of nouns and adjectives have invariable stems ending in the vowel -i. These fall into two declensions, the o-declension and the a-declension. The a-declension has a special Locative ending -oǰ and Ablative ending -oǰē. The nouns hogi 'spirit, soul' and tełi 'place' illustrate the o- and a-declensions, respectively.

Singular

 	 	o	 	a
Nom.	 	hogi	 	tełi
Acc.	 	hogi	 	tełi
Gen.	 	hogwoy	 	tełwoy
Dat.	 	hogwoy	 	tełwoy
Loc.	 	hogi	 	tełwoǰ
Abl.	 	hogwoy	 	tełwoy, tełwoǰē
Inst.	 	hogwov	 	tełeaw
Plural

 	 	o	 	a
Nom.	 	hogikʿ	 	tełikʿ
Acc.	 	hogis	 	tełis
Gen.	 	hogwocʿ	 	tełeacʿ
Dat.	 	hogwocʿ	 	tełeacʿ
Loc.	 	hogis	 	tełis
Abl.	 	hogwocʿ	 	tełeacʿ
Inst.	 	hogwovkʿ	 	tełeawkʿ
Adjectives derived from place names by means of the suffix -acʿi follow the declension of hogi, with G plural in -wocʿ, e.g. Atʿenacʿi 'Athenian, one from Athens', G pl. Atʿenacʿwocʿ. On the other hand, nouns with the suffix -acʿi which are not derived from place names follow the declension of tełi, e.g. dracʿi, G pl. dracʿeacʿ 'neighbor' derived from durkʿ 'door'.

3 The Present System of Verbs
Verbal forms in Classical Armenian are built from two stems, the present and the aorist. One or both of these stems may contain a suffix inserted between the root and the inflectional vowel (in the present), or between root and ending (in the aorist). The present stem is the base for an indicative mood, subjunctive and (negative) imperative. The indicative mood separates into two tenses: present and imperfect. Nominal forms may arise from the present stem, namely an infinitive and participle. Inasmuch as verbal aspect is distinguished in Classical Armenian, the present system forms denote a developing or continuous action, while the aorist forms refer to an action's completion.

3.1 Present Indicative of 'to be'
The present indicative of the verb 'to be' illustrates the endings of the present indicative of all verbs. The forms are as follows.

 	 	Singular	 	Plural
1st	 	em	 	emkʿ
2nd	 	es	 	ēkʿ
3rd	 	ē	 	en
Note that e + y > ē, so that the endings are -m, -s, -y, -mkʿ, -ykʿ, -n.

3.2 The Present Indicative of All Verbs
The forms of the present indicative are comprised of a stem, characteristic vowel, and the present indicative endings. There are five possible characteristic vowels: e, i, a, u, o. The endings are the same as those listed above for the verb 'to be'. sirem 'I love', sirim 'I am loved', lam 'I weep', hełum 'I pour', and gom 'I exist' illustrate the paradigms.

 	 	e	 	i	 	a	 	u	 	o
1 sg.	 	sirem	 	sirim	 	lam	 	hełum	 	*gom
2 sg.	 	sires	 	siris	 	las	 	hełus	 	*gos
3 sg.	 	sirē	 	siri	 	lay	 	hełu	 	goy
1 pl.	 	siremkʿ	 	sirimkʿ	 	lamkʿ	 	hełumkʿ	 	*gomkʿ
2 pl.	 	sirēkʿ	 	sirikʿ	 	laykʿ	 	hełukʿ	 	*goykʿ
3 pl.	 	siren	 	sirin	 	lan	 	hełun	 	gon
*gom is the sole verb of the o-class. It is only recorded in third person forms.

3.3 The Present Infinitive
The present infinitive is built from the present stem by addition of a characteristic vowel and the suffix -l. The characteristic vowel exhibited by a given verb is the same as that found in the present indicative forms, with the exception that verbs in -em and -im both exhibit the vowel e in the infinitive. Thus the verbs above form the infinitives sirel 'to love', lal 'to weep', hełul 'to pour', gol 'to exist'. The infinitive is declined as an o-type singular noun:

 	 	-el	 	-al	 	-ul	 	-ol
Nom.	 	sirel	 	lal	 	hełul	 	gol
Acc.	 	sirel	 	lal	 	hełul	 	gol
Gen.	 	sireloy	 	laloy	 	hełloy	 	goloy
Dat.	 	sireloy	 	laloy	 	hełloy	 	goloy
Loc.	 	sirel	 	lal	 	hełul	 	gol
Abl.	 	sireloy	 	laloy	 	hełloy	 	goloy
Inst.	 	sirelov	 	lalov	 	hełlov	 	golov
In the post-classical era infinitives in -il appear in order to distinguish verbs in -im.

3.4 The Imperfect Tense of All verbs
The imperfect indicative is built from the same stem as the present indicative, but makes no distinction between verbal stems ending in -e or -i. Therefore verbal pairs such as sirem 'I love' and sirim 'I am loved' lose their distinction in the imperfect. The conjugation is as follows.

 	 	-e/-i	 	-a	 	-u	 	-o
1 sg.	 	sirei	 	layi	 	hełui	 	-
2 sg.	 	sireir	 	layir	 	hełuir	 	-
3 sg.	 	sirēr	 	layr	 	hełoyr	 	goyr
1 pl.	 	sireakʿ	 	layakʿ	 	hełuakʿ	 	-
2 pl.	 	sireikʿ	 	layikʿ	 	hełuikʿ	 	-
3 pl.	 	sirein	 	layin	 	hełuin	 	goyin
The third person singular is one syllable shorter than the other forms.

In the post-classical period -em and -im verbs were distinguished in the third person singular by means of an innovative ending -iwr: sirēr 'he loved', siriwr 'he was loved'.

3.5 The Present Subjunctive
The present subjunctive is formed from the present tense stem with its characteristic vowel, to which the suffix -icʿ is added, and to this the usual present indicative endings. With the endings, however, only forms in -em, -im and -um are distinguished. For example, sirem forms sire + icʿ + em > siricʿem, sirim forms siri + icʿ + im > siricʿim. Verbs with present indicative in -am take present subjunctive endings in -em, so that lam forms la + icʿ + em > laycʿem. But hełum forms hełu + icʿ + um > hełucʿum.

Although formation of the passive will be treated more fully, later, it is important to point out here that verbs in -am make in the subjunctive a distinction between active and passive which is not found in the indicative. In the same fashion that allows sirem 'I love' to be opposed to sirim 'I am loved', so in the subjunctive ałam 'I grind' distinguishes the active ałaycʿem from the passive ałaycʿim.

Conjugation follows the pattern of the indicative, as the paradigms below illustrate:

 	 	e	 	i	 	a	 	u	 	o
1 sg.	 	siricʿem	 	siricʿim	 	laycʿem	 	hełucʿum	 	 
2 sg.	 	siricʿes	 	siricʿis	 	laycʿes	 	hełucʿus	 	 
3 sg.	 	siricʿē	 	siricʿi	 	laycʿē	 	hełucʿu	 	gucʿē (< *goycʿē)
1 pl.	 	siricʿemkʿ	 	siricʿimkʿ	 	laycʿemkʿ	 	hełucʿumkʿ	 	 
2 pl.	 	siricʿēkʿ	 	siricʿikʿ	 	laycʿēkʿ	 	hełucʿukʿ	 	 
3 pl.	 	siricʿen	 	siricʿin	 	laycʿen	 	hełucʿun	 	 
The form gucʿē is often used in the adverbial sense of 'perhaps'. The verb 'to be' has the following present subjunctive forms:

 	 	Singular	 	Plural
1st	 	icʿem	 	icʿemkʿ
2nd	 	icʿes	 	icʿēkʿ
3rd	 	icʿē	 	icʿen
In the second person one also finds forms adopted from the aorist: second person singular -ijir and plural -ijikʿ. These forms are typically employed in the role of futures or imperatives. The singular form is generally, and the plural form occasionally, used in a passive sense, e.g. sirijir 'be thou loved' and sirijikʿ 'be ye loved'.

3.6 The Present Imperative
The present imperative is used only in prohibitive statements, accompanied by the negative particle mi. Only the second person singular present imperative has distinct forms, the others being the same as the present indicative. Formation is based on the present stem with characteristic vowel, to which is added the ending -r. Thus

 	 	-em	 	-im	 	-am	 	-um
2 sg.	 	mi sirer	 	mi sirir	 	mi lar	 	mi hełur
The imperative of 'to be' is used only in the expression słj er 'be thou well, greetings', translating the Greek chaire. The second person plural, of course, is słj ēkʿ 'be ye well, greetings' (Gk. chairete).

4 Word Order and Congruence
Word order in Classical Armenian is free, with words placed toward the beginning of an utterance gaining prominence. In Biblical translations, the word order often follows that of the Greek text.

Word order may affect the congruence between an adjective an the word it modifies. Attributive adjectives are undeclined when they precede a noun, declined when they follow the noun. For example, in John 10.32 one finds bazum gorcs baris. Here, bazum is the uninflected N/Ac singular form of the adjective bazum, -acʿ 'much, many'; gorcs is the inflected Ac plural form of the noun gorc, -ocʿ 'work, deed'; baris is the inflected Ac plural of the adjective bari, -eacʿ 'good'. In predicate sentences, the predicated adjective is in the Nominative case and singular, even if the subject is plural, unless the adjective follows the copula directly. Thus one might have azat en Haykʿ 'The Armenians are free', but vardapetkʿ en imastumkʿ 'Teachers are wise.'

The verb agrees with its subject in person and number. Coordinated subjects require a plural verb. Singular subjects with collective meaning may have either singular or plural verb forms.

5 Prepositions
Armenian has a wealth of words functioning as prepositions. Many of these, however, are adverbs or collocations of a simple preposition and a noun, which in turn govern a noun in the genitive. Prepositions generally precede the noun they govern, but some follow the noun as a postposition. There are six basic prepositions, listed in the chart below with the cases they govern and their meaning appropriate to each case.

Prep.	 	Case	 	Associated Meaning
aṙ	 	Acc.	 	to, toward (motion toward a person)
 	 	Loc.	 	beside, Fr. chez
 	 	Inst.	 	beside, in the time of (with person's name), in addition to
 	 	 	 	 
ənd	 	Acc.	 	through, along, by way of, against, during
 	 	Gen.	 	instead of, in exchange for
 	 	Loc.	 	with, in the company of
 	 	Inst.	 	under
 	 	 	 	 
əst	 	Acc.	 	on, onto
 	 	Dat.	 	according to
 	 	Loc.	 	according to
 	 	Abl.	 	one after another (e.g. year by year)
 	 	 	 	 
z	 	Acc.	 	during, for
 	 	Abl.	 	concerning
 	 	Inst.	 	around, about
 	 	 	 	 
i	 	Acc.	 	to, into, upon
 	 	Loc.	 	in, at, under
 	 	Abl.	 	from, out of, away from; out of (in partitive sense); by (agent in passive sentence)
 	 	 	 	 
cʿ	 	Acc.	 	to, up to
The prepositions z and cʿ are inseparable from the following noun; similarly i, which becomes y before vowels.

Below are listed some of the more frequent adverbs used as prepositions. They all govern the genitive case.

 	 	Adverb	 	Meaning with Genitive
 	 	aṙaǰi	 	in front of, before (of time)
 	 	artakʿoy	 	outside
 	 	nerkʿoy	 	inside, under
 	 	čʿurǰ	 	around
 	 	vasn, ałazaw	 	concerning, because of
 	 	het	 	with, after (of time)
 	 	yet, zkni	 	after, following
 	 	aṙancʿ	 	without
 	 	pʿoxanak	 	instead of, for, on behalf of
The word handerc may govern the Instrumental case in the sense 'with, in the company of'. It may come either before or after the noun it governs.

Common compound prepositions are i veray 'above' and i mēǰ 'amidst'. They take the genitive case, which may be placed between the two components, e.g. i hroy mēǰ 'in the fire, in the midst of the fire'.


Lesson 2
Todd B. Krause, John A.C. Greppin, and Jonathan Slocum
The Yervanduni Dynasty
Yervanduni is the name given to a family whose members were appointed by the Medes and Persians as governors in Armenia over the period 585 - 200 B.C. At least four of these governors were named Yervand. Their ethnic background is not clear. Most now believe the Urartuan and Armenian ethnicities to have been distinct, and it is not certain from which culture the Yervandunis originated. The Yervandunis were related somehow to the Persians, if not by blood, at least through bonds of marriage.

By roughly 610 B.C., the Medes and Babylonians had divided the remnants of the Assyrian empire, and the Medes began to consolidate their power in the north. Having captured portions of Urartu and Mesopotamia, by 585 B.C. the Medes were a dominant force in the region. They appointed a Yervanduni family member to administer the Urartuan province.

Median hegemony did not last long. A number of the subjugated states rose in rebellion under the leadership of the Persian Cyrus. Among those rebelling were the Yervandunis. By 550 B.C. Cyrus had overthrown the Medes and established the beginnings of the Achaemenid dynasty, one which would greatly expand Persian influence through the exploits of Cyrus' son Cambyses, and later those of Darius I.

The reasons are not clear, but somehow, after the fall of the Urartuan kingdom, Armenian culture gained in prestige and was eventually recognized as one of the important satrapies listed by Darius I on the Behistun rock (ca. 520 B.C.). This is the first record of the name Armenia. Darius had apparently campaigned against the Armenians when they rose in revolt against his taxes. To quell such rebellious tendencies, Darius may have installed a governor from another family, since there is no mention of the Yervandunis until the next century.

Under Achaemenid rule, the Armenians were free to live according to their own cultural dictates, as long as they paid tribute to the Persian empire. Most of our knowledge of Armenia during this period comes from the Anabasis of Xenophon, who travelled through the region with Greek troops in 401 - 400 B.C. Xenophon tells of a ruler Yervand, who was son-in-law to the Persian king Artaxerxes I. The Armenian satrapy evidently consisted of a non-Armenian enclave in the highlands, perhaps remnants of the Urartuan culture, and whom some believe to be the ancestors of the modern Kurds. Xenophon mentions underground winter quarters in some towns, an abundance of food, and a type of beer drunk through a reed straw.

Persian culture left an indelible imprint in Armenia. Although Aramaic seems to have been the language of administration during this period, Armenian is infused with several words borrowed from Persian. Armenians also seem to have adopted many Persian social practices, as well as something of the Zoroastrian pantheon. The Armenians dedicated several temples and festivals to Anahit, goddess of fertility and wisdom.

By the middle of the fourth century B.C., the Achaemenid dynasty had fallen into decline, allowing the Yervandunis to consolidate their power and create a nearly autonomous Armenian province. Darius III, supported in battle by another Armenian satrap named Yervand, finally fell before the onslaught of Alexander the Great in roughly 330 B.C. Under Alexander, and, after his death in 323 B.C., under Seleucid reign, Greek culture began to impose itself on the region.

Alexander's conquests did not take him through Armenian territory, however, and so the fall of the Persian empire left the Yervandunis an opportunity for consolidating a completely independent rule over the Armenian region. Initially Alexander appointed governors over Armenia, but the Yervandunis led a revolt and refused taxation. They reasserted their autonomy later in the face of the Seleucids. In the end, three distinct regions opened up in the Armenian region. There was a western region, Lesser Armenia, which periodically fell under Seleucid rule and was never completely annexed by the Yervandunis. To the east of this was the region of Dsopk, which acted as a buffer region between Lesser Armenia and the third region, Greater Armenia, in which the Yervanduni foothold was firm. Yervanduni rule finally came to an end in roughly 200 B.C., when they were overthrown by the Armenian noble Artashes, incited to revolt by the Seleucids.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Moses Khorenatsi (that is, Moses of Khoren) is the father of Armenian history and is traditionally believed to have written in the fifth century A.D. Other scholars have suggested the seventh century. Some of his work is based on a mythological history, which he describes with the same belief as the later true historical renderings of the Persian era up to the establishment of Christianity. This reading is taken from his History, Book II, Chapter 30.

Translation
At that time Marinus, son of Storgius, took the post of the emperor's chiliarch over the Phoenicians and Palestinians, the Syrians and Mesopotamians. And to him Abgar sent two from among his notables, Mar Ihab, the consul of Aghjnik', and Shamshagram, a senior prince of the dynasty of the Apahunis, as well as Anan his confidant, to the city of Bet-Kubin, to inform him of the reasons of his going to the East by showing him the text of the agreement which was between Artashes and his brothers, and to make him an aid of his support. And they, upon arriving, found him in Eleutheropolis. And he, having received them with peace and honor, gave an answer to Abgar: Do not doubt the emperor on account of this, merely that you hasten to pay his tribute off in full. And they, having returned from there, went up to Jerusalem to see our Savior Christ on account of hearing the news of the miracles; and being witness to this, they recounted this to Abgar. Astonished at this, Abgar recognized him truly as son of God, and said: "These marvels are not of man but of God, for there is no one among men who is able to raise the dead, save God alone." And because his own body was corrupted by terrible pains, which had befallen him in the land of the Persians seven years before, and which among men there was not for him a means of curing, he granted to be taken to him a letter of entreaty to come and cure him of his pains....
Grammar
6 Nominal Declension
The remaining declensions of nouns and adjectives have variable stems. For the most part these stems end in the resonants r, ł, n. Some substantives retain the resonant throughout the paradigm, while others do not. Of those that do, one finds changes in the stem-vowel preceding the resonant.

6.1 Stem Variation vs. Vocalic Alternation
An important distinction must be made between the concepts of stem variation and vocalic alternation. Vocalic alternation occurs whenever a morpheme is added which changes the stress of a word. It is an automatic process and occurs according to the rules described in the first lesson. It therefore plays no functional role in declension. Thus words such as aṙaǰin 'first' (GDAb aṙaǰnoy), surb 'holy' (GDAb srboy), loys 'light' (GDAb lusoy), mēǰ 'middle' (GDAb miǰoy) all show regular vocalic alternation as a result of addition of the morpheme -oy, which entails a change in stress. These are therefore all invariable-stem substantives, just as e.g. Astuac 'God' (GDAb Astuacoy), beran 'mouth' (GDAb beranoy), get 'river' (GDAb getoy). Stem variation, by contrast, is bound to declension; it is not the result of automatic stress shift and, as such, is in and of itself indicative of the case of a given noun. Thus azn 'kind, race' displays forms NAc Sg. azn and GDL Sg. azin; the variation is not conditioned by any stress shift due to addition of a morpheme. It may happen, however, that in some words both stem variation and vocalic alternation take place: jukn 'fish', GDL *jukan > jkan; dustr 'daughter', GDL *duster > dster; leaṙn 'mountain', GDL *learin > lerin.

In general the declensions of variable stem substantives may be distinguished on the basis of whether the noun uses two or three stem variants within a paradigm. The following chart shows some possibilities of the two-stem declensions. The term 'obliques' specifies any case not explicitly mentioned under one stem or another.

 	 	Stem 1: N Ac sg.	 	Stem 2: obliques, N Ac L pl.
Nouns in -r, -ł	 	 	 	 
 	 	oskr 'bone'	 	osker-
 	 	astł 'star'	 	asteł-
 	 	dustr 'daughter'	 	dster-
 	 	 	 	 
Nouns in -n	 	 	 	 
 	 	himn 'foundation'	 	himan-
 	 	akn 'gem'	 	akan-
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Stem 1: N Ac sg./pl., L pl.	 	Stem 2: obliques
 	 	 	 	 
Nouns in -n	 	 	 	 
 	 	šun 'dog'	 	s'an-
 	 	tun 'house'	 	tan-
 	 	 	 	 
Most nouns in -iwn	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ariwn 'blood'	 	arean-
 	 	zerutʿiwn 'imprisonment'	 	zerutʿean-
On the other hand there are three-stem declensions. These may be broken down as follows.

 	 	Stem 1: N Ac sg.	 	Stem 2: obliques	 	Stem 3: N Ac L pl.
Most nouns in -n	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	jukn 'fish'	 	jkan-	 	jkun-
 	 	duṙn 'door'	 	dran-	 	drun-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Action nouns in -umn	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	šeržumn 'movement'	 	šeržman-	 	šeržmun-
 	 	erdumn 'oath'	 	erdman-	 	erdmun-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Words lacking -n in N Ac sg.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	manuk 'child'	 	mankan-	 	mankun-
 	 	ałǰik 'maiden'	 	ałǰkan-	 	ałǰkun-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Stem 1: N Ac sg.	 	Stem 2: G D L (Ab) sg., N Ac L pl.	 	Stem 3: obliques
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	azn 'nation, race'	 	azin-	 	azan-
 	 	gaṙn 'lamb'	 	gaṙin-	 	gaṙan-
 	 	harsn 'bride'	 	harsin-	 	harsan-
The ablative singular is usually built from Stem 2, sometimes with loss of the vowel preceding -n; occasionally the ablative singular is built from Stem 3.

Certainly other classification systems are possible, and indeed, each grammar of Classical Armenian tends to have its own idiosyncratic declensional scheme. Notable among these is the system used by Schmitt in Grammatik des Klassisch-Armenischen. Schmitt sets out declensions according to theme: e.g. a-, i-, etc. declension, r-, l-, n-stem; he then divides some of these into Primary Type (Haupttypus, here Ht) and Secondary Type (Nebentypus, here Nt). These types may be further divided into subclasses A and B, and these further into 1 and 2. In the following, where easily discernible, Schmitt's classification will be noted among the paradigms in order to facilitate the transition to previous work in the field. When necessary, the theme will be explicitly mentioned with the abbreviation T, so that T-u refers to the u-declension.

6.2 r- and ł-Stems
All nouns ending in ł and most ending in r retain these consonants in the oblique cases; in cases other than the N and Ac the vowel -e- intercedes between the base and -ł/-r. Still other nouns show a diphthong, e.g. ew, in the N and Ac singular which is shortened to e in the remaining forms. The nouns oskr 'bone', ałbewr 'source, fountain', and astł 'star', illustrate the declensions.

 	 	T-r, Ht	 	T-r, Nt-A	 	T-ł
 	 	-r/-er	 	-ewr/-er	 	-ł/-eł
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	oskr	 	ałbewr	 	astł
Ac	 	oskr	 	ałbewr	 	astł
G	 	osker	 	ałber	 	asteł
D	 	osker	 	ałber	 	asteł
L	 	osker	 	ałber	 	asteł
Ab	 	oskerē	 	ałberē	 	astełē
I	 	oskerb	 	ałberb	 	astełb
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	oskerkʿ	 	ałberkʿ	 	astełkʿ
Ac	 	oskers	 	ałbers	 	astełs
G	 	oskeracʿ	 	ałberacʿ	 	astełacʿ
D	 	oskeracʿ	 	ałberacʿ	 	astełacʿ
L	 	oskers	 	ałbers	 	astełs
Ab	 	oskeracʿ	 	ałberacʿ	 	astełacʿ
I	 	oskerawkʿ	 	ałberawkʿ	 	asteławkʿ
6.3 n-Stems with Two Stems
Nouns whose stem ends in -n are quite common in Classical Armenian. Many of these display two stems in their declension. Nouns of this sort fall into two categories according to which cases display different stems. In particular, one finds the types

(a) Stem 1: NAc Sg.; Stem 2: oblique cases, NAcL Pl.;
(b) Stem 1: NAc Sg., NAcL Pl.; Stem 2: oblique cases.
Again, the term 'oblique' refers to any case not explicitly mentioned. Examples of type-(a) are given by the nouns kołmn 'side', stems kołmn-/kołman-; and anun 'name', stems anun-/anuan-. Examples of type-(b) are given by the nouns tun 'house', stems tun-/tan-; and gerutʿiwn 'imprisonment', stems gerutʿiwn-/gerutʿean-.

 	 	Ht B	 	Ht B	 	Nt B2	 	Nt B1
 	 	(a)	 	(a)	 	(b)	 	(b)
 	 	kołmn	 	anun	 	tun	 	gerutʿiwn
 	 	'side'	 	'name'	 	'house'	 	'imprisonment'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	kołmn	 	anun	 	tun	 	gerutʿiwn
Ac	 	kołmn	 	anun	 	tun	 	gerutʿiwn
G	 	kołman	 	anuan	 	tan	 	gerutʿean
D	 	kołman	 	anuan	 	tan	 	gerutʿean
L	 	kołman	 	anuan	 	tan	 	gerutʿean
Ab	 	kołmanē	 	anuanē	 	tanē	 	gerutʿenē
I	 	kołmamb	 	anuamb	 	tamb	 	gerutʿeamb
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	kołmankʿ	 	anuankʿ	 	tunkʿ	 	gerutʿiwnkʿ
Ac	 	kołmans	 	anuans	 	tunkʿ	 	gerutʿiwns

D	 	kołmancʿ	 	anuancʿ	 	tancʿ	 	gerutʿeancʿ
L	 	kołmans	 	anuans	 	tuns	 	gerutʿiwns

I	 	kołmambkʿ	 	anuambkʿ	 	tambkʿ	 	gerutʿeambkʿ
6.4 n-Stems with Three Stems
Some n-stem nouns display three stems throughout their declension. These also may be divided into two categories based on which stem appears in each case.

(c) Stem 1: NAc Sg.; Stem 2: oblique cases; Stem 3: NAcL Pl.;
(d) Stem 1: NAc Sg.; Stem 2: GDL(Ab) Sg., NAcL Pl.; Stem 3: oblique cases.
In nouns of type-(d), the ablative is typically built from stem 2, but occasionally from stem 3. Type-(c) is illustrated by the nouns duṙn 'door', stems duṙn-/dran-/drun-; šaržumn 'imprisonment', stems šaržumn-/šaržman-/šaržmun-; manuk 'child', stems manuk-/mankan-/mankun-; ałǰik 'maiden', stems ałǰik-/ałǰkan-/ałǰkun-. Type-(d) is illustrated by the nouns azn 'race, kind', stems azn-/azin-/azan-; gaṙn 'lamb', stems gaṙn-/gaṙin-/gaṙan-.

Notice the forms aznē and gaṙnē, shortened from azinē and gaṙinē respectively.

Some nouns exhibit features of both the (c) and (d) declension types. Examples are the nouns tʿoṙn 'grandchild' and harsn 'bride'.

 	 	(c)+(d)	 	(c)+(d)

7 Demonstratives
7.1 Demonstrative Suffixes
Classical Armenian has three demonstrative suffixes which are attached to the end of nouns. These are

-s 'this, this here, this near to me';
-d 'that, that right there, that next to you';
-n 'that, that over there, that near to him'.
These correlate roughly to the use of Latin hic, iste, and ille, respectively. These particles, however, are indeclinable. Since Classical Armenian has no articles as such, an unqualified noun may be either definite or indefinite; these demonstrative suffixes are often used for marking a noun as definite (and in that sense overlap with z-, which is pre-posed on definite nouns in the accusative). In this role -n is by far the most commonly used; -s and -d are reserved for particular emphasis or change of subject. Note the possibility of overlap, e.g. ajss could be either ays 'evil spirit' plus the accusative plural ending -s, or the same noun in the singular but with the deictic suffix -s. Moreover, one may find aysss, that is, ajs + Ac Pl. -s + suffix -s.

There are a few tendencies in the usage of the demonstrative suffixes. Proper names rarely take demonstrative suffixes, e.g. tʿagawor-n Parsicʿ 'the king of the Persians', where English inserts before 'Persians' an article which is not present in the Armenian. Another example is Aršak arkʿay 'Arshak the king'. When an adjective modifies a noun, typically only the noun receives a demonstrative suffix, e.g. vkayn surb 'the holy martyr'. If a noun in the genitive qualifies a definite noun, typically the last word of the collocation receives the demonstrative suffix, e.g. barekan tʿagawori-n 'the king's friend, the friend of the king'. Vocatives use the suffix -d, e.g. Kʿristos-d 'O Christ'. Adjectives used as substantives may take demonstrative suffixes, as in čʿarn 'the evil one, Satan'; aṙakʿealkʿn 'the ones sent, the apostles', built from the participle aṙakʿeal 'sent'; gełecʿikd 'O beautiful one'.

Relative clauses may also take a demonstrative suffix. The suffix -s, -d, or -n is added to the first stressed word of the relative clause.

7.2 Demonstrative Adjectives
The same threefold distinction as in the suffixes -s, -d, -n is found in the demonstrative adjectives ajs 'this here', ayd 'that', ayn 'that over there'. These adjectives also have a long form which is used as an emphatic. The threefold distinction is also made in the demonstrative pronouns sa, da, na, which may also function as the third person pronoun. Likewise the distinction is made in the pronoun and adjective soyn 'this same', doyn 'that same', noyn 'that same there'. The paradigms of the -n series are given below to illustrate the declensions.

 	 	ay-s, -d, -n	 	ay- (emph.)	 	s-, d-, n-a	 	s-, d-, n-oyn
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ayn	 	ayn	 	na	 	noyn
Ac	 	ayn	 	ayn	 	na	 	noyn
G	 	aynr	 	aynorik	 	nora	 	norin, norun
D	 	aynm	 	aynmik	 	nma	 	nmin
L	 	aynm	 	aynmik	 	nma	 	nmin
Ab	 	aynm	 	aynmanē	 	nmanē	 	nmin
I	 	aynu	 	aynuik	 	novaw	 	novin, novimb
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	aynkʿ	 	aynokʿik	 	nokʿa	 	nokʿin, noynkʿ
Ac	 	ayns	 	aynosik	 	nosa	 	nosin, noyns
G	 	ayncʿ	 	aynocʿik	 	nocʿa	 	nocʿin, nocʿuncʿ
D	 	ayncʿ	 	aynocʿik	 	nocʿa	 	nocʿin, nocʿuncʿ
L	 	ayns	 	aynosik	 	nosa	 	nosin, noyns
Ab	 	ayncʿ, ayncʿanē	 	aynocʿik	 	nocʿa, nocʿanē	 	nocʿin, nocʿuncʿ
I	 	aynukʿ	 	aynokʿiwkʿ	 	nokʿawkʿ	 	nokʿimbkʿ, nokʿumbkʿ
8 The Aorist System of Verbs
Classical Armenian has a two-stem verbal system, wherein each verb form pertains either to a present or to an aorist stem of a given root. Generally, one or both of the stems will contain a suffix inserted directly after the root, thus preceding the thematic vowel in present forms and preceding the endings in aorist forms. There are several such suffixes in the present system (-an-, -n-, -čʿ-, -nčʿ-), but only one type, namely -(V)cʿ-, in the aorist system. There are five basic distinctions in the two-stem system:

(a) Aorist stem extended:

 	 	Present	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Aorist
 	 	pʿory-em	 	'I tempt'	 	 	 	pʿory-ecʿ-i
 	 	hay-im	 	'I look'	 	 	 	hay-ecʿ-ay
 	 	as-em	 	'I say'	 	 	 	as-acʿ-i
 	 	ors-am	 	'I hunt'	 	 	 	ors-acʿ-i
 	 	yus-am	 	'I hope'	 	 	 	yus-acʿ-ay
(b) Present stem extended:

 	 	Present	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Aorist
 	 	pag-an-em	 	'I kiss'	 	 	 	pag-i
 	 	hec-an-im	 	'I ride'	 	 	 	hec-ay
 	 	pʿax-čʿ-im	 	'I flee'	 	 	 	pʿaxe-ay
(c) Both stems extended:

 	 	Present	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Aorist
 	 	moṙ-an-am	 	'I forget'	 	 	 	moṙ-acʿ-ay
 	 	l-n-um	 	'I fill'	 	 	 	l-cʿ-i (3rd Sg. elicʿ, from root li-)
(d) Neither stem extended:

 	 	Present	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Aorist
 	 	han-em	 	'I draw'	 	 	 	han-i
 	 	nst-im	 	'I sit down'	 	 	 	nst-ay (root nist-)
 	 	tʿoł-um	 	'I let'	 	 	 	tʿoł-i
(e) Suppletive system:

 	 	Present	 	Meaning	 	 	 	Aorist
 	 	əmp-em	 	'I drink'	 	 	 	arb-i
 	 	ertʿ-am	 	'I go'	 	 	 	čʿog-ay
Aorists without suffixes are termed root aorists. Other terms are strong or second aorists. Aorists with the -(V)cʿ suffix are sometimes known as weak or first aorists.

The distinction between present and aorist is not one of tense, but of aspect. Both imperfect and aorist indicative are past tenses; both present and aorist subjunctive lack tense altogether. Verbal forms built from the present stem denote a continuous, ongoing action -- an action in its development. By contrast, verbs forms built from the aorist stem refer to the completion of the action. These distinctions are without regard to the actual point on a timeline at which an action occurs; they point to the nature of the action described. In principle, then, one could find "present aorist" forms, "past present" forms, and so on. "Past present" forms, in this sense denoting past actions with continuous aspect, are essentially what the imperfect tense represents. There are no specifically "present aorist", that is, present completive forms; however the occasional use of the aorist subjunctive in the role of a future displays how the aorist may be used in reference to completive actions in the "non-past".

The aorist system also distinguishes two voices, active (A) and mediopassive (MP), by different sets of endings. The distinctions are discussed in the next lesson.

8.1 The Aorist Indicative
The endings of the aorist indicative are as follows.

 	 	A	 	MP
1 Sg.	 	-i	 	-ay
2	 	-er	 	-ar
3	 	-	 	-aw
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-akʿ	 	-akʿ
2	 	-ēkʿ, -ikʿ	 	-aykʿ, -arukʿ
3	 	-in	 	-an
The verbs argelum 'I hinder' and nstim 'I sit' illustrate root aorist paradigms. The verbs orsam 'I hunt' and hayim 'I look' illustrate aorists with the suffix -(V)cʿ.

 	 	root, A	 	-Vcʿ, A	 	root, MP	 	-Vcʿ, MP
 	 	argelum	 	orsam	 	nstim	 	hayim
 	 	'hinder'	 	'hunt'	 	'sit'	 	'look'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	argeli	 	orsacʿi	 	nstay	 	hayecʿay
2	 	argeler	 	orsacʿer	 	nstar	 	hayecʿar

3	 	argelin	 	orsacʿin	 	nstan	 	hayecʿan
The ending -arukʿ of the second person plural sometimes shows up as -erukʿ in certain verbs. For example, čanačʿem 'I know' has aorist caneay 'I knew', with 2nd Pl. canerukʿ.

A given root may take endings of both active and mediopassive voices, such as sirem 'I love' and berem 'I carry'.

 	 	-Vcʿ, A	 	-Vcʿ, MP	 	root, A	 	root, MP
 	 	sirem	 	sirim	 	berem	 	berim
 	 	'love'	 	'be loved'	 	'carry'	 	'be carried'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	sirecʿi	 	sirecʿay	 	beri	 	beray
2	 	sirecʿer	 	sirecʿar	 	berer	 	berar
3	 	sireacʿ	 	sirecʿaw	 	eber	 	beraw
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	sirecʿakʿ	 	sirecʿakʿ	 	berakʿ	 	berakʿ
2	 	sirecʿēkʿ, sirecʿikʿ	 	sirecʿaykʿ	 	berēkʿ, berikʿ	 	beraykʿ
3	 	sirecʿin	 	sirecʿan	 	berin	 	beran
Note that forms which would otherwise be monosyllabic take an augment e, hence eber. The augment does not appear when the monosyllable begins with a vowel, e.g. 3 Sg. A ac from the verb acem 'I lead'. In the post-classical period, such forms also gained an augment: ēac. Note also the alternation ea/e, with ea showing in positions where the syllable carries stress, hence sireacʿ. In general, when the stem is subject to vowel alternation, the full grade is displayed in the 3rd Sg.; examples are the following.

 	 	1st Sg.	 	2nd Sg.	 	3rd Sg.
 	 	kl-i 'I swallowed'	 	kl-er	 	ekul
 	 	lcʿ-i 'I filled'	 	lcʿ-er	 	elicʿ
 	 	iǰ-i 'I came down'	 	iǰ-er	 	ēǰ
 	 	anic-i 'I cursed'	 	anic-er	 	anēc
 	 	luc-i 'I loosened'	 	luc-er	 	eloyc
 	 	pʿaxucʿ-i 'I chased'	 	pʿaxucʿ-er	 	pʿaxoycʿ
 	 	kecʿ-i 'I lived'	 	kecʿ-er	 	ekeacʿ
 	 	atecʿ-i 'I hated'	 	atecʿ-er	 	ateacʿ
The last two forms are not examples of the -(V)cʿ aorist suffix, but rather of regular vowel alternation in the verbal root itself: present indicative keam, ateam.

Root aorists in -eay are built on i-stems, e.g. pʿaxeay 'I fled' < *pʿaxi-ay and sarteay 'I startled' < *sarti-ay. Such aorists at times have modified endings in other portions of the aorist system.

8.2 The Aorist Subjunctive
The marker of the aorist subjunctive is -icʿ-, becoming -ycʿ- after a. In unstressed syllables, the i drops. Only the second person plural breaks this pattern, showing -ǰikʿ instead. Thus the aorist subjunctive endings are as follows.

 	 	A	 	MP
1 Sg.	 	-icʿ	 	-aycʿ
2	 	-cʿes	 	-cʿis, -cʿes
3	 	-cʿē	 	-cʿi, -cʿē
 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-cʿukʿ	 	-cʿukʿ
2	 	-ǰikʿ	 	-ǰikʿ
3	 	-cʿen	 	-cʿin, -cʿen
These endings are added to the aorist stem. Note that extended polysyllabic aorist stems change cʿ to s before a consonant. Thus we have the following example paradigms.

 	 	root, A	 	-Vcʿ, A	 	root, MP	 	-Vcʿ, MP
 	 	argelum	 	orsam	 	nstim	 	hayim
 	 	'hinder'	 	'hunt'	 	'sit'	 	'look'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	argelicʿ	 	orsacʿicʿ	 	nstaycʿ	 	hayecʿaycʿ
2	 	argelcʿes	 	orsescʿes	 	nstcʿis	 	hayescʿis
3	 	argelcʿē	 	orsascʿē	 	nstcʿi	 	hayescʿi
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	argelcʿukʿ	 	orsascʿukʿ	 	nstcʿukʿ	 	hayescʿukʿ
2	 	argelǰikʿ	 	orsasǰikʿ	 	nstǰikʿ	 	hayesǰikʿ
3	 	argelcʿen	 	orsascʿen	 	nstcʿin	 	hayescʿin
Monosyllabic stems do not display such dissimilation, e.g. lacʿicʿ, lacʿcʿes, etc.

The alternate mediopassive endings are found for some anomalous verbs and for i-stem aorists. For example, pʿaxeay 'I fled' shows subjunctive forms pʿaxeaycʿ, pʿaxicʿes, pʿaxicʿē, 3rd Pl. pʿaxicʿen.

8.3 The Aorist Imperative
The aorist imperative has only second person forms. The endings are as follows.

 	 	A	 	MP
2 Sg.	 	-	 	-ir, -
2 Pl.	 	-ēkʿ, -ikʿ	 	-arukʿ, -aykʿ
Note that the second person plural forms are the same as those of the aorist indicative. Sample paradigms are given for the verbs berem 'I carry' and sirem 'I love'.

 	 	A	 	MP	 	 	 	A	 	MP
 	 	berem	 	 	 	 	 	sirem	 	 
 	 	'carry'	 	 	 	 	 	'love'	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Sg.	 	ber	 	berir, ber	 	 	 	sirea	 	sireacʿ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Pl.	 	berēkʿ, berikʿ	 	berarukʿ	 	 	 	sirecʿēkʿ, sirecʿikʿ	 	sirecʿarukʿ
The mediopassive ending -ir always occurs in verbs with extended present stems:

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Imper. Sg.	 	Imper. Pl.
 	 	hecanim 'I ride'	 	hecay	 	hecir	 	hecarukʿ
 	 	daṙnam 'I turn'	 	darjay	 	darjir	 	darjarukʿ
 	 	pʿaxčʿim 'I flee'	 	pʿaxeay	 	pʿaxir	 	pʿaxerukʿ
 	 	zgenum 'I dress'	 	zgecʿay	 	zgecʿir	 	zgecʿarukʿ
and occasionally in verbs with present in -anam, aorist -acʿay:

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Imper. Sg.	 	Imper. Pl.
 	 	imanam 'I understand'	 	imacʿay	 	imacʿir, ima	 	imacʿarukʿ
 	 	moṙanam 'I forget'	 	moṙacʿay	 	moṙacʿir, moṙa	 	moṙacʿarukʿ
Otherwise, the second person singular is generally identical to the bare aorist stem. Polysyllabic aorists in -cʿ-, however, have the following tendencies:

(a) -acʿ reduces to -a:

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Imper. Sg.	 	Imper. Pl.
 	 	asem 'I say'	 	asacʿi	 	asa	 	asacʿēkʿ
 	 	hawatam 'I believe'	 	hawatacʿi	 	hawata	 	hawatacʿēkʿ
 	 	yusam 'I hope'	 	yusacʿay	 	yusa	 	yusacʿarukʿ
(b) -ecʿ changes to -ea in the active, to -eacʿ in the mediopassive:

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Imper. Sg.	 	Imper. Pl.
 	 	grem 'I write'	 	grecʿi	 	grea	 	grecʿēkʿ
 	 	hayim 'I look'	 	hayecʿay	 	hayeacʿ	 	hayecʿarukʿ
Monosyllabic stems in -cʿ do not undergo such changes:

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Imper. Sg.	 	Imper. Pl.
 	 	lam 'I cry'	 	lacʿi	 	lacʿ	 	lacʿēkʿ
 	 	keam 'I live'	 	kecʿi	 	keacʿ	 	kecʿēkʿ
 	 	banam 'I open'	 	bacʿi	 	bacʿ	 	bacʿēkʿ
 	 	lnum 'I fill'	 	lcʿi	 	licʿ	 	lcʿēkʿ
Root aorist stems remain unaltered:

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Imper. Sg.	 	Imper. Pl.	 	 
 	 	argelum 'I hinder'	 	argeli	 	argel	 	argelēkʿ	 	 
 	 	hanem	 	'I draw'	 	hani	 	han	 	hanēkʿ
 	 	baṙnam 'I lift'	 	barji	 	barj	 	barjēkʿ	 	 
 	 	arkanem 'I throw'	 	arki	 	ark	 	arkēkʿ	 	 
 	 	nstim 'I sit'	 	nstay	 	nist	 	nstarukʿ	 	 
Also noteworthy are the second person endings -ǰir (Sg.) and -ǰikʿ added to aorist stems to form the so-called cohortative. These parallel the present endings -iǰir and -iǰikʿ added to -em and -im presents. The cohortative forms play a role essentially like an imperative. The verb argelum 'I hinder' illustrates the forms.

 	 	Imperative	 	Cohortative
2 Sg.	 	argel	 	argelǰir
2 Pl.	 	argelēkʿ	 	argelǰikʿ
The difference is perhaps akin to that of Latin imperative as against second person subjunctive: prohibe (imp.) 'hinder!' vs. prohibeas (coh.) 'let you hinder'.

9 Adverbs
There are some general tendencies in the formation of adverbs in Classical Armenian. Adverbs generally derive from two souces: (1) frozen use of oblique cases; (2) special endings. The most common formations are discussed below.

Adverbs of Mode are often formed from

the instrumental case of nouns or adjectives: diwr 'easy' yields the adverb diwraw 'easily'; bun 'nature' yields bnaw 'by nature; absolutely'. There is a particular instrumental ending -ew frozen in its adverbial function: ardar 'just, righteous' yields ardarew 'really'; amen-ayn 'all, every' yields amenewin 'wholly'.
the accusative of adjectives: yankarc 'unexpectedly'; ułił 'directly'.
the ablative with the preposition i: yanpatrasticʿ 'suddenly', from i and anpatrast 'not ready'.
the suffix -pēs, denoting 'type, way', appended to nouns and adjectives: pʿoytʿ 'haste' yields pʿutʿapēs 'quickly'; daṙn 'bitter' yields daṙnapēs 'bitterly'; ays 'this' yields ayspēs 'in this way'; ⁰or 'what?' yields ⁰orpēs 'how?'. Note the form pēspēs 'variously'.
the suffix -abar with the sense 'in the habit of, in the manner of': gazanabar 'in the manner of a beast, wildly' comes from gazan 'wild beast'; ariabar 'valiantly' comes from ari 'brave, valiant'.
the suffixes -arēn or -erēn used for languages: yunarēn 'in Greek' from yoyn 'Greek'; hayerēn 'in Armenian' from hay 'Armenian'; ebrayecʿerēn 'in Hebrew' from ebrayecʿi 'Hebrew'.
Adverbs of Time are often derived from frozen case forms. Examples are aysawr 'today', the accusative of ays awr 'this day'; ayžm 'now', accusative of ays žam 'this time'; vałiw (also i vałiw or i vałiw andr) 'tomorrow', instrumental of vał 'soon'; erek 'yesterday', locative of erek 'evening'; aysu hetew 'from now onward; consequently', instrumental of ays het 'this track, this trail'; orov hetew 'since; because', instrumental of or het 'which track'.

Adverbs of Place generally have the same threefold distinction as the demonstratives (-s, -d, -n), and answer to questions of y⁰o 'to where?', ⁰ur 'where?', and ust⁰i 'from where?'. The following table summarizes the distinction.

 	 	here	 	there	 	over there
to	 	aysr	 	aydr	 	andr
at	 	ast	 	aydr	 	and
from	 	asti, astust	 	ayti	 	anti, andust
There are emphatic forms with the ending -ēn: astēn, aydrēn, andēn 'in the same place'.

One may construct a similar table based upon the distinction 'in', 'out', 'above'.

 	 	inside	 	outside	 	above
to	 	i nerkʿs	 	artakʿs	 	i ver
at	 	i nerkʿoy	 	artakʿoy	 	i veroy, i veray
from	 	i nerkʿust	 	artakʿust	 	i verust
The phrase i vayr 'down', from the word vayr 'field', is often used in opposition to i ver 'above'.

10 Particles
Classical Armenian makes use of several particles. The most common are listed below for convenience.

aha 'lo! behold!'. Interjection.

ayl 'but, rather', typically contrasting opposites, e.g. očʿ eki lucanel , ayl lnul 'I have not come to destroy, but to fulfil'. The form is A Sg. of ayl 'other, another'.

apa 'then, afterwards, later', marking the sequence of events. apa (uremn) 'therefore' may signify logical conclusion, e.g. apa uremn azat en ordikʿn 'therefore the sons are free'. apa 'or' may signify the second of two alternatives. apa 'then' may mark the apodosis ('then'-clause) of a conditional statement.

ard 'now; so, then'. The basic meaning is 'now', but may be used in the continuation of a thought.

baycʿ 'except, but'. The basic sense is 'except': očʿ okʿ i nocʿanē koreaw baycʿ ordin korstean 'no one among them perished, save the son of ruin'. baycʿ 'but' may be used in a limiting sense: hogis yawžar ē baycʿ marmins tkar 'the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak'.

ew 'also, too, and'. Conjunction linking words or clauses. Also found in extended form ews 'also, still, moreover, besides'.

zi 'that, because' with indicative verb, introducing causal statements; 'so that, so as to' with verbs in the subjunctive, introducing result clauses. The form z-i is A Sg. of the relative-interrogative pronoun. It is often closely allied with other adverbs: kʿanzi 'because'; vasn zi 'since'; orpēs zi 'so that', with subjunctive; minčʿ zi 'until, up to'; pʿoxanak zi 'in place of'.

tʿe, etʿe '(quote)', introducing direct speech or a direct question; 'whether, whether...or' introducing dependent or indirect questions, or twofold questions; 'that' with subjunctive, introducing result clauses; 'if' with indicative or subjunctive verb, introducing different types of conditional statements. This particle has a very broad range, with many nuances beyond those mentioned here.

tʿepēt 'although'. It may be followed by a verb in the indicative or subjunctive, according to sense.

ibr, ibrew 'like, as', used for comparison with z and the accusative of the object of comparison, e.g. linicʿikʿ ibrew zastyacs 'you will be as gods'; 'about, approximately' used in apposition with numbers; 'as, as soon as, while, after' with temporal clauses.

isk 'truly, indeed, but'. isk ew isk is used in the sense of 'immediately': ew isk ew isk etes i tesleann 'and immediately he saw in the dream'.

kam 'or', kam...kam 'either...or'. Disjunctive particle. Originally meaning 'as one wants, as you like, as you will'.

minčʿ, minčʿew 'until, up to, as far as, as, during, while, as long as' with finite verb or infinitive, introducing temporal or consecutive statements. It may also be used with i before nouns. The collocation minčʿ čʿew is used in the sense 'before'. minčʿ deṙ is used in the sense 'while, as'.

na 'then'. One also finds na ew 'and also'.

sakayn 'but, however', often used in the sense 'under such conditions'.

kʿan 'than'. Comparative particle, used with z and the accusative of the object of comparison: sirecʿin mardik zxawar aṙawel kʿan zloys 'the men loved the shadow more than the light'; hzawragoyn kʿan zna 'someone stronger than he'.

Lesson 3
Todd B. Krause, John A.C. Greppin, and Jonathan Slocum
The Artashesian Dynasty
Although the Yervandunis had succeeded in securing an independent Armenia, Seleucid influence again began to assert itself when Antiochus III convinced two members of the Yervanduni family to revolt. These two, Artashes and Zareh, succeeded in overthrowing Yervanduni rule, with Artashes taking control of Greater Armenia and Zareh taking Dsopk. Antiochus, however, went too far when he tried to drive the Romans out of Macedonia and Greece. Defeated decisively at Magnesia, Antiochus was forced in 188 B.C. to cede Asia Minor and northwest Syria to the Romans. Seleucid reign was further weakened under Antiochus IV, when Jewish uprisings caused enough instability for the Parthians to gain control of Persia. At the same time Rome lured the states of Armenia, Cappadocia, Commagene, and Pontus away from the Seleucids to create a buffer between Roman holdings and the Parthians.

Upon securing his kingdom, Artashes marked its borders with boundary stones written in Aramaic. He then endeavored to extend his realm, eventually conquering regions belonging to the Medes, Caucasian Albanians, and Iberians. He was repulsed, however, by Dsopk and Lesser Armenia. Within his borders, Artashes distributed land among nobles and established a system of taxation. But the Seleucids eventually quelled the Jewish uprisings in 165 B.C. and attacked Armenia. Antiochus IV captured Artashes, reinstating his reign only under the condition that he pay tribute to the Seleucids. Seleucid power nevertheless entered swiftly into a period of decline, leaving the Arsacid ruler Mithridates I an opportunity to extend Parthian dominion throughout Mesopotamia.

Artavazd I (160 - 115 B.C.) and Tigran I (115 - 95 B.C.), the successors of Artashes, were both subject to Parthian domination, forced to pay tribute and send royal family members as hostages to the Parthian capital at Ctesiphon. When Tigran I died in 95 B.C., his son Tigran II, then a hostage at Ctesiphon, secured his freedom by giving the Parthians a portion of southeastern Armenia. Upon his return, Tigran quickly conquered Dsopk and created a unified Greater Armenia. There was now little separating Tigran's kingdom from the Romans, and so he struck up an alliance with Mithridates of Pontus. Armenia was thus protected from the Romans, and Pontus from the Parthians. This left Tigran free to expand eastward, which he did in 90 B.C. by reconquering the lands he gave to the Parthians. He then turned south to take Commagene, northern Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia, so that Armenia was for a brief time an empire extending from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. Greek and Persian became the languages of the nobility, Persian used mainly for admistrative affairs and Greek for cultural entertainment.

The situation changed drastically with Rome's invasion of Pontus in 74 B.C. Tigran remained loyal to his alliance with Mithridates, resisting the Roman advance. In 69 B.C., Rome turned toward Tigranakert, a major city of the Armenian empire, and took it by force; this destroyed the Armenian hold on Syria and Mesopotamia. Finally Rome sent Pompey to advance on Armenia; when the Parthians simultaneously attacked from the east, Tigran struck a peace treaty with the Romans in 66 B.C. Rome allowed Tigran to maintain his rule of Armenia in order to keep this a buffer region between Roman and Parthian interests. Tigran ruled until his death in 55 B.C.

One of Tigran's sons, Artavazd II, came to the Armenian throne amidst the signs of an inevitable clash between Rome and Parthia. Initially Artavazd attempted to court the favor of Crassus, who was then in charge of the Roman forces in the area. When Crassus failed to take notice, Artavazd shifted his loyalty to the Parthians, a status sealed by the marriage of Artavazd's sister to the Parthian heir-apparent. Artavazd still tried to appear friendly to Rome when Mark Antony took command of Roman forces in the region. But when Armenia refused to commit troops to the Roman effort against the Parthians, Antony blamed Artavazd for his defeat and took the Armenian capital by force in 35 B.C. Artavazd was taken to Egypt and executed.

Artavazd's son, Artashes II, enlisted the aid of the Parthians and regained his country in 30 B.C. For the next several years rulers of the Artashesian dynasty continued to direct Armenia's loyalty back and forth between Rome and Parthia. Finally the Artashesian dynasty came to an end around 10 A.D., and Armenia fell into Roman hands.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The History of Armenia, by Faustos Buzand, is also called The Epic Histories, by Pseudo Fawstos. It covers nearly sixty years of Christian Armenia's earliest history, from ca. 330 to 387, from the late Arsacid dynasty to the partition of Armenia between Byzantium and Sasanian Iran. The author deals with the political issues of that period, and with the development of Armenian Christianity. This reading is taken from Book IV, Chapter 5.

Translation
Then, because of the covenant of peace -- the alliance of unity, which was between the realm of the Armenians and the emperor of the Greeks -- it was appropriate for the king of the Armenians to send thither with great pomp, so that the great catholicos of the Armenians, Nerses himself, -- and to furnish him ten satraps of the greatest Armenians -- so that he should go and they renew the treaty of peace and accord between the emperor and themselves. They then set out, travelled, and reached the imperial palace of the kings of the Greeks. At about that time in matters of faith the great king of the Greeks, Valens, was under the sway of heresy of the Arians' sect. Then, when the king saw them, first he honored them with marvellous glory and great splendor. Then it happened that the only son of the emperor -- that one was truly considered his progeny -- had lapsed into the throes of a severe illness. On account of making prayers over the child, the king thereupon urged Nerses the holy catholicos of the Armenians.
[Nerses continues with a discussion of the content of the orthodox faith, and makes the son's healing dependent on the Arian king's acceptance of this doctrine. The following continues with the king's reply.]
And when the king heard all this -- for, while he was still speaking before him, he remained but silent, having set foot over foot, elbow on knee, and hand on chin -- he sat thus until he finished speaking all his words. And the notary archon's stenographers who were before the king transcribed this. Then the king fell fiercely into a rage, and gave an order to bind fast with iron chains Nerses the holy archbishop of the Armenians, and to cast him into prison.
Grammar
11 Mixed Nominal Declension
11.1 Substantives with -n in the Plural Only
These declensions are followed by both nouns and adjectives. Several nouns follow an i- or u-declension. Adjectives of this type display an -r in the nominative and accusative which drops in the remaining forms. The plural forms of both nouns and adjectives display stems in -n. The substantives may have either two or three stems within the declension. The noun kʿar 'stone', with stems kʿar-/kʿarin-/kʿaran-, illustrates the i-declension; paṙaw 'old woman', with stems paṙaw-/paṙawun-/paṙawan- illustrates the u-declension. Adjective declensions are illustrated by pʿokʿr 'small', stems pʿokʿ-/pʿokʿun-; and barjr 'high', stems barj-/barjun-/barjan-. These follow the u-declension.

 	 	i-decl.	 	u-decl.	 	u-decl.	 	u-decl.
 	 	T-i, Nt + T-n, Ht-A	 	T-u, Ht + T-n, Ht-B	 	T-u, Ht + T-n, Ht-B	 	T-u, Ht + T-n, Ht-B

I	 	kʿariwkʿ	 	paṙawumbkʿ	 	pʿokʿunbkʿ	 	barjumbkʿ
11.2 Substantives with -n in the Singular Only
Certain nouns display -n only in the singular forms. The plural then follows the a-declension, sometimes the i-declension. Nouns of this type may typically have two or three stems within the paradigm. The nouns jeṙn 'hand', stems jeṙn-/jeṙin-/jeṙ-; serund 'breed, race', stems serund-/serdean-; and otn 'foot', stems otn-/otin-/ot-, illustrate the paradigms.

 	 	a-decl.	 	a-decl.	 	i-decl.
 	 	T-n, Ht-A + T-a	 	T-n, Ht-A + T-a	 	T-n, Nt-B1 + T-a
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	jeṙn	 	serund	 	otn
Ac	 	jeṙn	 	serund	 	otn
G	 	jeṙin	 	serdean	 	otin
D	 	jeṙin	 	serdean	 	otin
L	 	jeṙin	 	serdean	 	otin
Ab	 	jeṙanē	 	serdenē	 	otanē
I	 	jeṙamb	 	serdeamb	 	otamb
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	jeṙkʿ	 	serundkʿ	 	otkʿ
Ac	 	jeṙs	 	serunds	 	ots
G	 	jeṙacʿ	 	serundacʿ	 	oticʿ
D	 	jeṙacʿ	 	serundacʿ	 	oticʿ
L	 	jeṙs	 	serunds	 	ots
Ab	 	jeṙacʿ	 	serundacʿ	 	oticʿ
I	 	jeṙawkʿ	 	serundawkʿ	 	otiwkʿ
Note the singular forms Ab jeṙanē, otanē and I jeṙamb, otamb wherein a precedes the nasal instead of i.

11.3 Anomalous Nouns
Certain common nouns display enough peculiarity of declension that they do not fit easily within the patterns already mentioned. These are collected here. The nouns hayr 'father', kʿoyr 'sister', and awr '(24-hour) day' are declined as follows.

 	 	hayr	 	kʿoyr	 	awr
 	 	'father'	 	'sister'	 	'(24-hour) day'
 	 	T-r, Nt-B

Ab	 	hawrē	 	kʿeṙē	 	awrē (< awurē)
I	 	harb	 	kʿerb	 	awurb
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	harkʿ	 	kʿerkʿ	 	awurkʿ
Ac	 	hars	 	kʿers	 	awurs

Ab	 	harcʿ	 	kʿercʿ	 	awurcʿ
I	 	harbkʿ	 	kʿerbkʿ	 	awurbkʿ
The nouns mayr 'mother' and ełbayr 'brother' follow the pattern of hayr.

The nouns nu 'daughter-in-law', gewł 'village', and tiw 'day(light)' are declined as follows.

 	 	nu	 	gewł	 	tiw
 	 	'daughter-in-law'	 	'village'	 	'day(light)'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	nu	 	gewł	 	tiw

Ab	 	nua(n)cʿ	 	giwłicʿ	 	-
I	 	nuawkʿ	 	giwłiwkʿ	 	-
Below are the paradigms of the nouns ayr 'man, husband', kin 'woman, wife', tēr 'lord', tikin 'lady'. Note that tēr is a contracted form of te(y)-ayr or ti-ayr and thus parallels tikin in construction.

 	 	ayr	 	kin	 	tēr	 	tikin
 	 	'man'	 	'woman'	 	'lord'	 	'lady'

I	 	arambkʿ	 	kanambkʿ	 	terambkʿ	 	tiknambkʿ
The two nouns akn and unkn require special attention because of the fact that their meanings change depending on what form their plurals take. Specifically, akn may have three separate meanings: (1) 'eye', (2) 'source', (3) 'gem'. In the plural, each meaning is associated with a distinct stem. All three meanings, however, are associated with the same forms in the singular. Thus akn has the following declension.

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl. (1) 'eye'	 	Pl. (2) 'source'	 	Pl. (3) 'gem'
N	 	akn	 	ačʿkʿ	 	akunkʿ	 	akankʿ
Ac	 	akn	 	ačʿs	 	akuns	 	akans
G	 	akan	 	ačʿacʿ	 	akancʿ	 	akanocʿ
D	 	akan	 	ačʿacʿ	 	akancʿ	 	akanocʿ
L	 	akan	 	ačʿs	 	akuns	 	akans
Ab	 	ak(a)nē	 	ačʿacʿ	 	akancʿ	 	akanocʿ
I	 	akamb	 	ačʿawkʿ	 	akambkʿ	 	akanovkʿ
A similar situation obtains for the noun unkn. This noun has a twofold semantic split in the plural: (1) 'ear', (2) 'handle'. The declension is as follows.

 	 	Sg.	 	Pl. (1) 'ear'	 	Pl. (2) 'handle'
N	 	unkn	 	akanǰkʿ	 	unkunkʿ
Ac	 	unkn	 	akanǰs	 	unkuns
G	 	unkan	 	akanǰacʿ	 	unkancʿ
D	 	unkan	 	akanǰacʿ	 	unkancʿ
L	 	unkan	 	akanǰs	 	unkuns
Ab	 	unk(a)nē	 	akanǰacʿ	 	unkancʿ
I	 	unkamb	 	akanǰawkʿ	 	unkambkʿ
12 Personal Pronouns and Possessives
12.1 Personal Pronouns
The personal pronouns es 'I' and du 'thou' are the only substantives in Classical Armenian whose nominative and accusative forms differ. Their declensions are as follows.

 	 	es	 	du
 	 	'I'	 	'thou'
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	es	 	du
Ac	 	is	 	kʿez
G	 	im	 	kʿo
D	 	imj	 	kʿez
L	 	is	 	kʿez
Ab	 	inēn, injēn	 	kʿēn, kʿezēn
I	 	inew	 	kʿew
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	mekʿ	 	dukʿ
Ac	 	mez	 	jez
G	 	mer	 	jer
D	 	mez	 	jez
L	 	mez	 	jez
Ab	 	mēnǰ, mezēn	 	jēnǰ, jezēn
I	 	mewkʿ	 	jewkʿ
The secondary ablative forms may be used in an intensive role. When used as intensives, these ablative forms need not be in the same case as the pronoun which they emphasize. They do, however, agree in number. For example:

orpēs ew dukʿ isk jezēn vkayecʿēkʿ 'as you yourselves have borne witness';
es injēn gitem 'I myself know'.
12.2 Reflexive and Intensive Pronouns
For the third person Classical Armenian has a separate reflexive pronoun iwr '-self, -selves'. The pronoun inkʿn '-self, -selves' may be used as a reflexive for all of the first, second, and third persons. These are comparable to Latin se and ipse respectively. inkʿn may be used in an intensive sense; there is an emphatic form inkʿnin, derived by adding the suffix -in. In addition to these pronouns, the noun anjn 'person, self' may be used in a reflexive role. The paradigms for iwr, inkʿn, and anjn are as follows.

 	 	iwr	 	inkʿn	 	anjn
 	 	refl. pron.	 	refl./intens. pron.	 	refl. noun
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-	 	inkʿn	 	anjn
Ac	 	-	 	inkʿn	 	anjn
G	 	iwr	 	inkʿean	 	anjin
D	 	iwr	 	inkʿean	 	anjin
L	 	iwr	 	inkʿean	 	anjin
Ab	 	iwrmē	 	inkʿenē	 	anjnē
I	 	iwrew, iwreaw, iwreamb	 	inkʿeamb	 	anjamb
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-	 	inkʿeankʿ	 	anjinkʿ
Ac	 	iwreans	 	inkʿeans	 	anjins
G	 	iwreancʿ	 	inkʿeancʿ	 	anjancʿ
D	 	iwreancʿ	 	inkʿeancʿ	 	anjancʿ
L	 	iwreans	 	inkʿeans	 	anjins
Ab	 	iwreancʿ	 	inkʿeancʿ	 	anjancʿ
I	 	iwreambkʿ	 	inkʿeambkʿ	 	anjambkʿ
Note the genitive of iwr may be used with participles as the subject, e.g. zor iwr čʿēr gorceal '(the sins) which he had not committed'. The subject of the relative clause is the same as that of the main clause.

The reflexive inkʿn is found in the phrase ays inkʿn 'that is, really'.

The noun anjn is often found with a possessive pronoun or adjective: yaytneacʿ zanjn iwr 'he revealed himself'; but this is not always the situation: očʿ unikʿ keans yanjins 'you do not have life in yourselves'.

12.3 Possessive Pronouns and Adjectives
The possessive pronouns are supplied by the genitive case of the corresponding personal pronouns, im 'mine, of me'; kʿo 'thine, of you'; nora 'his, of him; her, of her; its, of it'; iwr 'of him-, her-, it-self' (reflexive); mer 'of us'; jez 'of you'; nocʿa 'of them'; iwreancʿ 'of themselves' (reflexive). These then form the basis for a series of possessive adjectives, whose declensions follow.

 	 	im	 	kʿo	 	nora	 	iwr	 	mer	 	jer	 	nocʿa	 	[iwreancʿ]
 	 	'my'	 	'thy'	 	'his'	 	'his'(refl.)	 	'our'	 	'your' (pl.)	 	'their'	 	'their' (refl.)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	im	 	kʿo	 	nora	 	iwr	 	mer	 	jer	 	nocʿa	 	[iwreancʿ]
Ac	 	im	 	kʿo	 	nora	 	iwr	 	mer	 	jer	 	nocʿa	 	 
G	 	imoy	 	kʿoyoy, kʿoy	 	norayoy	 	iwroy	 	meroy	 	jeroy	 	nocʿayoy	 	 
D	 	imum	 	kʿum	 	norayum	 	iwrum	 	merum	 	jerum	 	nocʿayum	 	 
L	 	imum	 	kʿum	 	norayum	 	iwrum	 	merum	 	jerum	 	nocʿayum	 	 
Ab	 	immē	 	kʿumē	 	norayoy	 	iwrmē	 	mermē	 	jermē	 	nocʿayoy	 	 
I	 	imov	 	kʿuov	 	norayov	 	iwrov	 	merov	 	jerov	 	nocʿayov	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	imkʿ	 	kʿoykʿ	 	noraykʿ	 	iwr	 	merkʿ	 	jerkʿ	 	nocʿaykʿ	 	[iwreancʿ]
Ac	 	ims	 	kʿoys	 	norays	 	iwr	 	mers	 	jers	 	nocʿays	 	 
G	 	imocʿ	 	kʿoyocʿ, kʿocʿ	 	norayocʿ, norayicʿ	 	iwrocʿ	 	merocʿ	 	jerocʿ	 	nocʿayocʿ, nocʿayicʿ	 	 
D	 	imocʿ	 	kʿoyocʿ	 	norayocʿ, norayicʿ	 	iwrocʿ	 	merocʿ	 	jerocʿ	 	nocʿayocʿ, nocʿayicʿ	 	 
L	 	ims	 	kʿoys	 	norays	 	iwrum	 	mers	 	jers	 	nocʿays	 	 
Ab	 	imocʿ	 	kʿoyocʿ	 	norayocʿ, norayicʿ	 	iwrocʿ	 	merocʿ	 	jerocʿ	 	nocʿayocʿ, nocʿayicʿ	 	 
I	 	imovkʿ	 	kʿoyovkʿ	 	norayovkʿ, norayiwkʿ	 	iwrovkʿ	 	merovkʿ	 	jerovkʿ	 	nocʿayovkʿ, nocʿayiwkʿ	 	 
Note that the NAcL Pl. forms of iwr are the same as the singular. The expected forms iwrkʿ and iwrs are found instead as substantives: yiwrs ekn ew iwrkʿn zna očʿ ənkalan 'he came to his own and his own did not receive him.'

Examples are jeṙamb iwrov 'with his own hand', es očʿ inčʿ yanjnē immē xawsim 'I say nothing by myself.' Nouns found in the plural with singular meanings often take singular possessive adjectives: jawrēns kʿum 'in thy law'.

13.2 Anomalous and Suppletive Verbs
Although most verbs obey the above-outlined categories regarding present and aorist classification, there are some verbs that depart from the regular formations. The most notable among these anomalous verbs are collected here. In this section, suppletion is treated as an extreme form of irregularity. The irregularities are broken down into three major categories and examples listed under each.

(a) Irregular stem contrast without inflectional peculiarities

Verbs in this category inflect normally, though the present/aorist stem contrast does not fall into the patterns above.

 	 	Present	 	Aorist
 	 	harkanem 'I strike'	 	hari
 	 	yancʿanem 'I trespass'	 	yancʿeay
 	 	baṙnam 'I raise'	 	barji
 	 	daṙnam 'I (re)turn'	 	darjay
 	 	čanačʿem (< *canačʿem) 'I know'	 	caneay
 	 	əmpem 'I drink'	 	arbi
 	 	unim 'I take hold, have'	 	kalay
(b) Irregular stem contrast with peculiar forms in the imperative and/or aorist subjunctive

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Aor. Subj.	 	Imperative
 	 	aṙnem 'I do, make'	 	arari	 	araricʿ, arascʿes, ...	 	Sg. ara
 	 	tanim 'I carry'	 	taray	 	-	 	tar, taraykʿ
 	 	yaṙnem 'I rise'	 	yareay	 	-	 	ari, arikʿ
 	 	ertʿam 'I go'	 	čʿogay	 	ertʿaycʿ, ertʿicʿes, ...	 	-
 	 	mełančʿem 'I sin'	 	mełay	 	małaycʿ, mełicʿes, ...	 	-
 	 	lsem 'I hear'	 	luay	 	luaycʿ, luicʿes, ...	 	lur, luarukʿ
 	 	utem 'I eat'	 	keray (3 Sg. eker, keraw)	 	keraycʿ, kericʿes, ...	 	ker, keraykʿ
(c) Irregular inflection in the aorist group generally

Present	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	gam 'I come'	 	tam 'I give'	 	dnem 'I put'	 	linim 'I become'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Aor. Ind.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	eki	 	etu	 	edi	 	ełē
2	 	ekir	 	etur	 	edir	 	ełer
3	 	ekn	 	et	 	ed	 	ełew
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	ekakʿ	 	tuakʿ	 	edakʿ	 	ełeakʿ
2	 	ekikʿ	 	etukʿ	 	edikʿ	 	ełēkʿ
3	 	ekin	 	etum	 	edin	 	ełen
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Aor. Subj.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	ekicʿ	 	tacʿ	 	edicʿ	 	ełecʿ
2	 	eke(s)cʿes	 	tacʿes	 	dicʿes	 	licʿis (ełicʿis)
3	 	eke(s)cʿē	 	tacʿē	 	dicʿē	 	licʿi (ełicʿi)
 	 	etc.	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Imperative	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
2 Sg.	 	ek	 	tur	 	dir	 	ler (ełiǰir)
2 Pl.	 	ekaykʿ	 	tukʿ	 	dikʿ	 	lerukʿ (ełerukʿ)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Participle	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N A Sg.	 	ekeal	 	tueal	 	edeal	 	leal (ełeal)
The conjugation of linim parallels that of dnem. The augmented forms ełicʿis, ełicʿi, etc. are later developments which eventually gave rise to a new present form ełanim.

The aorist subjunctive and aorist imperative forms of em 'I am' are supplied by the forms licʿis, etc. and ler, lerukʿ of the verb linim 'I become'.

14 The Passive Voice
14.1 Passive Voice in the Present System
In Classical Armenian transitive verbs occur in both active and passive contructions. The distinction between active and passive, however, is not universally distinguished through morphology. That is to say, the contrast between active forms and passive forms does not hold throughout the Classical Armenian verbal system. In the present indicative, verbs of the e-conjugation may form a passive by changing the stem vowel from e to i, e.g. varem 'I lead' vs. varim 'I am led'; čanačʿem zimsn ew čanačʿim yimocʿn 'I know my own and I am known by my own'. This distinction is in keeping with the distribution of verbs between the e- and i-conjugations, since most of the verbs in the e-conjugation are transitive, most in the i-conjugation intransitive. The e-/i- manner of active/passive contrast has been extended to the prohibitive and to the present subjunctive. Thus one finds the following contrast pattern.

 	 	Active	 	Passive
Pres. Indic.	 	varem, -es, -ē, ... 'I lead'	 	varim, -is, -i, ... 'I am led, I behave'
Prohibitive	 	mi varer, -ēkʿ 'do not lead'	 	mi varir, -ikʿ 'do not behave'
Pres. Subj.	 	varicʿem, -es, -ē, ... 'I shall lead'	 	varicʿim, -is, -i, ... 'I shall be led, I shall behave'
Such distinction is lost in the imperfect: since e-conjugation verbs follow the same imperfect paradigm as i-conjugation verbs, the distinction between active and passive is lost in this tense. Thus the active varem 'I lead' and the passive varim 'I am led' both have imperfect varei, -eir, -ēr, ... 'I was leading, I was being led'. Compare patmein zbann Astuacoy 'they proclaimed the word of God' and patmein bankʿs aysokʿik 'all these things were told'.

Verbs of the a- and u-conjugations, and verbs which are inherently of the i-conjugation, do not form passives by such vowel substitution. These verbs make no formal distinction between active and passive throughout the entire present system:

 	 	 	 	Active Meaning	 	Passive Meaning
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	hamarim	 	'I regard'	 	'I am regarded'
 	 	banam	 	'I open'	 	'I am opened'
 	 	argelum	 	'I hinder'	 	'I am hindered'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Imperfect	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	banayi	 	'I was opening'	 	'I was being opened'
 	 	argelui	 	'I was hindering'	 	'I was being hindered'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Subjunctive	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	hamaricʿim	 	'I shall regard'	 	'I shall be regarded'
 	 	argelucʿum	 	'I shall hinder'	 	'I shall be hindered'
14.2 The Aorist System and Mediopassive
The aorist system maintains a morphological distinction between active and passive. Regular alternation of endings displays the voice contrast:

 	 	Present	 	Aor. Active	 	Aor. Passive
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Indicative	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	pʿorjem 'I tempt'	 	pʿorjecʿi 'I tempted'	 	pʿorjecʿay 'I was tempted'
 	 	patmem 'I tell'	 	patmecʿin 'they told'	 	patmecʿan '(things) were told'
 	 	argelum 'I hinder'	 	argel 'he hindered'	 	argelaw 'he was hindered'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Subjunctive	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	pʿorjicʿem 'I shall tempt'	 	pʿorjecʿicʿ 'I shall tempt'	 	pʿorjecʿaycʿ 'I shall be tempte'
 	 	argelicʿum 'I shall hinder'	 	argelcʿen 'they will hinder'	 	argelcʿin 'they will be hindered'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Imperative	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	(mi) mrkter '(don't) baptize'	 	mrktea 'baptize'	 	mrkteacʿ 'be baptized'
 	 	(mi) luanaykʿ '(don't) wash, (don't) wash yourselves'	 	luacʿēkʿ 'wash'	 	luacʿarukʿ 'wash yourselves'
There are, however, forms which are the same in both active and passive. Such forms are the aorist indicative first person plural, e.g. pʿorjecʿakʿ 'we tempted, we were tempted'; the aorist subjunctive first person plural, e.g. argelcʿukʿ 'we shall hinder, we shall be hindered' and second person plural, e.g. pʿorjesǰikʿ 'you will tempt, you will be tempted'.

Some transitive verbs are found only with passive forms in the aorist system. These forms are therefore ambiguous when taken out of context; they may have active meaning and take an object, or have true passive (and therefore intransitive) meaning. For this reason, the term mediopassive is often used instead of 'passive' to describe the non-active forms of aorist conjugation. Verbs which are so found with only mediopassive endings in the aorist typically have presents in -im, -anam, and -num. Below are examples of some verbs that distinguish active and passive forms in the aorist, and some that have only mediopassive forms.

 	 	Present	 	Aorist Active	 	Aor. Mediopassive	 	Aor. Passive
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	banam 'I open/am opened'	 	bacʿi 'I opened'	 	 	 	bacʿay 'I was opened'
 	 	argelum 'I hinder/am hindered'	 	argeli 'I hindered'	 	 	 	argelay 'I was hindered'
 	 	hamarim 'I regard/am regarded'	 	 	 	hamarecʿay 'I regarded/was regarded'	 	 
 	 	moṙanam 'I forget/am forgotten'	 	 	 	moṙacʿay 'I forgot/was forgotten'	 	 
 	 	əntʿeṙnu 'he reads/(something) is read'	 	 	 	əntʿercʿaw 'he read/(something) was read'	 	 
14.3 General Notes on Passive Usage
The active/passive contrast is not morphologically distinguished in non-finite verb forms, i.e. the infinitive, verbal adjectives, participle. These forms may have either active or passive meaning, determined by context: pʿorjeal i Satanayē 'tempted by Satan'; haneal zna 'having drawn him'.

When morphology does not distinguish voice contrast, ambiguity is often avoided by one of two means: (1) stem substitution, e.g. hełu 'he pours' vs. hełani '(something) is poured'; (2) compound tenses, e.g. bereal linei, lineir, linēr, ... 'I was being carried' vs. berei, bereir, berēr, ... 'I was carrying/was being carried'.

In passive statements, agents of the action are treated differently depending on whether they be animate or inanimate. When the agent is a

person, it is signified by the preposition i + Ablative;
thing, it is placed in the Instrumental.
For example, mrktein i nmanē 'they were baptized by him'; ahiw mecaw tagnapein 'they were struck with fear'.

15 Negation
The particle očʿ is used to negate declarative and interrogative statements. The particle mi is used in negative wishes, requests, commands and final clauses. The particle očʿ, when placed just before the verb, is shortened to čʿ- and written together with the verb: čʿē 'he is not'; čʿtesanein 'they did not see'.

Arsacid Reign
During the first century A.D., Armenia was a pendulum swinging between Rome and Parthia. When Vologeses I, an Arsacid, finally took the Parthian throne in 51 A.D., he took advantage of Armenian revolts against Roman rule to occupy Armenia and set his younger brother Trdat (Tiridates) on the throne. The Roman emperor Nero responded by sending Corbulo, his general, to retake Armenia. The venture succeeded, and, when Trdat fled to Persia, Nero installed Tigranes, a descendant of Herod the Great, as ruler of Armenia. Vologeses again attempted to take Armenia in 62 A.D.; he managed to drive back the Romans, but did not secure his hold on Armenia until 64 A.D., when an agreement was struck whereby Dsopk and Greater Armenia were to be ruled by members of the Arsacid line of Parthia, but would receive their crowns from Rome. In 66 B.C. Trdat received his crown in Rome and so began the Parthian Arsacid, or Arshakuni, rule of Armenia.

Under Arsacid rule, Armenia received a constant influx of noble families from the Parthian empire, particularly from Persia. Persian and Parthian became common languages in the upper echelons of society, and many Persian loanwords entered Armenian during this period. A feudal social structure was introduced, where high-ranking noble families were granted hereditary administrative positions and fiefdoms in return for military service. This created a hierarchy within the nobility, out of which a king would be chosen as chief of the nobles.

It was the Roman emperor Trajan who finally broke the treaty with Parthia by invading Armenia in 114 A.D. Trajan pushed farther and eventually took the Parthian capital Ctesiphon in 116 A.D., but with his death in 117 A.D. and the rise of Hadrian to the Roman throne, the compromise with the Parthians was restored and the Parthian Vagharsh I was placed in charge of Armenia. He ruled Armenia until 140 A.D. After a few intervening Roman and Persian rulers, the Parthian prince Vagharsh II assumed the throne of Armenia in 186 A.D. In 191 A.D. he assumed the Persian throne and named his son Khosrov I to the Armenian throne. Khosrov was subsequently captured by the Romans, who installed one of their own to take charge of Armenia. However the Armenians themselves revolted against their Roman overlords, and, in a new Rome-Parthia compromise, Khosrov's son, Trdat II (217 - 252 A.D.), was made king of Armenia.

The political situation in Parthia began to decline and a smallpox outbreak left the economy so weak that in 224 A.D. Ardeshir overthrew the Arsacids and began the new Sasanid dynasty. The Sasanids were determined to restore the old glory of Achaemenid Persia, making Zoroastrianism the state religion and claiming Armenia as part of the empire. To preserve the autonomy of Arshakuni rule in Armenia, Trdat II sought friendly relations with Rome. This was an unfortunate choice, because the Sasanid king Shapur I (240 - 270 A.D.) defeated the Romans and struck a peace with the emperor Philip, whereby Rome acquiesced to paying tribute and relinquishing control of Greater Armenia. In 252 A.D. Shapur invaded Armenia and, forcing Trdat to flee, installed his own son Hurmazd on the Armenian throne. When Shapur died in 270 A.D., Hurmazd took the Persian throne and his brother Narseh ruled Armenia in his stead. Under Diocletian, Rome tried to install Khosrov II as ruler of Armenia, and between 279 and 287 A.D. he was in possession of the western parts of Armenian territory. But the Sasanids stirred some nobles to revolt, killing Khosrov in the process. When Narseh left to take the Persian throne in 293 A.D., Khosrov's murderer was installed on the Armenian throne. Rome nevertheless defeated Narseh in 298 A.D., and Khosrov's son Trdat III regained control of Armenia with the support of Roman soldiers.

The Christian Religion in Armenia
Christianity, as a marginalized religion, seems to have spread to Armenia as early as the first century A.D. Its presence in Armenia continued to grow over the following two centuries. But the Sasanid sanctioning of Zoroastrianism to the exclusion of all other religions threatened this situation. In the Roman provinces, however, the emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan, issued in 313 A.D., made tolerance for the Christian religion into law. Rome being Armenia's strongest ally, this edict and the desire to resist the Sasanid fervor for Zoroastrianism probably impelled Armenia to become the first nation to adopt Christianity as its official religion. This likely happened around 315 A.D. (though tradition usually places the event around 301 A.D.), roughly sixty-five years before the Roman empire adopted Christianity.

Trdat is said to have been baptized by an ordained Christian named Gregory, whom he chanced upon in Caesarea before he reclaimed the throne of Armenia. When the organization of the Armenian Church was established under a feudal system, it was the family of this Gregory, later called the Illuminator, which inherited the position of catholicos, or supreme patriarch. Other nobles were typically given positions as bishops.

In 325 A.D., the emperor Constantine called the Council of Nicea, at which Gregory's son Aristakes represented Armenia. At the coucil there was debate over the position of Arius, who maintained that Christ was not of the same substance as God and therefore not divine, and of Bishops Alexander and Athanasius of Alexandria, who maintained that the substance of God and Christ was the same. The council rejected Arianism, but Constantine gave credence to the Arian views. The Armenian kings followed the models of the Byzantine rulers in espousing the Arian doctrine, putting them at odds with their own clergy. The issue was only put to rest in 381 A.D. when the emperor Theodosius accepted the ruling of the Council at Constantinople, in which the Athanasian stance was confirmed.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The History of the Life and Death of the Holy Teacher Mesrop, by Koriwn, is a quite brief biography of the spiritual leader and inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Mesrop lived from 361 to 440 A.D. Little is known of Koriwn, the biographer, or the date of the biography, but it surely was written after 440, and before 460, the year of the death of Koriwn. It is perhaps the earliest original writing in Classical Armenian. This reading is taken from Books V and VI.

Translation
And thus he was caught and surrounded by vile spirits and fell into torrents of thoughts about what sort of escape he might find from those affairs. And when he had spent many days there upon this, he rose up and forthwith approached the holy Catholicos of greater Armenia, whose name was known as Sahak, whom he found willing, having acceded to this concern. And thus inclined, assembled together, they rose up with powerful prayers to God for obtaining Christ-borne salvation for all the souls; and they continued to do this for many days. Then it occurred to them, granted by benevolent God, to collect the patriotic counsel of the blessed monks and to obtain letters of the alphabet for the Armenian people; having devoted themselves to a great examination of experiment and investigation, and having endured great labors, they then made an announcement of their own searching to the king of the Armenians, whose name was called Vramshapuh. Then the king told them about a certain man called Daniel by name, an Assyrian bishop of noble origin, who had elsewhere devised letters of the alphabet for the Armenian language. And when this was related to them by the king about the writing from Daniel, they prompted the king to take care according to their needs. And by decree he sent someone, Vahrich by name, to an elderly man whose name they called Habel, who was an acquaintance of the Assyrian bishop Daniel.
Grammar
16 Reciprocal, Collective and Distributive Pronouns
16.1 Reciprocal Pronouns
There are two reciprocal pronouns, mimeans and irears, both meaning 'each other, one another'. mimeans is the more common pronoun. These are found only in the plural, and only in oblique cases. Their declensions are as follows.

N Pl.	 	mimeans	 	irears
Ac	 	mimeans	 	irears
G	 	mimeancʿ	 	ireracʿ
D	 	mimeancʿ	 	ireracʿ
L	 	mimeans	 	irears
Ab	 	mimeancʿ	 	ireracʿ
I	 	mimeambkʿ	 	irerawkʿ
Note the change ea > e in the accusative, locative, and instrumental forms.

Examples are ew hražarecʿakʿ i mimeancʿ 'and we took leave of each other'; zi siricʿēkʿ zmimeans 'that you may love each other'; ein hakaṙakkʿ ireracʿ 'they were opposites to each other'.

16.2 Collective Pronouns
A collective suffix -kʿean, chiefly used with the numerals, is also used with the adjectives amen 'all' and bolor 'the entire' to form collective pronouns. These new pronouns, amenekʿean 'everyone, all the individuals' and bolorekʿean 'all together', have only plural forms.

 	 	amenekʿean	 	bolorekʿean
 	 	'everyone, all individuals'	 	'all together'
N Pl.	 	amenekʿean, amenekʿin	 	bolorekʿean, bolorekʿin

16.3 Distributive Pronoun
The word iwrakʿančʿiwr 'each individually' is used in a distributive sense both as an adjective and as a substantive. As a substantive it is usually followed by okʿ. Examples are kalan ziwrakʿančʿiwr išxanutʿiwn 'they held each one his own principality'; ew na iwrakʿančʿiwr umekʿ i nocʿanē dnēr jeṙs 'and he placed hands on each one of them'.

17 Numerals
17.1 Cardinal Numbers
The numbers mi 'one', erku 'two', erekʿ 'three', and čʿorkʿ 'four' are adjectives which are declined whether preceding or following the noun they modify. Of course mi occurs only in the singular and is sometimes used as the indefinite adjective 'a, an' when placed after the noun: ayr mi 'a man'. The numbers erku, erek, and čʿorkʿ occur only in the plural. Their declensions are as follows.

 	 	mi	 	erku	 	erekʿ	 	čʿorkʿ
 	 	'one'	 	'two'	 	'three'	 	'four'
N	 	mi	 	erku, erkukʿ	 	erekʿ	 	čʿorkʿ
Ac	 	mi	 	erkus	 	eris	 	čʿors
G	 	mioy, mioǰ	 	erkucʿ	 	ericʿ	 	čʿoricʿ
D	 	mium, mioǰ	 	erkucʿ	 	ericʿ	 	čʿoricʿ
L	 	mium, mioǰ	 	erkus	 	eris	 	čʿors
Ab	 	mioy, mioǰē	 	erkucʿ	 	ericʿ	 	čʿoricʿ
I	 	miov	 	erkukʿ	 	eriwkʿ	 	čʿoriwkʿ
The numerals 5 through 10 remain uninflected in the N Ac L, and are usually only declined in the other cases when they follow the noun they qualify. Their declensions are as follows.

 	 	hing	 	vecʿ	 	ewtʿn	 	utʿ	 	inn	 	tasn
 	 	5	 	6	 	7	 	8	 	9	 	10
N Pl.	 	hing	 	vecʿ	 	ewtʿn	 	utʿ	 	inn	 	tasn
Ac	 	hing	 	vecʿ	 	ewtʿn	 	utʿ	 	inn	 	tasn
G	 	hngicʿ, hngacʿ	 	vecʿicʿ	 	ewtʿancʿ	 	utʿicʿ	 	ənnicʿ, inuncʿ	 	tasancʿ, tasin
D	 	hngicʿ, hngacʿ	 	vecʿicʿ	 	ewtʿancʿ	 	utʿicʿ	 	ənnicʿ, inuncʿ	 	tasancʿ, tasin
L	 	hing	 	vecʿ	 	ewtʿn	 	utʿ	 	inn	 	tasn
Ab	 	hngicʿ, hngacʿ	 	vecʿicʿ	 	ewtʿancʿ	 	utʿicʿ	 	ənnicʿ, inuncʿ	 	tasancʿ, tasin
I	 	hngiwkʿ, kngawkʿ	 	vecʿiwkʿ	 	ewtʿambkʿ	 	utʿiwkʿ	 	ənniwkʿ, inambkʿ, innambkʿ	 	tasambkʿ, tasamb
All remaining numbers are typically not declined unless used as substantives, and if inflected, only in the G D Ab I. When declined, the numbers 11 through 16 follow the declension of hing, and 17 through 19 follow tasn -- that is, only tasn is inflected. The numbers 11 through 19 are listed below.

11. metasan, metasanicʿ
12. erkotasan, -icʿ
13. erekʿtasan, -icʿ
14. čʿorekʿtasan, -icʿ
15. hngetasan, -icʿ
16. veštasan, -icʿ
17. ewtʿn ew tasn, ewtʿn ew tasancʿ
18. utʿ ew tasn, ... tasancʿ
19. inn ew tasn, ... tasancʿ
The tens, when declined, have have G D Ab Sg. -i, Pl. -icʿ and I Sg. -iw, Pl. -iwkʿ. After 20, the tens are formed by means of the suffix -sun. The tens are listed below.

20. kʿsan
30. eresun
40. kʿaṙasun
50. yisun
60. vatʿsun
70. ewtʿanasun
80. utʿsun
90. innsun
The word hariwr 'one hundred' is the basis for the ensuing multiples of 100; 200, 300, ..., 900 are composites built from hariwr. When declined, these numbers have G D Ab Sg. -oy, Pl. -ocʿ and I Sg. -ov, Pl. -ovkʿ. The word hazar 'one thousand' follows the a-declension of invariable stem nouns, e.g. am, with G Sg. hazari and Pl. hazaracʿ. bewr 'ten thousand', also written biwr, follows the u-declension of invariable stem nouns, cf. cov. Thus it has G Sg. biwroy, Pl. biwrocʿ. The hundreds and above are listed below,

100. hariwr
200. erkeriwr
300. erekʿhariwr
400. čʿorekʿhariwr
500. hinghariwr
600. vecʿhariwr
700. ewtʿnhariwr
800. utʿhariwr
900. innhariwr
1,000. hazar, G Sg. hazari, Pl. hazaracʿ
2,000. erku hazar
...
10,000. bewr or biwr, G Sg. biwroy, Pl. biwrocʿ
When compound numbers are formed, the larger numbers are placed first and the last number joined after the conjunction ew, much as in English. For example,

99. innsun ew inn;
1,335. hazar erekʿ hariwr eresun ew hing;
41,500. kʿaṙasun ew mi hazar ew hing hariwr.
When the cardinal number is inflected, the substantive which it modifies is inflected: z-eris awurs 'for three days'; i čʿorcʿ hołmocʿ 'from the four winds'. When the cardinal number is uninflected, the substantive is often in the singular after the number: i veray tasn kʿałakʿi 'over ten cities'; but ewtʿn kreštakag'n 'to the seven angels'. When the cardinal number follows the substantive, the substantive is declined, the numeral may be or may not: aṙakʿelocʿn erkotasancʿ 'of the twelve apostles' (both declined); lucʿs hing 'five yokes' (only substantive declined); ogis ewtʿanasun ew hing 'seventy-five souls' (only substantive declined).

Note several numerals may slightly change form when in compounds. For example, erku 'two' gives erkotasan 'twelve' and erkeam (< erki + am) 'two-year period', erksayri 'double-edged'; erekʿ 'three' gives eṙapatik 'triple'; čʿorkʿ 'four' gives čʿorekʿtasan 'fourteen', čʿorekʿhariwr 'four hundred', čʿorekʿkin 'quadruple'. Note also the element kʿaṙ 'four' used in compounds, e.g. kʿaṙasun 'forty', kʿaraniwtʿ 'composed of the four elements'.

17.2 Ordinal Numbers
The ordinal aṙaǰim 'first' is declined in the same manner as im 'my, mine':

 	 	aṙaǰim
 	 	'first'
N Sg.	 	aṙaǰim
Ac	 	aṙaǰim
G	 	aṙaǰnoy
D	 	aṙaǰnoy
L	 	aṙaǰnum
Ab	 	aṙaǰnmē
I	 	aṙaǰnov
The remaining ordinals are formed by means of the suffix -rord, for 2 through 4, or -erord, from 5 onward. This inflects as am, according to the a-declension of invariable stems. The first few ordinals are as follows.

2nd erkrord
3rd errord
4th čʿorrord
5th hingerord, without reduction of -i-
6th vecʿerord
...
The form aṙaǰnord occurs as a substantive meaning 'leader'.

In forming ordinals from numbers containing ew, typically only the last numeral takes the ordinal suffix. This however is not a hard and fast rule, different authors even using different conventions for the same number:

24th kʿsan ew čʿorrord;
66th vatʿsunerord vecʿerord.
Ordinals, when modifying nouns, obey the usual rules for adjectives discussed in the first lesson. Note however that at times a cardinal number is found where an ordinal might be expected.

17.3 Collective, Multiplicative, Iterative, Distributive, and Fractional Forms
Classical Armenian makes use of several suffixes to further shade the meaning of numerals.

Collective

The suffixes -kʿean and -kʿin denote a collective use of numerals:

erkokʿean 'both';
erekʿean 'all three';
čʿorekʿean 'all four';
hingekʿean 'all five', without reduction of -i-;
... .
Sample declensions are as follows.

 	 	erkokʿean	 	erekʿean	 	erkokʿin
 	 	'both'	 	'all three'	 	'both'
N	 	erkokʿean	 	erekʿean	 	erkokʿin
Ac	 	erkokʿean	 	erekʿean	 	erkosin
G	 	erkocʿuncʿ, erkocʿun	 	erecʿuncʿ	 	erkocʿuncʿ
D	 	erkocʿuncʿ, erkocʿun	 	erecʿuncʿ	 	erkocʿuncʿ
L	 	erkokʿean	 	erekʿean	 	erkosin
Ab	 	erkocʿuncʿ, erkocʿun	 	erecʿuncʿ	 	erkocʿuncʿ
I	 	erkokʿumbkʿ	 	erekʿumbkʿ	 	erkokʿumbkʿ
Abstract Collectives

The suffix -eak, with genitive -eakacʿ, is used to form abstract collectives, e.g. erreak 'trinity', tasneak 'decade', hariwreak 'the (entire) hundred'.

Multiplicative

The suffixes -kin, -krkin, and -patik are used to form multiples of numerals: erekʿkin 'threefold', hingkrkin 'five-fold', hariwrapatik 'hundred-fold'. Note erekʿkin has G Sg. erekʿni or erekʿnoy, Pl. ereknacʿ. Such multiplicative forms may be found in verbs: erekʿknem 'I repeat three times'.

Iteratives

The suffixes -icʿs and -(e)kin may be used as iteratives: erkicʿs 'twice', ewtʿanasnekin 'seventy times'.

Distributive

Distributive meaning is often conveyed through doubling of the numeral: mi mi 'one each'. The same effect, however, may also be gained by use of the collective forms: erkokʿean 'two each'.

Fractional

Fractions are for the most part denoted by the ordinal, e.g. errord '(a) third'.

17.4 Numeral Interrogative and Iterative Adverb
The question of quantity is specified through the use of the word kʿan⁰i 'how much?, how many?': kʿan⁰i nkanak unikʿ 'how many loaves have you?' The same word, kʿani, may be used in an exclamatory role: kʿani varjkankʿ icʿen i tan hawr imoy hacʿalicʿkʿ 'how many hired servants there are in my father's house sated with bread!'

There is a similar distinction made with the iterative adverb kʿanicʿs. In an interrogative role it has the sense of 'how often?, how many times?': kʿan⁰icʿs angam etʿe mełicʿē inj ełbayr im, ew tʿołicʿ nma 'how many times, if my brother sins against me, shall I forgive him?' When not used interrogatively, it may have the sense 'as often as': kʿanicʿs angam etʿe uticʿēkʿ zhacʿs zays ew zbažaks əmpicʿēkʿ 'as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup'.

18 Participle, Infinitive, and Verbal Adjectives
18.1 Participle Formation
Classical Armenian has one true participle. This is a past participle formed from the aorist stem by addition of the ending -eal. This is then declined according to the o-declension, e.g. N Ac Sg. asacʿeal, G D Ab Sg. asacʿeloy (from *-eal-oy), etc. For verbs whose presents are formed with simple -em or -im, the stem may lack the -ecʿ suffix of the aorist. When simple present stems are paired with root aorists, the participle is formed from the simple verbal root as expected. Examples are given below.

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Participle
 	 	grem 'I write'	 	grecʿi	 	greal
 	 	bazmim 'I sit'	 	bazmecʿay	 	bazmeal
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	hayim 'I look'	 	hayecʿay	 	hayecʿeal
 	 	kočʿem 'I call'	 	kočʿecʿi	 	kočʿecʿeal, kočʿeal
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	hanem 'I draw'	 	hani	 	haneal
 	 	nstim 'I sit down'	 	nstay	 	nsteal
 	 	tʿołum 'I let'	 	tʿołi	 	tʿołeal
Root aorists in -eay, built from original i-stems as in pʿaxeay 'I fled' < *pʿaxi-ay and sarteay 'I startled' < *sarti-ay, do not form participles from this stem. The participle is instead formed from the corresponding causative base: pʿax-ucʿ-eal 'having fled', from pʿaxucʿanem 'I put to flight, chase', supplies the participle for pʿaxčʿim 'I flee'. Aorist stems in -u- are not defective in this manner, simply adding -eal to the stem: tu-eal 'given' from etu, aorist of tam 'I give'; erdu-eal 'having sworn' from erduay, aorist of erdnum 'I swear'.

18.2 Participle Usage
The Classical Armenian participle is a past participle and makes no distinction between active or passive voice. For example asacʿeal 'having spoken' or 'having been said'; meṙeal 'dead'; bereal 'having carried' or 'having been carried'. The participle may be inflected to function as an attributive or predicate adjective, e.g. ztueal hramans katarēr 'he fulfilled the commands that had been given'. It may also be used as a substantive: asacʿealkʿ margarēin 'the sayings of the prophet, the prophet's words'; ənkalay zgreals kʿo 'I received your letter'.

The participle may also be used in periphrastic verbal constructions to denote completed actions. The tense of such constructions follows that of the auxiliary verb, present tense of the auxiliary yielding a perfect construction, imperfect auxiliary yielding a pluperfect. A future perfect is found with the subjunctive of em 'I am'. Some statements may omit the auxiliary altogether. In these constructions, the form of the participle remains unaltered, even in the plural. Examples are hramayeal ē yAstuacoy zi... 'it is commanded by God that...'; tʿo'\eal licʿin mełkʿ kʿo 'may your sins be forgiven'; žamanak im čʿew ē haseal 'my time has not yet come'; ... ur dpirkʿn ew cerkʿ žołoveal ein '... where the scribes and elders had gathered'.

There is a noteworthy construction involving what is termed the genitive subject. The participle may be used in an impersonal construction, whereby the -eal from remains in the singular with a singular copula, and takes an accusative object. The subject, however, is placed in the genitive. For example, ekełecʿin zor šineal ēr mecin Grigori 'the church which Gregory the great had built'; ew zays o⁰čʿ ē əntʿercʿeal jer 'and have you not read this?'; arkeal ēr nocʿa uṙkans i cov 'they had thrown (their) nets into the lake'. Such expression seems to have arisen as a sort of possessive construct, with a phrase like nora (Gen.) ē gorceal 'his is (the thing) done' > 'he has done' in parallel to nora (Gen.) ē handerj 'his is clothing' > 'he has clothing'.

The -eal participle may be used in conjunction with another finite verb where English might have two separate finite verbs, e.g. matucʿeal borot mi erkir paganēr mna 'a leper approached and worshipped him'. The genitive subject is sometimes found in these constructions, even though it expresses the subject of both the participle and finite verb: tʿołeal Yisusi zžołovurdsn ekn i tun 'Jesus left the crowds and went to the house'; ew nocʿa aṙeal zarcatʿn ararin orpēs usann 'and they took the money and did as they had been told'. The -eal participle may also be used alone as a main verb in historical narrative: zaysu žamanakaw miabaneal Alankʿ... mecaw amboxiw taraceal ənd ašxarhs mer 'about this time the Alans united... and in a great host spread over our land'.

18.3 Infinitive
There is only one infinitive in Classical Armenian, formed from the present stem by addition of the suffix -l. The infinitive functions as a substantive and declines according to the o-declension. It does not distinguish active and passive. The -l ending is preceded by the characteristic vowel of a verb's conjugation, except that both e- and i-conjugation verbs form the infinitive with e. For example:

Class	 	Present	 	Infinitive
e	 	sirem	 	sirel, G sireloy
i	 	sirim	 	sirel, G sireloy
a	 	lam	 	lal, G laloy
u	 	hełum	 	hełul, G hełloy < *hełu-loy
o	 	(gom)	 	(gol, G goloy)
In post-classical times a mediopassive form in -il developed to distinguish verbs of the i-conjugation.

The infinitive is regularly used as a complement after certain verbs, such as kamim 'I wish to', unim 'I have to', tam 'I have (someone) do (something)', sksim 'I begin to', erknčʿim 'I am afraid to', tʿołum 'I allow to'. Certain expressions are also common with the infinitive, e.g. law ē 'it is good to', aržan ē 'it is right to'. The infinitive may be used with verbs of motion to indicate purpose: gayr yaytnel zawetisn 'he came (in order) to reveal the news'. Result may be indicated by use of minčʿew with the infinitive: minčʿew zarmanal amenecʿun 'so that everyone was amazed'. Used as a substantive, the infinitive may be found in any case: mis utel (N) očʿ en mełkʿ 'eating meat is not a sin'; yaṙaǰ kʿan zlineln (A) ašxarhi 'before the world came into being'; vasn imoy tanǰeloy (G) i kʿēn 'because I am being tortured by you'; akn unein ǰrocʿn yuzeloy (D) 'they were waiting for the movement of the waters'; i baṙnal (L) tērutʿeann jArtawanay, i spananel (L) zna Artašri 'when rule was taken from Artavan and when Artashir killed him'; gtakʿ zsa zi argeloyr i taloy (Ab) harks kayser 'we found him preventing the giving of tribute to Caesar'; zayd bans aselov (I) ew zmez tʿšnamanes 'by saying these words you also insult us'.

The instrumental case of the infinitive is widely used, sometimes occuring where a participle might otherwise occur: awrinadrē tʿagaworn zinkʿn ew ztun iwr, skizbn aṙnelov (I) i glxoyn iwrmē ew i tʿagē 'the king set in order his own person and his house, beginning with himself and the crown'. The infinitive may be used in the instrumenal in an absolute sense; the logical subject in these contructions is expressed by a genitive: ekn Nersēs i meǰ nocʿa ew arar xałałutʿiwn, lselov nma tʿagaworin ew naxararacʿn 'Nerses came into their midst and made peace, the king and nobles obeying him'.

18.4 Verbal Adjectives
There are two verbal adjectives often termed 'participles' by grammarians. These are derived by means of the suffixes -locʿ and -li. These are added to the same present stem from which the infinitive is derived, that is, to the present tense stem without the personal endings. Neither form makes a distinction between active and passive. The verbal adjective in -locʿ is generally used as a predicate and does not occur in oblique cases. Often termed the future participle or participium necessitatis, the -locʿ form often connotes futurity or necessity: sirelocʿ e 'he should love, he should be loved'; or galocʿn e 'that which is to come, that which shall come'. The verbal adjective in -li, termed the participle of possibility, is used as a true adjective and may be found in any case. Its declension follows that of tełi. Examples are sireli 'lovable, beloved', zarmanali 'admirable' from zarmanam 'I marvel', əntʿeṙnli 'readable' < *-nu-li from əntʿeṙnum 'I read'.

Consult also the section on Word Formation in Lesson 5 for other nominalized verbal derivatives.

19 Comparison
There is one intensive suffix, -a-goyn, which may be added to adjectives to produce forms with comparative or superlative sense: imastnagoyn 'very wise' from imastun 'wise'; vołagoyn 'sooner, very soon' from voł 'soon'; baregoyn (< *bari-a-goyn) 'very good' from beri 'good'. Otherwise, there are no separate suffixes which serve to derive comparative or superlative forms from adjectives. There are, however, some common collocations used to indicate direct or indirect comparison.

19.1 Comparative
The comparative degree may be indicated by constructions involving the adverbs aweli 'more', aṙawel 'more', ews 'yet, still, even'. For example, ew ews čʿar pataṙumn lini 'and the split became even worse'; or sirē zhayr kam zmayr aṙawel kʿan zis 'whoever loves his father or mother more than me'. The last example illustrates the use of kʿan in the role 'than'. If the object of comparison is expressed through a noun, pronoun, or adjective, z- is prefixed to this elements as in the preceding example. The adverbs aweli or aṙawel need not be present for kʿan to fulfill this comparative role: cʿankali ē na kʿan zoski 'it is more desirable than gold'. Note that the adjective need not take any special form: pʿokʿr ē zamenayn sermanis 'it is smaller than all seeds'. kʿan may stand alone, without the prefix z-, as in the following: law ē koyr ačʿawkʿ kʿan koyr mtawkʿ 'it is better to be blind with the eyes than blind with the mind'. kʿan may mark the comparative of adverbs as well as adjectives: kʿan amenays urekʿ aṙawel yEpʿesos paštein zArtemis 'they (i.e. people) worshipped Artemis more in Ephesus than anywhere else'.

19.2 Superlative
The superlative degree is often denoted through constructions involving amenayn 'all, every' or amenekʿean 'all individuals' (cf. the section on Collective Pronouns above). An example was given in the preceding paragraph which straddles the comparative and superlative: pʿokʿr ē zamenayn sermanis 'it is smaller than all seeds', giving the sense 'it is the smallest of all seeds'. Another example is or pʿokʿrikn ē jamenesean i jez 'whoever is the smallest among you all'. The notion of 'all', however, need not be expressed explicitly: gełecʿikd i kanays 'O you most beautiful among women!'

There are also special adjectival formations which elicit the sense of the superlative. The form amen-a- may be prefixed to an adjective: amenabari 'very good'; amenasurb 'most holy'. Reduplication, or iteration, is another common means of intensifying the force of an adjective. A linking vowel -a- often intercedes: barjrabarj or barjraberj 'very high' from barjr 'high'; mec mec or mecamec 'greatest' from mec 'big'. Some such collocations may be used as substantives: mecameckʿ 'magnates, most important nobles'. Iteration may also intenstify adverbs: arag arag 'very fast'. See also the section on Word Formation in Lesson 5 for further details on iteration.

19.3 Comparative Clauses
Comparison may also be made though employment of constuctions spanning entire clauses. Some of the more common among such constructions are listed below for reference.

Correlative Comparison: The separate clauses are generally correlated by orpēs (zi)... aynpēs 'just as... , so...', though the latter conjunction is often omitted. Examples are: orpēs pʿapʿagi ełǰeru yałbers ǰurcʿ, aynpēs pʿapʿagi anjn im aṙ kʿez 'just as the deer yearns for the waters' springs, so my soul yearns for you'; orpēs zi očʿ əntrecʿin zAstuac unel i gitutʿean, natneacʿ znosa Astuac i mits anargutʿean 'as I did not care to hold God in esteem, so he betrayed them to a careless mind'; arar tər, orpēs asacʿn Movsēe 'the master did as Moses had said'.

Increasing Comparison: This heading here denotes statements of the form 'better that A should B, than that C should D', where the A-B clause as a whole is compared to the C-D clause. In such statements, kʿan tʿe fills the role of the English 'than that...'. Examples are law ēr nma, tʿe vēm erkanakʿar kaxēr zparanocʿē nora..., kʿan tʿe gaytʿagłecʿucʿanē zmi okʿ... 'it would be better if a millstone were placed round his neck than that he should offend someone'; mez law licʿi meṙanel kʿan tʿe əst awrēns ancʿanicʿem 'it would be better for us to die than that we transgress the laws.' When the 'that that...' clause is placed first, kʿan may be found without tʿe. In this situation, kʿan has the sense of 'rather than that...': kʿan znosa arkanēr i gehen, zna... əndē⁰r očʿ arkanēr... 'rather than that he throw them into Hell... why did he not throw...?'

Correlative Increasing Comparison: Under this heading fall constructions like the English 'the more... the merrier'. Such constructions in Classical Armenian are signalled by orčʿapʿ... aynčʿapʿ or orčʿapʿ... ews. For example, orčʿapʿ na patuirēr nocʿa, nokʿa ews aṙawel kʿarozein 'the more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed.'

Unreal Comparison: These are introduced by the conjunctions orpēs zi, ibrew zi tʿe, orpēs tʿe, ibrew tʿe 'as if'; ibr očʿ etʿe, ibrew očʿ etʿe 'not as if'. The verbal mood in such clauses is variable, though the subjunctive is typical following orpēs zi, orpēs tʿe, ibrew zi and the indicative is typical following the negative ibr očʿ etʿe. The indicative is also found in clauses which are not negated, e.g. orpēs tʿe ēg okʿ inčʿ ēr hiwłn 'as if the matter were something female.' Other examples are orpēs zi ayr mi arkanicʿē sermanis jerkir 'as if a man casts seed upon the earth'; ararin iwreancʿ jeṙagorc ibrew zi tʿe anerewoytʿn Astuac stutʿeanb inčʿ pašticʿi 'they did their work as if the invisible God would be honored by falsehoods'; ibr očʿ etʿe anawrēn inčʿ ei Astucoy, ayl... 'not as if I was lawless before God, rather...'.

20 Time and Temporal Clauses
20.1 Time
Common words related to the expression of time are listed below:

žam, G žamu 'hour'
awr, G awur 'day'
amis, G amsoy, L amsean 'month'
am, G amacʿ 'year'
amaṙn, G amaraynoy 'summer'
jmeṙn, G jmeraynoy 'winter'
garun, G garnaynoy 'spring'
ašun, G ašnaynoy 'autumn'
Temporal expressions may be broken down into statements about the time at which (point) an event occurs, the time from which (origin), the time during which (expanse), and the time up to which (terminus). Each such expression is typically handled through a preposition with a corresponding nominal case. The most common are listed below.

at which -- i + Locative, e.g. i hingerord žanu 'at the fifth hour'; i tasnerordum awur amsoyn 'on the tenth day of the month'. The date is expressed by a cardinal number when awr is omitted: i kʿsan ew čʿors amsoyn 'on the twenty-fourth of the month'. Seasons are often found without the preposition i, thus amarayni or yamarayni 'in summer'.
from which -- i + Ablative, e.g. skseal i čʿorrord amēn minčʿew i metasan amn iwroy tērutʿeann 'beginning from the fourth year up to the eleventh year of his reign'.
during which -- Accusative, with or without z-; aṙ or z- + Instrumental; əst + Ablative. Examples of the accusative construction are zawurs eris 'for three days'; žam mi 'for one hour'. Examples of the instrumental construction are aṙ hnawkʿn tʿgaworawkʿn 'in the time of the ancient kings'; zaysu žamanakaw 'about this time'. An example of the ablative construction is awr əst awrē 'day by day'.
up to which -- minčʿew + cʿ/i + Accusative, e.g. et nocʿa datawors minčʿew i Samuēl margarē 'he gave them judges up to the prophet Samuel'; mincʿew cʿaysawr 'up to today'.
20.2 Temporal Clauses
Contemporaneous Action: Clauses denoting action simultaneous with the main clause are set off by the conjunction minčʿ. This may be reinforced by deṙ, written minčʿ deṙ or minčʿdeṙ, or by ew, written as minčʿew. Thus one finds minčʿder ancʿanēr, etes ayr mi 'while he was passing he saw a man'. The particle deṙ may stand alone: ibrew bazmecʿan ew deṙ utein 'when they had sat down and while they were still eating'.

The particles minčʿ and minčʿew may be used to express 'until': minčʿew gam es, mit dir əntʿercʿuacocʿ 'until I come, attend to the readings'. For the use of minčʿew to express result, see the section above on the infinitive.

Constructions with kʿan are often used, such as cʿ-or-kʿan 'as long as'. For example, cʿorkʿan unicʿin zpʿesayn 'as long as they have the groom'.

Antecedent Action: Expression of actions preceding that of the main clause may employ minčʿ čʿew, also written together as minčʿčʿew. Examples are minčʿ čʿew bnaw ēr inčʿ 'before anything at all existed'; minčʿčʿew hawu xawseal icʿē, ericʿs urascʿes zis 'before the cock crows you will deny me thrice'.

The conjunction yaṙaǰ kʿan may express 'before'. The infinitive is often employed instead of a finite verb. For example, yaṙaǰ kʿan zlineln Abrahamu em es 'before Abraham came into being, I am'.

The conjunction ibrew may be used with the aorist indicative to express 'when' or 'after': ibrew tesin zna, erkir pagin nma 'when they saw him, they worshipped him'.

Future Action: The conjunctions ibrew and y-or-žam express 'when' or 'as' in a future sense: ibrew mtanicʿēkʿ i kʿałakʿn, patahescʿē jez ayr mi 'when you enter the city, a man will meet you'; minčʿew cʿawrn cʿayn joržam arbicʿ zna nor 'until that day when I shall drink it afresh'.

Lesson 5
Todd B. Krause, John A.C. Greppin, and Jonathan Slocum
Arshak II and the Partitioning of Armenia
Under Constantine, rumblings of division within the Roman empire shifted attention away from the eastern provinces. This left Armenia with little hope of assistance against the onslaughts of the new Sasanid king, Shapur II (309 - 379 A.D.). It was amidst his attacks on Armenia and Syria, and in response to the Zoroastrian proselytizing, that Trdat the Great had chosen to make Armenia a Christian state.

Just who ruled Armenia after Trdat the Great remains veiled in obscurity. The next ruler to emerge, about whom some certain information is known, was Arshak II. It is not clear, however, if his reign began in 338 or 350 A.D. Under his rule, Armenia entered a period of restructuring, which began with the Church. A descendant of Gregory, Nerses I, became the catholicos and forbade the practice of any non-Christian religions. Permitting married men to join the clergy, he established church hierarchy wherein non-celibate clergy were subordinate to the celibate clerics. Arshak, however, was a proponent of the Arian doctrine, and when Nerses would not fall in line with this view, Arshak had him replaced. Such leniency was not granted to other nobles, whom Arshak had killed if they voiced any opposition.

Arshak's position of relative security faltered when Shapur II defeated the emperor Julian and forced his successor Jovian to cede Armenia to Persia in 364 A.D. Arshak and his general Vasak Mamikonian were taken to Persia and blinded, and Arshak's wife was likewise killed. Only his son Pap escaped to Pontus. Armenia was thus subject to Persian domination, and Zoroastrianism was imposed as the state religion.

Rome finally took initiative in 367 A.D., supplying troops to Arshak's son Pap and an Armenian general Mushegh Mamikonian, who managed to re-take Armenia from the Persians. Pap invited Nerses to return as catholicos; but Pap's pro-Arian views, in line with those of the emperor Valens, led to dissent within the Church. Nerses was eventually killed and Mushegh Mamikonian, together with several nobles, turned against Pap. The nobles split the region of Dsopk into five districts, independent and under the protection of Rome. Pap was murdered in 374 A.D., and the nephew who succeeded him was soon replaced by a Mamikonian. The death of Shapur in 379 A.D. and the partition of the Roman empire into the Western and Eastern empires changed the political climate, and the Mamikonians eventually restored Pap's two sons to the throne, marrying them to Mamikonian women.

Pap's younger son, Arshak III, was forced to flee to the western regions in 385 A.D., and the Arshakuni prince Khosrov IV was elevated to king by the pro-Persian nobles. In 387 A.D., the emperor Theodosius and Shapur III decided to partition Armenia, and Arshak III was given reign over the Byzantine-controlled western region. Khosrov IV continued to rule over Greater Armenia subject to Sasanid domination. When Arshak died, no new Armenian king was appointed, and the Arshakuni line came to an end in Byzantine Armenia. In the east, Khosrov was followed by Vramshapuh (389 - 417 A.D.). Under Vramshapuh, Sahak was named catholicos, the last one of the line of Gregory the Illuminator.

The Armenian Alphabet
The partition of Armenia into west and east divisions subject to the dominion of different empires was a force threatening to dissolve the sense of a national Armenian identity. A similar problem plagued the Armenian Church: in much of Armenia the Syrian liturgy was used and threatened the authority of the Armenian Church; Byzantium was rapidly becoming the dominant regional power in church matters; paganism and Zoroastrianism still had a foothold in Armenian territory. This was the situation which faced Vramshapuh and the catholicos Sahak. Their solution was to codify the identity of the Armenian people through their language. For this an alphabet was needed, one distinct from those of the neighboring regions. This was the task which they charged to Mesrop Mashtots, a cleric born in the province of Taron, and who had studied Greek and Syriac.

Sometime between 400 and 407 A.D., having studied other alphabets and having consulted different calligraphers, Mesrop created the Armenian alphabet. The Sasanid rulers of the time were tolerant, and Mesrop's students were able to open schools for teaching the alphabet. The Byzantine emperor Theodosius II allowed them to do the same in Byzantine Armenia. The Armenians then entered into a period of translating works from other languages, beginning with the Bible and other liturgical material. Translations of classical works of philosophy, rhetoric, and grammar soon followed, with manuscripts of Aristotle's works becoming particularly prevalent. Voluminous translation continued from the fifth to seventh centuries, when Arab invasion curbed their efforts. Original works began to be composed after the end of the Arshakuni line, signalled by the death of Vramshapuh's son Artashes IV in 428 A.D.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Yeznik Kolbatsi, that is, Yeznik of Kolb, was probably born in A.D. 400, but the date of his death is not known. The purpose of his writing was to maintain orthodoxy and to repel heresies and other religious systems that opposed Christianity. His work Against the Sects is in four books: (1) Against the Heresy of Sects; (2) Against the Religion of the Persians; (3) Against the Religion of the Greek Philosopher; (4) Against the Marcion Heresy. This passage is from Book 1, Chapter 12.

Translation
But accordingly they also ask this: "If nothing evil existed before, whence did the serpent, which you call Satan, learn the characteristics of Evil?" We say that Satan understood as evil man's disobedience to God, on account of which he induced man to this. It is like when one would be another's enemy, and having concealed his enmity, he would secretly wish to harm him; yet he would not know the nature of the harm, and having come he would wander around in search of means; then, having found the time when someone among the physicians would give an order to his adversary not to touch this thing, and not to taste such a type of food, by which he could arrive to health; and having heard of it, soon pretending under the guise of friendship, he would blame the healer; and, labelling the useful things as harmful to him, he would persuade him, and he would give directions contrary to the orders of the physician, and by this do him harm; and, if he did not recognize beforehand the nature of the harm, rather having found the cure in the physician's order, it was harmful. Thus it is thought also of Satan, his envying of the first-created man, and his not knowing the nature of the evil-doing; because, though there was no evil before, from which it was possible to recognize its nature, nevertheless having learned from God's commandment -- which was given to man to keep him from partaking of some deadly part of the plant -- he offered to man that which, though it was not a useless bit of food for man, and not by nature a deadly plant, nevertheless on this very count man was prohibited from partaking of this -- rather disobedience was the basis of death for man, as for a criminal who would disobey the dictum of an authority that would restrain him.
Grammar
21 Interrogatives and Relatives
21.1 Interrogative Adjectives, Prounouns, and Adverbs
The interrogative adjective o⁰r 'which?' is declined as follows.

 	 	Sing.	 	Pl.
N	 	o⁰r	 	o⁰rkʿ, o⁰r
Ac	 	o⁰r	 	o⁰rs, o⁰r
G	 	oro⁰y	 	oro⁰cʿ
D	 	oru⁰m	 	oro⁰cʿ
L	 	oru⁰m	 	o⁰rs, oru⁰m
Ab	 	ormē⁰	 	oro⁰cʿ
I	 	oro⁰v	 	oro⁰vkʿ
The form o⁰r of the singular is often used in place of the N Ac plural forms o⁰rkʿ and o⁰rs. Less frequently, the L singular oru⁰m replaces the L plural o⁰rs. The interrogative adjective does not distinguish between animate or inanimate referents. For example, o⁰r tʿagawor taycʿē paterazm 'which king will wage war?'; oro⁰v zawrutʿeamb kam oro⁰v anuamb ararēkʿ dukʿ zays 'by what power or by what name did you do this?'; yoru⁰m žamanaki 'at what time?'

Other interrogative adjectives are o⁰rpisi, G o⁰rpiseacʿ 'what sort of?' and kʿani⁰ 'how many?'

The interrogative pronoun is formed from two stems, o- for persons and i- for things. The i-forms exhibit no plural. The declensions are as follows.

 	 	Persons	 	Things
 	 	o-	 	i-
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	o⁰v, o⁰	 	zi⁰, zi⁰nčʿ
Ac	 	o⁰v, o⁰	 	zi⁰, zi⁰nčʿ
G	 	o⁰yr	 	ē⁰r
D	 	u⁰m	 	i⁰m, hi⁰m
L	 	u⁰m	 	i⁰m, hi⁰m
Ab	 	u⁰mē, u⁰mmē	 	i⁰mē
I	 	oro⁰v	 	i⁰w
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	o⁰ykʿ	 	-
Ac	 	o⁰ys	 	-
G	 	o⁰ycʿ	 	-
D	 	o⁰ycʿ	 	-
L	 	o⁰ys	 	-
Ab	 	o⁰ycʿ	 	-
I	 	oro⁰vkʿ	 	-
The instrumental forms oro⁰v and oro⁰vkʿ are borrowed from the interrogative adjective. The forms zi⁰ and zi⁰nčʿ display the accusative marker z-, which has spread analogically to the nominative. zinčʿ may also be used as an interrogative adjective for things, e.g. zi⁰nčʿ gorc gorceal ē kʿo 'what deed have you done?'

The forms zi⁰ and hi⁰m may mean 'why?', as well as the form zmē built from the ablative with z-. ənd and vasn may be used with the genitive in the same role: əndē⁰r, vasn ē⁰r 'why?'

There are several interrogative adverbs, referring to

place: yo⁰ 'whither?', u⁰r 'where?', usti⁰ 'whence?';
time: e⁰rb 'when?', which may be used as either interrogative or relative adverb, e.g. e⁰rb linicʿi ayd 'when will that happen?', minčʿew cʿe⁰rb icʿem ənd jez 'how long shall I be with you?', e⁰rb gnacʿin 'when they had gone...';
manner: o⁰rpēs and zia⁰rd 'how?'
21.2 Relative Pronoun
The relative pronoun has no distinct forms; rather the forms of the interrogatives are used in this role. Understanding of their usage, however, requires distinguishing between two types of relative clause: the attributive relative clause and the substantive relative clause. An attributive relative clause is one which serves to describe its antecedent noun, much as an attributive adjective does. Some English examples would be 'the person who is writing the Armenian lessons has brown hair', or 'send all email enquiries to the person by whom the Armenian lessons were written.' In both examples the relative clauses serve an adjectival, or attributive, role modifying 'the person'. By contrast a substantive relative clause is a relative clause which, as a whole, fills the place of a noun. Again, this parallels the substantive use of an adjective. Some English examples would be 'who stole the last cookie is no friend of mine', which in slightly smoother English becomes 'whoever stole the last cookie is no friend of mine'; or 'do what I say.' In the first example, the relative clause in its entirety functions as the subject of the verb 'is'; in the second example, the whole relative clause is the object of the verb 'do'. In either situation the relative clause could be replaced by a single noun, e.g. 'Cicero is no friend of mine' or 'do something.'

Once the distinction is made between types of relative clause, relative pronoun usage becomes straightforward. Namely, in

attributive relative clauses one uses or as relative.
substantive relative clauses one uses or, less often ov, o, for persons, or zinčʿ for things.
The forms are the same as those listed for the interrogative adjective and pronoun, without the question mark ⁰.

Examples of attributive relative clauses are vasn banicʿn zor pʿawsecʿan hoviwkʿn 'on account of the words which the shepherds had said'; ewtʿn łambarkʿ... or en ewtʿn hogikʿn Astucoy 'seven torches... which are the seven spirits of God'; əntreacʿ erkotasans, zors ew aṙakʿeals anuaneacʿ 'he chose twelve, whom he also called Apostles'; vecʿ awr ē, yors aržan ē gorcel 'there are six days in which working is permitted'. Note in this last example that yors < i + ors is locative.

Examples of substantive relative clauses are or hawatay yordi, ənduni zkeansn yawitenakans 'who(ever) believes in the Son obtains eternal life'; or zinčʿ asicʿē jez, arasǰikʿ 'do what he tells you'.

21.3 Indefinite Pronoun
As with the interrogative pronouns, the indefinite pronouns exibit a base o- for persons and a base i- for things. Two series of pronouns are formed from these, one with an indefinitizing suffix -mn, the other with -kʿ. Both series may be used in either adjectival or pronominal roles. The declensions are as follows.

 	 	omn	 	imn	 	okʿ	 	*ikʿ
 	 	'someone'	 	'something'	 	'someone'	 	'something'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	omn	 	imn	 	okʿ	 	*ikʿ, inčʿ
Ac	 	omn	 	imn	 	okʿ	 	-, inčʿ
G	 	urumn	 	-	 	urukʿ	 	irikʿ
D	 	umemn	 	-	 	umekʿ	 	imikʿ
L	 	umemn	 	-	 	umekʿ	 	imikʿ
Ab	 	umemnē	 	imemnē	 	umekʿē	 	imekʿ(ē)
I	 	omamb	 	-	 	-	 	iwikʿ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	omankʿ	 	-	 	-	 	-
Ac	 	omans	 	-	 	-	 	-
G	 	omancʿ	 	-	 	-	 	-
D	 	omancʿ	 	-	 	-	 	-
L	 	omans	 	-	 	-	 	-
Ab	 	omancʿ	 	-	 	-	 	-
I	 	omambkʿ	 	-	 	-	 	-
The form *ikʿ is not found alone, but only in combination with the negative čʿ- in the form čʿikʿ 'there is not, there does not exist', e.g cʿikʿ jez keankʿ 'there is no life for you', čʿikʿ okʿ ayl Astuac 'there is no other God'. In place of *ikʿ the noun inčʿ, G ən′i 'thing' is used. This word is also found with a prefixed negative, očʿinčʿ, G očʿənčʿi 'nothing', e.g. yočʿəčʿēn arar znosa 'He created them from nothing.' As adjective, inčʿ remains in the singular even with plural substantive: awurs inčʿ (Ac Pl.) 'for some days'.

The instrumental singular form omamb from omn fills in for the missing instrumental singular of okʿ.

The indefinite pronouns are often used to strengthen the interrogatives, e.g. o⁰v okʿ 'who indeed?, who in the world?'; orpisi okʿ kin 'what a woman!' The okʿ and *ikʿ series of indefinites, however, are not used in general declarative statements; they only occur in negative, interrogative, conditional, and relative clauses, and with the pronoun iwrakʿančʿiwr 'each', adverb haziw 'hardly' and particle tʿerews 'perhaps'. This does not hold true for the forms inčʿ. For example, ēr omn hiwand 'someone was ill', but očʿ okʿ ē 'it is no one'.

The indefinite adverb of time has two forms parallel to the pronouns: erbemn and erbekʿ 'sometime'. The same restrictions of usage apply as to okʿ, e.g. očʿ erbrkʿ 'never'.

22 Word Formation
Word formation typically treats the formation of new lexical items from old. In rare instances, such new items may be derived from complete phrases, e.g. erkrpagu 'worshipper' from erkir paganem 'I kiss the earth, I worship'; zgetnem 'I throw down' from z-getni 'to the ground'. Alternately, two lexical items may be compounded to create a new word. When this occurs, the two words are typically connected by the vowel -a-, unless the second member begins with a vowel: čʿar-a-xaws 'slanderer' < čʿar 'malicious' + xawsim 'I speak'; leṙn-a-kołmn 'hill country' < leaṙn 'mountain' + kołmn 'side, country'; barekam 'benevolent, friend' < *bari-a-kam < bari 'good' + kamim 'I will, wish'; cov-ezr 'sea-side'; jkn-ors 'fisher' < jukn 'fish' + ors 'hunter'.

Generally speaking, new lexical items derived from old may be split into two categories: derivatives from verbs and derivatives from nouns. More precisely, words are derived from noun or verb stems. Typically the noun stem is the same as the nominative-accusative form; the verb stem is either the root aorist stem or the -cʿ aorist stem. In both noun and verb derivation, the stem vowels may be subject to vocalic alternation.

22.1 Derivatives from Verbs
The most common derivatives from verbal stems are listed below.

Causative Verbs: These are usually derived from intransitive verbs, though some transitive verbs are also subject to causative derivation, e.g. bnakem 'I dwell' yields bnakecʿu'anem 'I make to dwell, I establish'. Causatives are built from the aorist stem by addition of the suffix -oycʿ- / -ucʿ-. The form -ucʿ- occurs word-internally, -oycʿ- appearing otherwise. The -e- found in -eay aorists drops before the causative suffix is added. Examples are listed below.

 	 	Present	 	Aorist	 	Causative Base
 	 	bnakem 'I dwell'	 	bnakecʿi	 	bnakecʿoycʿ-
 	 	molorim 'I err'	 	molorecʿay	 	molorecʿoycʿ-
 	 	kam 'I stand'	 	kacʿi	 	kacʿoycʿ-
 	 	usanim 'I study'	 	usay	 	usoycʿ-
 	 	daṙnam 'I turn'	 	darjay	 	darjoycʿ-
 	 	pʿaxčʿim 'I flee'	 	pʿaxeay	 	pʿaxoycʿ-
 	 	yaṙnem 'I rise'	 	yareay	 	yaroycʿ-
The present stem of causative verbs has the extension -an-. The aorist stem is the same as the base. Thus there are the following examples.

 	 	Causative Present	 	Causative Aorist	 	Caus. Aor. 3 Sg.
 	 	molorecʿucʿanem 'I lead astray'	 	molorecʿucʿi	 	molorecʿoycʿ
 	 	kacʿucʿanem 'I set up, place'	 	kacʿucʿi	 	kacʿoycʿ
 	 	usucʿanem 'I teach'	 	usucʿi	 	usoycʿ
 	 	pʿacucʿanem 'I chase'	 	pʿaxucʿi	 	pʿaxoycʿ
The 2 Sg. Imperative of causative verbs shows -oycʿ > -o, e.g. bnakecʿo 'establish!', uso 'teach!'.

Action Nouns: These are dervied by means of several suffixes. The more frequent suffixes are listed below.

-umn (3-stem (c) decl.) E.g. katarumn 'accomplishment' from katarem 'I achieve'; korcanumn 'destruction' from korcanem 'I destroy'; šaržumn 'motion' from šaržim 'I move'.
-utʿiwn (2-stem (b) decl.) E.g. pʿorjutʿiwn 'temptation' from pʿorjem 'I tempt'; mkrtutʿiwn 'baptism' from mrktem 'I baptize'; yarutʿiwn 'resurrection' from yaṙnem 'I rise'.
-st E.g. imast (i-decl.) 'intelligence' from imanam 'I understand'; govest (i-decl.) 'praise' from govem 'I praise'. Nouns in -ist and -ust follow the declension of serund in the singular, e.g. hangist 'repose', GDL hangstean, from hangčʿim 'I rest'.
-iwn (2-stem (b) decl.) E.g. kʿrtʿmnǰiwn 'grumbling' from kʿrtʿmnǰem 'I grumble'.
-an(kʿ) (a-decl.) E.g. patuiran 'order' from patuirem 'I command'.
-uac (o-decl.) E.g. xndruac 'request' from xndrem 'I seek'; yaweluac 'abundance' from yawelum 'I increase'; herjuac 'division' from herjanem 'I cleave'.
-urd, -und (declined as serund) E.g. xorhurd 'thought' from xorhim 'I meditate'; cnund 'birth, progeny' from cnanim 'I produce; I am born'.
Agent Nouns: There are a few suffixes denoting agent nouns which are worthy of mention.

-ičʿ (a-decl.) E.g. araričʿ 'creator' from aṙnem 'I make'; tuičʿ 'giver' from tam 'I give'; pʿrkičʿ 'saviour' from pʿrkem 'I rescue'; cnucʿičʿ 'midwife' from cnucʿanem 'I make to give birth, I deliver'.
-oł, -awł (a-decl.) E.g. nmanoł 'resembling' from nmanim 'I resemble'; arbecʿoł 'drunkard' from arbenam 'I get drunk'; cnawł 'parent' from cnanim 'I give birth'. This particular form of agent noun is often referred to as a present participle, on the same level in the verbal system as forms in -eal. In this classification, there is a threefold distinction with a verb such as šinem 'build': šinoł 'building', šinawł 'builder', šineal 'built, having built'. In Modern Armenian these forms have indeed come to function as present participles. In Classical Armenian, however, forms in -oł, -awł seem to be too infrequent to fill the role of a true participle, occurring less than one-tenth as often as forms in -eal.
Adjectives: The suffix -un is commonly used to derive adjectives from verbs. It follows the o-declension. Examples are šaržun 'movable, moving' from šaržim 'I move'; zelun 'running over' from zelum 'I pour, overflow'; pʿaylun 'bright' from pʿaylem 'I shine'.

22.2 Derivatives from Nouns
The most common derivatives from nominal stems are listed below.

Denominative Verbs: Nominal stems may form the base for verbs in -em and -im, more rarely -am. Examples are vkayem 'I testify' from vkay 'witness'; bžškem 'I cure' from bžišk 'physician'; anuanem 'I name' from anun 'name' (note the stem for the oblique cases is anuan-); nawem 'I sail' from naw 'ship'; srbem 'I clean' from surb 'clean, pure'; yusam 'I hope' from yoys 'hope'.

Inchoative Verbs: The suffix -anam is typically appended to adjectives to derive inchoative verbs. These fall into category (D) in the classification of verbs. Examples are ōǰanam 'I recover' from ołǰ 'healthy'; čʿoranam 'I become dry' from čʿor 'dry'. In certain instances such verbs are derived from nouns: kʿahanayanam 'I become a priest' from kahanay 'priest'; veranam 'I am extolled', cf. i ver 'upwards'.

Nouns of State or Quality: The suffix -utʿiwn may also be used to derive nouns denoting quiality. Examples are bazmutʿiwn 'multitude' from bazum 'many'; čšmartutʿiwn 'truth' from čšmarit 'true'; kʿahanayutʿiwn 'priesthood' from kʿahanay 'priest'.

Collective Nouns: Collective nouns may be derived by means of the suffixes -ik (serund-decl.), -ti (tełi-decl.), -ean. Examples are mardik 'men, people' from mard 'man'; mankti 'children' from manuk 'child'; xozean 'pigs' from xoz 'pig'. Such nouns are declined in the singular only.

Diminutive Nouns: The suffixes -ak (a-decl.) and -ik (serund-decl.) serve to derive diminutive nouns. Examples are covak 'lake' from cov 'sea'; eramak 'small herd' from eram 'herd'; ordeak 'son' from ordi 'son'; mankik 'little child' from manuk 'child'; pʿokʿrik 'little' from pʿokʿr 'little'.

Nouns of Place or Containment: Nouns denoting placement are derived by means of the suffixes -(an)ocʿ, -astan, -aran (a-decl.). Examples are žołurdanocʿ 'place of assembly' from žołowurd 'meeting'; ganjaran 'treasure-house' from ganj 'treasure'; Hayastan 'Armenia' from Hay 'Armenian'; vardastan 'rose-garden' from vard 'rose'; dprocʿ 'school' from dpir 'teacher'; amaranocʿ 'summer quarters' from amaṙn 'summer'.

Possessives and Relationals: There are several formations which yield adjectives and nouns denoting possession or relation.

-akan (a-decl.), -ayin (o-decl.), -eay (i-decl.), -in (o-decl.) These have the connotation 'pertaining to' or 'belonging to'. Examples are yawitenakan 'eternal' from yawiteankʿ 'eternity'; korstakan 'perishable, ruinous' from korust 'perdition'; maryakan 'motherly' from mayr 'mother'; amsakan 'monthly' from amis 'month'; vačaṙakan 'trader' from vačaṙ 'trade'.
-acʿi (o-decl.) This suffix forms adjectives denoting origin or possession. They refer only to people and are often used as substantives. Examples are Kołbacʿi 'coming from Kołb' from Kołb (place name); Israyelacʿi 'Israelite' from Israyēl 'Israel'; kʿałakʿacʿi 'citizen' from kʿałakʿ 'city'; dracʿi 'neighbor' from duṙn, Pl. durkʿ 'doors'.
-awor (a-decl.) This suffix typically connotes 'possessing' or 'related to'. Derivatives stemming from this suffix are often used as substantives. Examples are tʿagawor 'king, the one wearing the crown' from tʿag 'crown'; zawrawor 'mighty' from zawr 'strength'; meławor 'sinner' from meł 'sin'; datawor 'judge' from dat 'judgement'; marmnawor 'bodily' from marmin 'body'.
-eay (i-decl.), -ełen (a-decl.) These suffixes generally have the sense 'made of' or 'consisting of'. Examples are arcatʿeay 'of silver' from arcatʿ 'silver'; tasnawreay 'consisting of ten days' from tasn 'ten' + awr 'day'; sewačʿeay 'having black eye' from seaw 'black' + akn, Pl. ačʿkʿ 'eye'; garełēn nkanak 'barley loaf'.
-ean (a-decl.) In addition to rather general relational derivatives such as arewelean 'eastern' from arewelkʿ (Pl.) 'East', this suffix is often used to form patronymics. Examples are płatonean 'platonic' from Płaton 'Plato'; Aramean 'son/progeny of Aram'; Mamkionean 'son/progeny of Mamikon'.
-eni (tełi-decl.) This is a possessive suffix often used in names of fruit-bearing trees. Examples are mayreni 'motherly' from mayr 'mother'; xozeni 'of pigs' from xoz 'pig'; jitʿeni 'olive tree' from jētʿ 'olive'; tʿzeni 'fig tree' from tʿuz 'fig'; vardeni 'rosebush' from vard 'rose'.
-i (tełi-decl.) This suffix has a general possessive or relational sense. Examples are ałi 'salty' from ał 'salt'; erkatʿi 'of iron' from erkatʿ 'iron'; arambi 'living with a man' from ayr, I Sg. aramb 'man'; bazmačʿi 'having many eyes' from bazum 'much' + akn, Pl. ačʿkʿ 'eye'; mecazgi 'noble' from mec 'big' + azg 'family'.
-ord (a-decl.) This is an unspecialized relational suffix. Examples are orsord 'hunter' from ors 'game'; aṙaǰnord 'leader' from aṙajin 'first'.
General: The following derivatives do not fit into the other categories listed above.

-agoyn (i-decl.) This is an intensifying suffix, meaning 'more' or 'very'. Examples are diwragoyn 'easier, very easy' from diwr 'easy'; kʿałcʿragoyn 'sweeter, very sweet' from kʿałcʿr 'sweet'.
-kicʿ This means 'associate, fellow, co-', as in the verb kcʿem 'I add, join'. Examples are orsakicʿ 'fellow hunter'; ułekicʿ 'fellow traveller' from ułi 'way'.
22.3 Iteration
Iteration is a process which may be used to derive new words from old. It applies equally to verbs, nouns, and adjectives. For example one finds the verbs hot-ot-im 'I smell' from hot 'scent' and kaz-kaz-em 'I run back and forth'. There are substantives xor-xor-at 'pit' from xor 'deep', leṙn-leṙn-ayn 'hill country' from leaṙn 'hill', heł-eł 'current' from hełanim 'I flow'. There are adjectives mec-a-mec 'very big', ǰerm-a-ǰerm 'very warm', arag-arag 'very quick'. In most instances the reduplication serves as intensification, as many of the above examples illustrate. The same effect may be achieved merely by doubling a word in context, without deriving a new combined word. For example one finds luṙ luṙ 'totally quiet' and canr canr 'very tough'.

In contrast to the notion of intensification, although in some sense allied to it, is the use of iteration in a distributive function. Examples are gund-a-gund 'in swarms' (also gund gund); goyn-a-goyn 'multicolored'; ami ami 'throughout the year'; awur awur 'day by day' (also awr awur).

At times the doubling occurs with m- preceding the second member, as in ałx-a-małx 'goods' from ałx 'equipment', and in sut mut 'completely wrong' from *sut sut.

23 Case Syntax
The most common uses of the nominal cases are outlined below. For the use of cases with simple or compound prepositions, see Section 5 of Lesson 1.

23.1 The Nominative Case
The nominative case is the case of the grammatical subject, e.g. koyrkʿ tesanen 'the blind regain their sight', astełkʿ ankcʿin yerknicʿ 'stars will fall from heaven'. When the verb is a copula, the nominative is also the case of the predicate: ein ardarkʿ erkokʿin 'they were both just'. The nominative, with or without ov, may be used in forms of address: patani du, ari 'get up, young man!' The nominative is also used when quoting a person's name, even if the noun representing the person so named is in another case: aṙ komsi umemn Likianēs anun kočʿecʿeloy 'with an earl, called Likianos by name'. Here komsi is in the locative case, modified by kočʿecʿeloy, but the name quoted, Likianēs, remains in the nominative form.

The nominativus pendens is a usage whereby a word, which in its own clause should grammatically be in another case, is placed at the head of the statement in the nominative, and then taken up again by a pronoun in the correct oblique case. For example, caṙay or ənd unkn očʿ lsē, ənd mkanuns tan lsel nma 'the servant, who does not listen with the ear, they make him listen with the back.' Here caṙay is in the nominative, marked in the main clause by the pronoun nma.

23.2 The Accusative Case
The accusative case is the case of the direct object, e.g. or očʿ berē ptuł 'which does not bear fruit'. Rarely a verb may take an internal object: erkean erkiwł mec 'they had a great fear', lit. 'they feared a great fear.' Some verbs take a double accusative, such as harcʿanem 'I ask': harcʿicʿ inčʿ zkʿez 'I ask you (something)'. The accusative may be predicate: Stoyikeankʿn... zamenayn inčʿ marmin karcecʿin 'the Stoics held everything (to be) body.' The accusative may denote an extent of space or time. From this use come such adverbs as aynawr '(during) this day', hence 'today'. An accusative of respect is found in the use of zayn awrinak 'by this means, thus', and in the use of anun in the accusative to mean 'by name, in respect of name': aṙ komsi umemn Likianēs anun kočʿecʿeloy 'with an earl, called Likianos by name'. The accusative form of adjectives may be used adverbially: barwokʿ margarēacʿaw 'they prophesied well'.

The accusative is often marked with the preposition z-. This is generally used with demonstrative pronouns, relatives, personal pronouns, proper names, and nouns with a demonstrative suffix. Examples are zna 'this', zor 'which', zis 'me', zhayrn 'the father', zAbraham 'Abraham'. The marker z- is not an inherent feature of the accusative case. It is often employed simply to distinguish the accusative form from the nominative or locative forms, e.g. yoržam dustr zmayr antrgicʿē, ew nu zkesur iwr, ew kin zayr, ew caṙay ztēr, ew ełbayr zełbayr 'as the daughter reviled her mother, and the daughter-in-law her mother-in-law, and the wife her husband, and the servant his master, and the brother his brother.' The particles kʿan 'than', ibrew 'like, as', and orpēs 'like, as' are often followed by z- plus the accusative of the point of comparison, e.g. očʿ Sołomovn... zgecʿaw ibrew zmi i nocʿanē 'Solomon... did not dress as one of them.'

23.3 The Genitive Case
The genitive case is the possessive case. More generally, it is a relational case, covering a wide range of nuanced meaning, usually delimiting or specifying the sphere of validity of its referent. In Classical Armenian, the genitive case is distinguished morphologically from the dative only by personal pronouns and demonstratives. The genitive may qualify a substantive, e.g. anun nora 'her name' or awur mioy čanaparh 'a day's journey'. The genitive may be used as a predicate: erku partapankʿ ein urumn pʿoxatui 'two debtors were of a certain lender', i.e. 'there were two debtors of a certain lender', 'a certain lender had two debtors.' A genitive modifying an infinitive used as a substantive may indicate the logical subject of the action: diwrin icʿē erknicʿ ew erkri ancʿanel, kʿan yawrinacʿn mioy nšanaxecʿi ankanel 'it is easier for heaven and earth to perish than for one stroke of the law to fall away.' The partitive genitive is more often expressed by the preposition i with the ablative, in the sense 'from among'.

Perhaps the most idiosyncratic use of the genitive in Classical Armenian is with the participle in -eal. When the subject of a clause is modified by the past participle, this subject may be in either the nominative or the genitive case, e.g. nora aṙeal zna taraw 'he, having seized (him), led him'; matucʿeal ašakertacʿn nora asen cʿna 'his disciples, having come, say to him...'. This usage is extended to impersonal constructions involving the participle, where the genitive denotes the logical subject: zpayn isk im ačʿawkʿ teseal ē 'I have seen the fairy with my own eyes'; aṙ ekełecʿeawn, zor šineal ēr aṙaǰnoyn mecin Grigori 'at the church which the first great Grigor had built.'

23.4 The Dative Case
The dative case is the case of the indirect object, or, more generally, the case of the party interested in, but not directly affected by, the actions of the statement. The dative is used frequently with verbs. Examples are cʿucʿēkʿ inj zdahekan 'show me the money'; kin kʿo cnčʿi kʿez ordi 'your woman bore you a son.' Several verbs take their object in the dative, such as tirem 'I rule', išxem 'I have power', aṙaǰnordem 'I lead', sastem 'I command', tʿagaworem 'I rule as king', yałtʿem 'I overwhelm'; hnazandim 'I comply', caṙayem 'I serve', ansam 'I conform'; hawatam 'I believe', ołormim 'I have compassion', spasem 'I tend', nerem 'I forgive'; karawtim and karawtanam 'I use'; cʿankanam 'I wish'; vnasem 'I harm', barkanam 'I become angry', spaṙnam 'I threaten'; tełekanam 'I learn of'. Examples are apa tʿe očʿ tirescʿen inj 'if they not have power over me'; inj spasecʿin meławorkʿ 'sinners served me'; tełekacʿaw hayreni gorcocʿn 'he learned of his father's deeds.' The dative may serve as a predicate when the verb is a copula, e.g. ełew nma čʿar ew očʿ inčʿ 'no evil befell him.'

The dative is also used with adjectives. These may denote similarity, e.g. nman 'similar, like', hasarak 'common, public', hamemat 'proportional, commensurate'; or they may denote knowledge, e.g. gitak 'knowing', tełeak 'well-informed, instructed, skilled-in', hmut 'knowledgeable, skilled, learned', xelamut 'taught, informed, learned'; or usefulness, e.g. pitani, pitoy 'helpful', anpitan 'useless', hačoy 'pleasing', vnasakar 'harmful', patrast 'prepared', partakan 'guilty'. Examples are erkrordn nman smin 'the second similar to this one'; meṙealkʿ očʿ en gitak ew očʿ imikʿ 'the dead know nothing'; čʿē aynm partakan Astuac 'God is not to blame for this.'

In clauses with the infinitive, the dative may often be considered to be related to one word in particular, usually the infinitive itself. In these situations the dative often supplies the subject of the action denoted by the infinitive, e.g. ełew šabatʿu... ančʿanel nma ənd artoraysn 'it happened on the sabbath... that he went through the fields'; part ē inj awetaranel 'it is necessary for me to preach.' Such constructions occur where Latin and Greek might employ an accusative and infinitive.

23.5 The Locative Case
The locative case denotes static position in space or time, generally equivalent to the English 'in', 'on', or 'at'. In Classical Armenian the locative is only found with prepositions. By far the most common preposition is i, e.g. yaynm kłzwoǰ očʿ gtanēr očʿ ǰur... ew očʿ... 'on this island was found neither water nor...'. It is also used with aṙ 'beside', e.g. nstēr aṙ durs 'he sat by the door'; with ənd 'with', e.g. xawsel ənd nosa 'to speak with them'; seldom with z-, e.g. zgetni harkanel 'to cast on the ground'; with əst 'after', e.g. hatucʿanes iwrakʿančʿiwr əst gorcs iwr 'you shall repay each according to his deeds.'

23.6 The Ablative Case
The ablative case denotes the source or origin, and separation therefrom. The ablative is used without a preposition only in certain fixed situations, generally in conjunction with a monosyllabic substantive in the accusative, often marked by i. Examples are z'amē i žam 'from time to time'; am yamē 'each year'; tanē i tun 'from house to house'; azgē yazg 'from people to people'; minčʿew i nawasardē nawasard 'from new year to new year', that is, 'till the new year'; i kʿałakʿē i kʿałakʿ 'from city to city'. The ablative forms of personal pronoun, such as injēn and kʿezən, may be used without propositions, typically with the meaning 'self': es injēn as′awkʿ tesi 'I have seen it with my own eyes.'

23.7 The Instrumental Case
The instrumental case denotes the means or instrument of an action, whether physical or other. It roughly takes the place of the English preposition 'with'. Examples are očʿ okʿ gay aṙ hayr, etʿe očʿ imew 'no one approaches the father, except though me'; eleal... i gerezmanē anti ahiw ew xndutʿeamb bazmaw 'having gone... from the grave with awe and great joy'; li xnkov 'filled with incense'. The instrumental may be used predicatively: orearn ayn xałałutʿeamb en ənd mez 'these men are peaceful with us'; mer keankʿs čʿen yusahatutʿeamb 'our life is not (fallen) into despair.' The instrumental is used in the sense of accompaniment, usually in conjunction with following handerj 'with, together with': and nstēr ašakertawkʿn handerj 'he sat there with his disciples'; Yisus ašakertawkʿn iwrovkʿ gnacʿ 'Jesus withdrew with his disciples.'

24 Future Expression and the Subjunctive
Classical Armenian lacks a morphologically distinct future tense. Inasmuch as the subjunctive expresses purpose, wish, demand, or prospect, its sense is linked to the expression of future events. It is therefore common to find the Greek future translated by the aorist subjunctive. Within native treatments of Armenian grammar it has thus been common to find the aorist subjunctive called the future tense. Since there is also a present subjunctive, some treatments refer to two future tenses. The subjunctive is not, however, the only means of relating future time in Classical Armenian. When particular emphasis or clarity is required, the present tense may express future action, e.g. očʿ hawatam 'I will not believe'. When there is an attendant sense of necessity, the verbal adjective in -locʿ is often employed in periphrastic constructions: du es or galocʿn es 'Art thou He who is to come?'.

25 Adverbial Clauses
The term adverbial clauses is here used as a catch-all term for several types of clauses which modify a statement as a whole. This is in contrast to, say, relative clauses, which usually modify a substantive within a given statement. Typically in such clauses the subjunctive and indicative moods of the verb stand in free contrast. That is to say, the indicative is generally used for actual action, otherwise the subjunctive. Some of the more important types of clauses are listed below with general comments on construction.

Final Clauses: The verb of final clauses is always subjunctive. The beginning of such clauses is typically signalled by zi, less often by tʿe, etʿe, or orpēs zi. Examples are ayl ays amenayn ełew, zi lcʿcʿi or asacʿawn i teaṙnē 'this all happened so that what the Lord had said be fulfilled'; ...etʿe gawravarin hačoy linicʿi '... so that he be pleasing to the one enlisting'; orpēs zi tescʿen zgorcs jer baris 'so that they may know your good deeds'. If the subject or object is the same as in the main clause, the final clause is typically expressed by an infinitive: taran zna i xačʿ hanel 'they led him out to crucify (him)'. A final clause with a subject different from that of the main clause may be expressed with a dative plus infinitive construction: xnayecʿi es i kʿez, čʿmełančel kʿez yis 'I look after you that you not sin against me.'

Consecutive Clauses: Also termed resultative clauses, these are introduced by orpēs zi, ibrew zi 'so that'; or simply zi 'that' or zi ew (when the preceding clause contains a word meaning 'so' or 'in such a way'). Less frequently etʿe or minčʿew introduce these clauses. Examples are čʿaračʿarkʿ yoyž, orpēs zi čʿer hnar ancʿanel umekʿ ənd ayn čanaparh 'exceedingly harsh, so that it was not possible for any one to proceed by that path'; aynčʿapʿ emkʿ ołormeli ibrew zi aṙancʿ jorjoy mi awr čʿkaremkʿ hamberel 'we are so dejected that we cannot go one day without a coat'; Astuac aynpēs patuel zmardn kamecʿaw, zi ganjničʿxanutʿiwnn pargeweacʿ nma 'God wanted to so honor man that He granted him free will.' An extended example of the use of etʿe is the following: kʿanzi očʿ etʿe anmit inčʿ okʿ ełew na jAstucoy, etʿe čʿgitēr, etʿe or inčʿ əst Astucoy kamacʿn lini, bari ē 'since there was none created by God so ignorant that he knew not that whatever happened by the will of God is good.'

Temporal Clauses: These have been treated separately in Lesson 4, Section 20.

Causal Clauses: These are usually introduced by zi, kʿanzi, vasn zi, tʿe or etʿe, orovhetew 'since, because'; manawand zi 'especially since'. If the causal clause treats a factual occurrence, the verb is conjugated in the indicative; if the clause treats an assumed occurrence or one which is denied or refuted, the verb may be either indicative or subjunctive. Examples are zia⁰rd linicʿi inj ayd, kʿanzi zayr očʿ gitem 'how will this be, since I do not know a man'; əndē⁰r zxawss im očʿ gitēkʿ dukʿ, vasn zi očʿ karēkʿ lsel zbann im 'on what account do you not know my speech? since you are not able to hear my word'; manawand zi gtanemkʿ 'especially since we find'. zi may be strengthened by the demonstrative ays or its instrumental form aynu, e.g. aynu zi əst čʿareacʿ gorcočʿn vrēžs pahanǰicʿē, yayt ē etʿe... 'since he imposes penalties according to the wicked deeds, so it is clear that...'.

Concessive Clauses: These are introduced by tʿēpēt, tʿepēt 'though, although', usually followed by ew; tʿe ew 'even though'; tʿepēt... tʿepēt 'be it that... be it that'; etʿe... (ew) etʿe 'either... or'. Examples are tʿēpēt ew ordi ē, usaw zhnazandutʿiwn 'though being the son, he learned obedience'; ew čʿem tʿepēt aržani 'though I am not worthy'; tʿe ew trtmecʿucʿi zjez tʿłtʿovn očʿ złǰanam 'even if I pained you in the letter, I am not sorry'; ard, əte uticʿēkʿ, etʿe əmpicʿēkʿ 'therefore, either eat or drink!'

Local Clauses: These are introduced either by relative adverbs jo 'to where, whither', ur 'where, to where', usti 'from where, whence' or by prepositional constructions involving relative adverbs. Examples are ur ganjkʿ jer en and ew sirtkʿ jer ełicʿin 'where your treasures are, there too will be your heart'; yor tun mtanicʿēkʿ, andēn awtʿewans kalǰikʿ 'in whichever house you enter, take accomodations there.'

Comparative Clauses: These have been treated in Lesson 4, Section 19.

Exceptional Clauses: Under this heading are grouped clauses often beginning in English with 'unless, except that..., save that..., save to...'. In some instances Classical Armenian uses a construction with infinitive and preposition, or with a negative participle: očʿinčʿ gorceal... matnecʿay 'but had I done something,... I was betrayed'. Elsewhere clauses with finite verb forms are employed. baycʿ etʿe often serves as English 'unless', usually followed by the subjunctive: o⁰v ē skizbn aynpisi anpatehicʿ, baycʿ etʿe icʿē inčʿ čʿar zawrutʿiwn 'who is the origin of such inconsistencies, unless it is an evil force.' pʿoxanak zi, and sometimes kʿan, renders English 'rather than that': pʿoxanak zi part er jez linel vardapets, pitoy ē jez usanel 'rather than that you should become teacher, it is proper that you learn.'

Conditional Clauses: The subordinate clause (protasis) is introduced by the conjunction etʿe, less often tʿe, and only rarely with zi. Use of zi in particular gives the sense 'when, in the case that': zi aṙancʿ kamacʿn Astucoy gorcin irkʿ inčʿ, linin čʿar 'in the case that things are done contrary to the will of God, they are bad.' The conjunction need not be the first word of the clause. očʿ is always used for negation. The main clause (apodosis) is signalled by apa, ew, or apa ew when it follows the protasis. There are three basic constructions:

Protasis: present indicative; Apodosis: indicative, subjunctive (as future), or imperative. These are the components of real conditions. Examples are etʿe očʿ lsen, ew očʿ hawatascʿen 'if they do not hear, they will not believe'; etʿe hogi bnakeal ē i jez, apa kendanacʿuscʿē 'if the spirit dwells in you, it will give life'; etʿe meṙealkʿ očʿ yaṙnen, apa ew Kʿristos čʿē yarucʿeal 'for if the dead do not rise, neither has Christ risen.'
Protasis: subjunctive; Apodosis: indicative, subjunctive (as future), or imperative. These are the components of conditions signifying assumption, possibility, uncertainty, or generalization. Examples are zays amenayn kʿez tacʿ, etʿe erkirpaganicʿes inj 'all these things I will give you, if you bow before me'; etʿe i meṙelocʿ okʿ ertʿicʿē aṙ nosa, ew apašxarescʿen 'if one of the dead journey to them, they will repent'; etʿe očʿ okʿ cncʿi verstin, očʿ karē tesanel zarkʿayutʿiwn Astucoy 'if one be not born from above, he is unable to behold the kingdom of God.'
Protasis: past indicative; Apodosis: past indicative. These describe unreal conditions. Unreal conditions concerning the present employ the imperfect indicative in both clauses: sa tʿe margarē okʿ ēr, apa gitēr... 'if this one were prophet, he would know...'; etʿe Astuac ēr hayr jer, sireikʿ ardeawkʿ zis 'if God were your father, you would love me.' Unreal conditions concerning the past typically employ a periphrastic pluperfect in either the protasis or apodosis, with a suitable past tense in the complementary clause. Examples are əte ast leal eir, ełbayrn im čʿēr meṙeal 'if you had been here, my brother would not have died'; im etʿe čʿēr ekeal, ew xawsecʿeal ənd nosa, meł inčʿ očʿ goyr nocʿa 'if I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have possessed sin.'


Selected Annotated Bibliography

Texts
For someone just beginning a study of Classical Armenian, several of the grammars have reading selections. Jensen's grammar has a separate volume dedicated to excerpts from major authors. In his work one may find references to more complete editions of the Classical Armenian authors:

Hans Jensen, Altarmenische Chrestomathie. Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitaetsverlag, 1964. Contains selections from the New Testaments, as well as the works of Moses of Khoren, Faustus of Byzantium, Koriwn, and Eznik of Kolb. Contains a glossary in German.
Grammars
There is a severe lack of grammars for Classical Armenian written in English. There are several exceptional grammars written in German:

Hans Jensen, Altarmenische Grammatik. Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitaetsverlag, 1959. A very thorough treatise on the language, giving the most complete discussion of syntax of any of the books listed. The organization, however, is idiosyncratic, making reference difficult at times.
A. Meillet, Altarmenisches Elementarbuch. Heidelberg: Carl Winters Universitaetsbuchhandlung, 1913. A classic work. Gives a brief but thorough outline of grammar, and includes several text selections together with a glossary.
Ruediger Schmitt, Grammatik des Klassisch-Armenischen. Innsbruck: Innsbrucker Beitraege zur Sprachwissenschaft, 1981. The most recent of the grammars, with the most attention to comparative issues of Classical Armenian and the other Indo-European languages. Some short reading selections with grammatical commentary.
Robert W. Thomson, An Introduction to Classical Armenian. New York: Caravan Books, 1975. Includes the text selections and glossary of Meillet's book, but structures the grammar presentation in the format of graded lessons, rather than the reference-grammar approach of the others.
Robert Godel, An Introduction to the Study of Classical Armenian. Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag, 1975. A very terse account of the language, divided into two parts: a synchronic approach, and a diachronic approach. Purely a reference grammar, with no extended textual examples.
Dictionaries
There are no dictionaries, in English, for Classical Armenian. In German, the following is noteworthy:

H. Huebschmann, Armenische Grammatik. 1 Theil: Armenische Etymologie. Leipzig: Breitkopf & Haertel, 1897. An etymological dictionary of Classical Armenian. Only the first part was published.
