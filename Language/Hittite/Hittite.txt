Series Introduction
Winfred P. Lehmann and Jonathan Slocum

Hittite is the oldest recorded Indo-European language, but it had remained completely unknown during the period in which Indo-European linguistics developed because its records are on clay tablets that were excavated only at the end of the 19th century. Even then, it was not identified as Indo-European until 1915, when Bedřich Hrozný made the discovery through his reading of tablets that had been brought to Vienna from the Istanbul Museum. Since the tablets were written in the cuneiform script, which is described in Lesson 1 Grammar point 2, they were easily read. After Hrozný documented their language as Indo-European in a book of 1917 entitled Die Sprache der Hethiter, many texts were published, some of them in cuneiform script and others in transcription. But it was not until 1951 that a comprehensive grammar was produced, A Comparative Grammar of the Hittite Language by Edgar H. Sturtevant.

As the texts were published, notable differences were recognized between Hittite and the other Indo-European languages. In the phonological system, sounds transcribed as h were found where the other languages had a long vowel, as in Hittite pahs- 'protect', Latin pāscō 'feed', and also initially where they had an a-vowel, is in Hittite hanza 'in front of', Latin ante 'before'. In 1878 Ferdinand de Saussure had proposed such consonants, and in the following year Möller labeled them laryngeals with a term taken from Hamito-Semitic linguistics of the time.

In the morphological system there are only two gender classes of nouns, common and neuter. And the verb is far simpler than that of Sanskrit or Greek, languages on which the reconstructed language, Proto-Indo-European, had been largely based. There are only two tenses: present and preterite; only two finite moods: indicative and imperative; and only two conjugations, one with first person singular ending in -mi, the other in -hi. After the implications of these for reconstructing the parent language became clear, they led to far-reaching changes in the presentation of Proto-Indo-European and the early Indo-European languages.

Among the phonological changes is the assumption of laryngeals in various positions that had been lost in the previously known Indo-European languages, but had left traces in vowels and other consonants. Under the assumption of such consonants in the so-called laryngeal theory, the roots that did not fit the typical structure of Indo-European roots, e.g. *sed- 'sit', *nem- 'take', *leg- 'pick up', previously had had comparable structure. For example, the roots *dhē- 'place', *stā- 'stand', *dō- 'give' were now posited with laryngeals rather than with long vowels: *dheh₁-, *steh₂-, *deh₃-. And the voiceless aspirated stops of Indo-Iranian, ph, th, kh were assumed to have developed from p t k plus a laryngeal. The laryngeal theory has been widely discussed, accepted in various forms, and even rejected by some scholars; but as illustrated by examples here, it is the basis for explaining many features of Proto-Indo-European and its dialects.

In the morphological system, efforts were made to account for a gender system of the two nominal classes in contrast with the three in the other languages. In the view of most scholars the twofold system was assumed to be earlier, but a minority assumed that the feminine was lost in the Anatolian languages. The greater simplicity in the verbal system, especially the position of the hi-conjugation, required especial attention. This corresponds in many ways to the perfect of Sanskrit and Greek; but with its function also in the medio-passive of Hittite it has been identified as a stative inflection. The twofold conjugations would then be based on active:stative opposition.

On the basis of its earlier attestation and differences from Proto-Indo-European as it had been reconstructed, Edgar Sturtevant and others assumed Hittite to be a sister language of Proto-Indo-European and labeled the language at that stage Indo-Hittite. The Indo-Hittite hypothesis then became dominant and has remained so for some scholars. But they failed to take into account the basis of the reconstructed Indo-European in our handbooks, such as Brugmann's Grundriss. It cannot be noted too often that Brugmann stated specifically in 1897 that his reconstructions did not represent a historically earlier language but that they were rather compilations of the data; he left the historical presentation to the future. After much discussion of the evidence for or against assumption of Indo-Hittite, it is now widely held that Hittite is not a sister language of the earlier common language from which the other dialects developed, but rather that it was recorded earlier and therefore maintained some features that were lost in the other dialects.

This position has strong support from the increased knowledge of Active/Stative languages. In such languages, nouns and verbs fall into one of two classes, either active/animate or stative/inanimate. Reconstructed Proto-Indo-European in its earlier form, of which elements are maintained in the Anatolian languages, fits the Active/Stative pattern. Both nouns and verbs belong to either of the two classes. The twofold gender distinction maintained in Hittite reflects the animate:inanimate structure in its contrast between common and neuter inflection. In the verb, the mi-conjugation reflects the earlier active inflection while the hi-conjugation reflects the stative inflection.

This understanding has affected the view of the language family in general. It is now clear that Sanskrit and Greek, with their large number of verbal inflections, developed these after the disruption of the Indo-European family. Among their new developments is the augment, which is found only in Indo-Iranian, Greek, and Armenian. Even in the Homeric language it is not yet used in all forms that require it in Classical Greek. Moreover, Germanic with its much simpler verbal inflection is closer to that of the proto-language and more similar to Hittite than are Sanskrit and Greek. We account for the similarity by assuming that Germanic, like Hittite, was one of the first to leave when the various languages split away from the parent language and that both maintained many of its features, which were later modified in Indo-Iranian, Greek, Latin, and other dialects.

The Source of the Hittites and their Dominance in Central Anatolia
It is generally assumed that the Hittites entered Anatolia some time before 2000 B.C. While their earlier location is disputed, there has been strong evidence for more than a century that the home of the Indo-Europeans in the fourth and third millennia was in what is now southern Russia and the Ukraine. The Hittites and other member of the "Anatolian" language-speaking family, then, came from the north, possibly along the Caspian Sea but perhaps more likely via the Balkans. The dominant inhabitants in central Anatolia at the time were the Hatti (from whom the word "Hittite" was later derived). There were also Assyrian colonies in the country; it was from these that the Hittites adopted cuneiform script.

It took some time for the Hittites to establish themselves, as is clear from some of the texts included here: for several centuries there were disparate Hittite and related Anatolian language groups, usually centered around various cities; but then strong rulers with their center in Hattusa (Turkish Boğazköy) succeeded in bringing these together and conquering large parts of central Anatolia to establish the Hittite kingdom. The Hittite period of dominance is divided into three periods, labeled the Old Kingdom from about 1650 B.C. to about 1500 B.C., then a Middle Kingdom about which there is relatively little information, and finally a New Kingdom continuing from ca. 1400 B.C. to the early 12th century. In this time frame, Hittite and Luvian and Palaic were the "big three" Anatolian languages, all being recorded in cuneiform inscriptions.

An early ruler in the second half of the 18th century, Anitta, left records indicating his achievements, such as capturing Hattusa (Boğazköy), but he did not create an empire or found a dynasty. The period after him was characterized by power struggles. Then the Old Kingdom was etablished by Labarna (ca. 1680-1650 B.C.). As the later Proclamation of Telepenus (ca. 1525-1500 B.C.) indicates, in the Old Kingdom beginning with the rule of Labana and his successor Hattusilis I (ca. 1650-1620) the chief aim was to gain control over the various Hittite groups and consolidate the kingdom. The grandson and successor of Hattusilis, Mursilis I (ca. 1620-1590), conducted raids as far as Babylon. Telepenus' proclamation goes on to indicate that he expected and maintained cooperation and peacefulness during his reign. But from the century after his death we have few records; hence little is known about this period, labeled the Middle Kingdom.

Then during the New Kingdom, roughly 1400-1180 B.C., the Hittites reached their greatest status under Suppiluliumas I (ca. 1380-1340). Suppiluliumas rebuilt the capital at Hattusa and reorganized the government; he also carried out campaigns against peoples in south and southwest Anatolia and established a Hittite presence in Syria that led to conflict with Egypt. During the rule of Muwatallis II (ca. 1306-1282), there was a tremendous battle between the two countries at Kadesh on the Orontes River; the result was chaos and carnage, but both sides proclaimed victory -- after hastily withdrawing from the area. Later, under Hattusilis III (ca. 1275-1250), the two countries arranged a peace treaty and a dynastic marriage. Then during the rule of Tudhalija IV (ca. 1250-1220), problems arose especially with the country of Ahhija [or Ahhijawa], often equated with the Achaeans i.e. Mycenaean Greeks. Early in the next century the kingdom was utterly destroyed and its capital city, like Troy before it, was burned.

Vestiges of Hittite power survived for a while in Syria, and other Anatolian languages were attested throughout the first millennium B.C., but the Hittite language died out and Anatolia remained fragmented for four centuries. The Hittites were mentioned as a people in Joshua 3:10, which is the source of the name now applied to them; and Uriah, husband of the beautiful Bathsheba and commander of a division of David's army, is identified as a Hittite in 2 Samuel 11:3 and elsewhere. Yet the identity of the Hittite people was lost to history until their magnificent library was dug out of the rubble and ash of Boğazköy.

The Hittite Documents
Among the Hittite documents, those dealing with religious concerns make up a greater share than those dealing with statecraft. But more of the statecraft texts are presented here for several reasons, among them that they provide information on the second millennium B.C. in the Middle East and also because the religious texts are much alike, following the same general pattern. Examples of the three types of religious texts are illustrated in the last three lessons: prayer, ritual, and festival.

Among the prayers, the most frequent type was the arkuwar; the petitioner treats the situation as though he has been accused of some crime for which he may make confession, even admitting of his blame. Presumably the god will then make a judgment. In the mugawar the petitioner simply calls on the mercy of the god to abandon his hostility.

The rituals are highly structured, as described in the introduction to Lesson 9. They are performed by a priest or priestess, known in the lesson and in other descriptions of rituals as Old Woman. She takes the worshipper through the various steps that will remove his shortcoming and restore him to a healthy condition.

While prayers and rituals concern individuals, festivals concern the entire community. They are performed especially at the crucial occasions for success in agriculture, at the time of sowing in spring between the middle of March and the middle of June, and at the time of reaping in the fall, between September and November. Festival texts deal with liturgies, lists of the items to be used in the ceremonies, the food and drinks for the god and his worshippers, and their involvement through song, dance, and also sports. They often included processions to holy sites. Reliefs on monuments at some of the most important sites, as at Alaca höyük and Yazılıkaya, may reflect these. They as well as many other accounts indicate the importance of festivals for the Hittites.

Lesson 1
Sara E. Kimball and Jonathan Slocum
The so-called Proclamation of Anittas deals with events leading up to the founding of the Hittite state and is the earliest genuinely historical text found at Boğazköy. A distinctive characteristic of Hittite culture is their writing of history that attempts to draw conclusions from events. Historical texts center around the king as hero. Generally wiser and braver than his subordinates, he is the person who carries the day when the actions of the enemy or those of the king's subordinates threaten the Hittite military with defeat. In later texts, especially those of the Empire period, the king's success is usually attributed to divine protection and sometimes divine intervention in the course of events. One possible interpretation of a problematic line in this text is that the deified throne dais, Halmasuiz, led Anittas to victory over Hattusas. If this is correct, it foreshadows the latter theme of divine aid. Anittas himself was a real person who was active during the time of the Assyrian merchant colonies, the petty king, or strong man, ruling the city of Kussara. The city-states that Anittas conquers, Nesa, the city which the Hittites considered their city of origin, Zalpuwa, a city in northern Anatolia near the Black sea, and, of course, Hattusas, which was later the Hittite capital, were all important places during the Hittite empire.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The Anittas document is preserved in a copy written in the Old Kingdom period and in later copies, and it exhibits a number of archaic features of grammar and writing. The beginning of the document, with its Akkadian imperative QIBIMA "speak!" follows the pattern of early Akkadian letters in which the document itself is commanded to reveal its contents, something not found in later Hittite historical texts.

One of the culturally intriguing aspects of this text is the god DSiu-summin "our god," or "Our Sius," a god who appears nowhere else in Hittite texts. The word sius, which is otherwise the generic word meaning "god," is derived from Indo-European *dyeus, the father god of the sky. Anatolian speakers seem to have brought the worship of this god into Anatolia, since cognates exist in the other Anatolian languages and refer to a solar deity. It is not entirely clear whether the expression is to be translated as "our god" or "Our Sius", though the age of the text and the fact that the noun sius is twice found with an enclitic possessive pronoun in a combination that has undergone an archaic sound change, suggest that the latter interpretation is possible. Although neither Anittas nor his father Pithanas bore an Indo-European name, the struggle over possession of the god's statue might indicate that they venerated a god of Indo-European origin. This may suggest that the people later known to us as Hittites were an ethnically mixed group of speakers of an Indo-European language and indigenous Hattic inhabitants of Anatolia. The extracts given below record the deeds of Anittas' father Pithana, the beginning of Anittas' career, the rescue of DSiu-summin from the king of Zalpuwa, and Anittas' destruction of the city of Hattusas. Since Anittas places a curse on anyone who tries to settle Hattusas after he has devastated it, and sows weeds over the site as a way of rendering the land unfit for cultivation, it is puzzling that roughly 100 years later the first Hittite king from whose reign we have documents, Hattusilis I, founded the Hittite capital there.

Translation
Anitta, Son of Pithana, King of Kussara, speak! He was dear to the Stormgod of Heaven, and when he was dear to the Stormgod of Heaven, the king of Nesa [verb broken off] to the king of Kussara. The king of Kussara, Pithana, came down out of the city in force, and he took the city of Nesa in the night by force. He took the King of Nesa captive, but he did not do any evil to the inhabitants of Nesa; instead, he made them mothers and fathers. After my father, Pithana, I suppresed a revolt in the same year. Whatever lands rose up in the direction of the sunrise, I defeated each of the aforementioned.
Previously, Uhna, the king of Zalpuwas, had removed our Sius from the city of Nesa to the city of Zalpuwas. But subsequently, I, Anittas, the Great King, brought our Sius back from Zalpuwas to Nesa. But Huzziyas, the king of Zalpuwas, I brought back alive to Nesa. The city of Hattusas [tablet broken] contrived. And I abandoned it. But afterwards, when it suffered famine, my goddess, Halmasuwiz, handed it over to me. And in the night I took it by force; and in its place, I sowed weeds. Whoever becomes king after me and settles Hattusas again, may the Stormgod of Heaven smite him!
Grammar
1 The Sound System
Given the limitations of the cuneiform syllabary and the fact that there are no current speakers of Hittite, the exact pronunciation of Hittite will never be known. However there is consensus on some major points. The following description takes into account some points of controversy but omits many minor details.

1.1 Vowels
Old Hittite had at least three short vowel phonemes and three long vowel phonemes. Subsequent sound change may have altered this system somewhat. At least there are indications that sound change altered the distribution of some of these sounds.

Short Vowels	 	Front	 	 	 	Back
High	 	[i]	 	 	 	[u]
Mid	 	[e]	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	[a]	 	 
Long vowels are indicated by double writing, also called plene writing, for example: da-a-at-ti [dāti] 'you take', pe-e-da-as [pēdas] '(s)he took away', or i-it [īd] 'go!' (see section 2.2). There is no evidence for back rounded mid vowels [o] and [ō]. Indo-European *a and *o had probably merged in a-type vowels by the time the Hittite texts are attested, and there is no evidence that sound change created new o-type vowels. Hittite may also have had two mid front close vowel phonemes that were pronounced like the vowels of English bet and bed, although the existence and distribution of these vowels is not a matter of general agreement.

Long Vowels	 	Front	 	 	 	Back
High	 	[ī]	 	 	 	[ū]
Mid	 	[ē]	 	 	 	 
Low	 	 	 	[ā]	 	 
1.2 Diphthongs
There are several diphthongs, although the exact number is under dispute. [āi] and [āu] were probably long diphthongs, from several sources. It is not clear whether there were also two corresponding short diphthongs [ai] and [au]. There were probably also at least three other diphthongs: [eu], [iu], and [ui], which were created by various sound changes. The length of the vowel element in these diphthongs is not known.

1.3 Stops
There were eight stops, and there is no evidence to indicate that their distribution was affected by sound change during the 500 years during which Hittite was written.

 	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Velar	 	Labiovelar
 	 	[p]	 	[t]	 	[k]	 	[kw]
 	 	[b]	 	[d]	 	[g]	 	[gw]
Some scholars consider [p], [t], [k] and [kw] to have been voiceless stops, and [b], [d], [g] and [gw] to have been voiced stops. Other scholars, however, consider the first series to have been fortis, or long, stop consonants and the second series to have been lenis, or short, stops. Members of the first series are written as double consonants between vowels (for example, a-ap-pa adv. 'back' [āpa]), and members of the second are written as single consonants (e.g., a-pa-a-at 'it' [abāt]). See section 2. There is also some evidence for the existence of true geminate, or doubled, stops, for example perhaps at-ta-as 'father' [attas], though the distribution of such sounds is disputed.

1.4 Glides, Nasals, and Liquids
There were two glides, a palatal [y] and a labial [w]. There were also at least two nasal phonemes [n] and [m] and two liquid phonemes [l] and [r]. Nasals and liquids are written double in a number of contexts, and the evidence suggests that [n], [m], [l], and [r] were opposed to geminate, or doubled, nasals and liquids. In some cases a clear contrast can be established, indicating that the difference was at least in part phonemic, e.g., a-a-ri '(s)he arrives' [āri] as opposed to a-ar-ri '(s)he washes' [ārri].

1.5 Fricatives and Affricates
Hittite had at least one voiceless dental fricative [s], which may have contrasted with a geminate [ss]. The existence of corresponding voiced [z] and [zz] is uncertain. Hittite probably also had at least two h-like phonemes from the Indo-European (IE) laryngeals *h₂ and *h₃. IE *h₃ was retained only initially, and it is unclear whether it was distinct from the descendant of *h₂, which was also retained initially. Between vowels, there are two sounds [h] and [hh], which are both descended from *h₂, and which may have been voiced and voiceless, or fortis and lenis, counterparts of one another. There was at least one affricate, [ts], which is spelled with signs containing Z.

1.6 References on Hittite Phonology
For more detailed current analyses of the Hittite sound system see H.C. Melchert, Anatolian Historical Phonology, Amsterdam-Atlanta, GA, 1994, and S.E. Kimball, Hittite Historical Phonology, Innsbruck, 1999. The two books differ in emphasis and arrangement, and although they are in basic agreement on a number of issues, they disagree on others. This account tries to present some of the differences.

2 The Cuneiform Syllabary
Hittite is written in a form of the cuneiform syllabary, a writing system in use in Sumerian city-states in Mesopotamia by roughly 3100 B.C.E. and used to write a number of languages in the ancient Near East until the first century B.C.E. Most documents in cuneiform were produced by impressing a wedge-shaped stylus cut from a reed into tablets of moist clay, and the name cuneiform, applied to the writing by modern scholars, means "wedge-shaped." In the early third millennium B.C.E. speakers of dialects of Akkadian, a Semitic language, conquered the Sumerian city states, and by approximately 2350 B.C.E. documents were written in cuneiform in Akkadian. Sumerian, a long extinct language, is related to no known language, ancient or modern, and its structure differed from that of Akkadian, which made it necessary to modify the writing system. These modifications are important, because the Hittites borrowed them when they borrowed the writing system, probably from a north Syrian source, in the early second millennium B.C.E. In borrowing this system, the Hittites retained conventions established for writing Sumerian and Akkadian and made few undisputed innovations of their own. For the use of Sumerian and Akkadian in Hittite texts, see section 3.

Unlike an alphabet, in which characters, or letters, represent single sounds, a syllabary is a form of writing in which characters, or signs, represent syllables. Most of the signs that stand for syllabic values are of the shape: V = vowel, CV = consonant + vowel, or VC = vowel plus consonant. There are also a number of signs used to represent sequences of the shape CVC = Consonant-Vowel-Consonant. A standard convention for transcribing Hittite texts is to separate each sign with a hyphen. For example, in the Hittite version of the syllabary the signs AT, TA, and AS (at-ta-as) represent attas 'father' and the signs TAR, RA, AN, ZI (tar-ra-an-zi) represent taranzi 'they speak'.

2.1 Spellings for Consonants
There are some important points to bear in mind about the relationship of the syllabary to the probable pronunciation of Hittite. Because of the spelling practices of the version of Akkadian cuneiform that the Hittites borrowed, the transcription of stops as voiced or voiceless is neither a reliable guide to Hittite pronunciation nor to Indo-European etymology. Signs with T, K, or Q, a sign used for a particular type of consonant in Akkadian, can reflect etymologically voiced or voiceless sounds; for example:

a-ta-an-zi, a-da-an-zi 'they eat', and e-te-er 'they ate' pronounced: [adantsi] and [ēder] from the IE root *h₁ed-;
pe-e-da-an, pe-e-di, pe-e-ti 'place' pronounced [pēdan] and [pēdi] from IE *pedom;
te-e-eh-hi 'I put', da-it-ti and ta-it-ti 'you (sg.) put', da-a-i '(s)he puts', ti-ya-an-zi 'they put' pronounced [dēhhi], [dāiti], [dāi], and [diyantsi] from the IE stem *dheh₁y-;
ge-e-nu, ke-nu-un 'knee' pronounced [gēnu], [gēnun] from IE *genu-;
ke-es-sar-az 'from the hand' pronounced [gissrats] from IE *ghesr-;
du-ug-ga-a-ri, du-uq-qa-a-ri, tu-uq-qa-a-ri 'is important' pronounced [tukāri] from the IE root *tuk-;
ku-en-zi '(s)he kills' pronounced [gwēntsi] from IE *ghwenti.
The reasons for this are complicated. The original version of the syllabary didn't regularly distinguish voiced and voiceless stops in vowel-plus-stop signs. Such signs are transcribed according to the value of a following sign. For example, the sign transcribed as UK or UG in du-ug-ga-a-ri, du-uq-qa-a-ri and tu-uq-qa-a-ri is the same sign, but the signs that follow it are GA and QA. Even where the syllabary theoretically offered ways of indicating a distinction, for example as is the case with most CV signs and many CVC signs, the distinction was not indicated. The original syllabary could distinguish PV from BV, but the Hittites normally used only the former in writing words syllabically. Thus PV signs can indicate [pV] or [bV]; for example: pa-a-ah-hur 'fire' pronounced [pāhur] (IE root *peh₂) but par-ku-us 'high', pronounced [bargus] (IE root *bhergh-).

Between vowels, doubled stops usually indicate etymologically voiceless stops, while single stops indicate etymologically voiced stops; for example: a-ap-pa 'after' pronounced [āpa] (IE *apō) but a-pa-a-as 'that' pronounced [abās] (IE *h₁obho-) or ú-e-ek-ka-an-zi 'they ask' pronounced [wekantsi] (IE *wek-) but te-e-kan 'earth' pronounced [dēgan] (IE *dheghōm).

Liquids, nasals, [s], and [h] may also be written single or double between vowels. Sometimes, they are also written this way before or after consonants, but there is little agreement on the interpretation of these spellings. The glide [y] may be represented with the sign I, for example: i-e-et '(s)he made' [yēt], si-i-e-es-sar 'beer' [syēssar], i-ú-ga-an 'yoke' [yugan], or pi-an-zi 'they give' [pyantsi]. Between a-vowels it is often represented with YA (e.g., sal-la-ya-as 'big' (gen. sg.) [sallayas]), and before [a] it is often spelled Ci-ya (e.g., pi-ya-an-zi 'they give' [pyantsi]). Before [a] it is often represented with I-YA (e.g., i-ya-an-zi 'they make' [yantsi]). The glide [w] tends to be written with WA before [a] (e.g., wa-a-tar 'water' [wādar]) and with the signs U and Ú before other vowels; the latter tends to be favored before I and E, for example: ú-e-el-lu-wa-as 'meadow' [wēllwas]. A spelling CU-WA- or Ú-WA-, U-WA- may be used to indicate the sequence [wa], for example: ú-wa-an-du 'let them look' [wantu], u-wa-it-ta-ri '(s)he sees' (3 sg. midd.) [waitari], and ú-wa-a-tar 'water' [wādar]. There is no evidence to indicate that the signs U and Ú ("u-two") indicated different sounds.

Signs transcribed with Z indicate a sound [ts] like the final two sounds of the English word cats, for example zi-ik 'you' (nom. sg.) [tsik], az-zi-ik-kan-zi 'they keep on eating' [atsikantsi], pa-a-iz-zi '(s)he goes' [pāitsi], par-na-az 'from the house' [parnats]. Any evidence for the use of Z to indicate the voiced counterpart of [s] (i.e., with a value like that of English z in zoo) is limited and controversial.

2.2 Spellings for Vowels
Vowels may be doubled by writing CV-V, V-VC or CV-V-VC, a device sometimes known as plene writing. In many cases, this is done to indicate long vowels; for example: da-a-i '(s)he takes' [dāi], ka-a-an-ki 'it hangs' [gānki], i-it (imp.) 'go' [īd], ak-ku-us-ke-e-wa-ni 'we keep drinking' [akwskēwani], si-i-e-es-sar 'beer' [syēssar], and as-su-u 'goods' (neut. pl.) [āssū]. The use of plene writing to indicate long vowels is not necessarily consistent. Generally, however, it's used more often in older texts than in more recent ones.

The version of the cuneiform syllabary used by the Hittites did not always allow the front vowels [e], [ē] and [i], [ī] to be distinguished. Signs with front vowel plus stop were indifferent to the distinction. Thus, the sign composed of front vowel plus dental stop could be read as [et], [ed], [it], or [id]. Sometimes plene writing or etymological knowledge allows us to discriminate the vowel. For example, e-et 'eat' (imp.) is from IE *eh₁d and should be read as [ēd], but i-it 'go' (imp.) is from IE *ih₁dhi and is read [īd]. Some CV signs for stop plus vowel did not allow the distinction to be made (e.g., KI can represent [ki], [ke], [ge], or [gi]). Other CV signs for stop plus vowel, however, allowed the distinction to be indicated (e.g., there is one sign for TE and another for TI). Many CV and VC signs with other types of consonants also allowed the distinction (e.g., SE vs. SI, HE vs. HI, ME vs. MI, EL vs. IL, EN vs. IN, and ES vs. IS), but the distinction was not always preserved in spelling. For example, after consonants, the nominative plural ending, which was [-ēs], is found as -CE-E-ES, -CE-ES, -CI-IS, and even -CE-IS and CI-ES. There are a number of reasons for this apparent anarchy. The source from which the Hittites borrowed cuneiform probably did not observe a distinction between [e] and [i] or [ē] and [ī] consistently. Sometimes the Hittite scribes preferred one sign over another regardless of its value in the syllabary. For example, HI, which is a less complex sign than HE, is much more common than HE. ZE, which is more complicated than ZI, is quite rare. Sometimes the use of one sign instead of another seems to have been a matter of habit. DI, for example, is hardly ever found at the beginnings of words, although TI and TE are. Both TI and DI may be found at the ends of words, though TE is relatively rare in this position. It is also possible that at some point the long vowel [ī] and [ē] and the short vowels [i] and [e] had merged, at least in some phonological environments, but such a merger is subject to considerable dispute.

2.3 Spellings for Consonant Clusters
We know that Hittite had initial, internal, and final consonant clusters. But, because the syllabary offers no way of writing a consonant that is not preceded or followed by a vowel, such clusters sometimes had to be written with a so-called "dead" vowel; that is a vowel that is written but not pronounced. In the clearest cases, the designated dead vowel is A, written CA or AC. Some examples are pa-ra-a 'forth, to' [pr:a], par-as-du-us 'foliage' [parstus], e-ez-za-at-te-en 'eat' (2 pl. imp.) [ētsten], ka-a-as-za 'hunger' [kāsts], and ki-is-sa-ri beside ki-is-ri 'in the hand' [gissrī]. Descendents of IE words in initial *s plus stop are normally written with the initial sign IS, (e.g., is-ta-na-a-an-as 'at the altar tables' from the IE root *stah₂-), though forms of the verb meaning "make a libation" (from IE *spend-) are written with SI-PV (e.g., si-pa-an-ti '(s)he makes a libation') except in the early period, where a spelling with IS-P is occasionally found (e.g., is-pa-an-ti '(s)he makes a libation'). It is possible that the initial IS represents a genuine vowel, in which case a spelling is-ta-na-a-na-as would represent [istanānas], indicating a development comparable to the development of an initial vowel before [s] plus stop in Spanish (e.g. espada 'sword' from Latin spatha). However, it is also possible that IS was a sign with the dead vowel used as a fairly conventional spelling for initial clusters of [s] plus stop, in which case the spelling is-ta-na-a-an-as would represent [stanānas].

3 The Use of Sumerian and Akkadian
Since the Cuneiform syllabary was invented by Sumerians and later borrowed and adapted by speakers of the Semitic language Akkadian, the Hittite scribes inherited a number of writing conventions from Sumerian and Akkadian. The most notable of these is the use of Sumerian and Akkadian words as ideograms representing Hittite words and distinguishing grammatical functions. The typical Hittite text is a mixture of syllabic writing of Hittite words, Sumerian, Akkadian, and odd hybrids in which Hittite syllabic writing is combined with Sumerian and/or Akkadian or in which Akkadian and Sumerian are combined.

3.1 Sumerograms
Although Hittite could be spelled with syllabic signs, the Hittite scribes also used Sumerian signs (or Sumerograms) ideographically. In other words, a word might be written in Sumerian, but it was read in Hittite. This is a practice that the Hittites borrowed and adapted from Akkadian cuneiform, which also used Sumerograms. In transcribing Hittite texts, it is conventional to render Sumerograms in capitals. For example, the Hittite word for "king" was usually written as LUGAL, the Sumerian word for "king," but we know that when a text was read, the word was pronounced in Hittite as [hāssus]. Similarly, the Sumerogram EN 'lord, master' was read in Hittite as [ishās], and HUL 'evil, bad' was read as Hittite [idālu]. The Sumerian plural markers MEŠ, HI.A, and DIDLI were also used to indicate plurals. For example, we find ŠEŠ 'brother' (Hitt. nom. sg. [negnas]) beside ŠEŠMEŠ 'brothers' (Hitt. nom. pl. [negnēs]), UDU 'sheep' (Hitt. nom. sg. *[pekkus] or [yants]) beside plural UDUHI.A, or URU 'city' (Hitt. nom.sg. [happeriyas]) beside plural URUDIDLI. Occasionally, one finds two Sumerian plural markers attached to a word, for example, ERINMEŠHI.A 'troops' or URUDIDLI.HI.A 'cities'.

3.2 Phonetic Complements
Often, probably to distinguish grammatical function, to disambiguate synonyms, or simply to remind the scribe of the Hittite reading, Sumerograms were followed by one or more syllables to indicate the reading. Such syllabic tags are called phonetic complements, and they are another practice borrowed from Akkadian. For example, The sentence LUGAL a-us-zi could mean either "(S)he sees the king" or "The king observes." However, LUGAL-us a-us-zi with the syllabic complement -us indicating that LUGAL is to be read in Hittite as nominative singular [hāssus] clearly means "The king observes" (pronounced [hāssus austsi]). But LUGAL-un a-us-zi with the syllabic complement -un, indicating that the word for "king" is accusative singular ([hāssun]) clearly means that someone sees the king (pronounced [hāssun austsi]). The spelling UDU-us 'sheep' (nom. sg.) indicates that the Hittite word underlying the Sumerogram was a u-stem (probably *[pekkus], which is not attested in syllabic writing). HUL-lu-un (Sumerian HUL 'evil' plus Hittite phonetic complement -lu-un) was read as "evil" (noun or adjective) accusative singular (in Hittite, [idālun]), but HUL-ah-mi (HUL plus phonetic complement -ah-mi) was read as first person singular present [idālawahmi] 'I (will) harm, I (will) do evil'. As with words written in Hittite, Sumerograms are also found with enclitic pronouns and particles, for example: LUGAL-ma-mu UDU pa-is 'But the king gave the sheep to me.' Enclitics could also follow phonetic complements; for example: LUGAL-us-ma-mu a-us-zi 'The king sees me'. (LUGAL = "the king" plus -us indicating nominative singular, plus enclitic conjunction -ma 'but' plus first person singular accusative-dative enclitic personal pronoun -mu 'to me'.)

3.3 Akkadograms and Use of Akkadian
The Hittite scribes also used Akkadian words as ideograms. Such words, called Akkadograms, are conventionally italicized in transcriptions of Hittite texts and they may be capitalized to distinguish them as Akkadograms as opposed to Akkadian words borrowed into Hittite. (The Hittites did borrow some words from Akkadian; for example: Hittite tuppi 'tablet' from Akk. tuppu, ultimately from Sum. dub.) For example, the Hittite word ish:as, 'lord, master' could not only be written in Sumerian as EN but also in Akkadian as BEL (Akk. bēlu). The third person singular preterit of Akkadian ṣābatu 'seize', for example, is sometimes used as an Akkadogram IṢ-BAT to stand for for Hittite ēpta 'seized'. Akkadian was a more highly inflected language than Sumerian, with endings for gender, case and number in the noun and adjective and endings for number, tense, gender and aspect in the verb. These endings were sometimes written in Hittite texts. For example, we find inflected forms of the Akkadogram meaning "lord, master": nom. sg. BE-LU and gen. sg. BE-LAM. Similarly, the word for "father" is found as nom. sg. ABU and gen. sg. ABI. Akkadian also had a special form of the noun, called the construct state (essentially the stem), to which enclitic possessive pronouns were added (e.g., Akk. ab-ī 'my father', abi-ya 'of my father'). The Hittites used these Akkadian possessive pronouns too, but their Akkadian was often faulty, and one finds Akkadograms like ABI-YA, or BĒLI-YA with the pronoun attached to the Akkadian genitive. Sometimes such forms were used syntactically as nominatives, vocatives, or accusatives. Akkadian possessive pronouns could also be used with Sumerograms (e.g., DUMU-ŠU 'his son'). Although Akkadograms were pronounced in Hittite, in writing combinations of nouns and possessive ponouns, the scribes followed Akkadian spelling rules. When possessive suffixes beginning in š were attached to Akkadian words ending in dental stops, the suffixes were spelled with z in the version of Akkadian which the Hittites borrowed, indicating a pronunciation [-ts]. For example, in Akkadian, qāt 'hand' plus the third person singular suffix šu is spelled quazzu. The Hittite scribes followed this practice in writing the suffixes after Sumerograms when the Akkadian equivalent ended in a dental stop, even if neither the Sumerogram nor the underlying Hittite word had a final dental stop. For example, the Hittite word for "land" or "country" was [udnē]. It is often spelled with the Sumerogram KUR, and spellings for "his country" as KUR-ZU, reflecting Akkadian mā-zu for māt 'country' plus possessive suffix -šu are sometimes found.

The scribes used Hittite phonetic complements with Akkadian words less commonly than they did with Sumerian, perhaps because Sumerian was a dead language by the second millennium but Akkadian was a living language used, for example, by the Hittites in diplomatic correspondence. Akkadian could also be used to indicate grammatical relations among Hittite words. For example, the Akkadian prepositions ina, 'in, into' and ana 'to' were used as Akkadograms to indicate the dative and locative as in: IN-A ÉGAL 'into the palace', INA URUHattusi, 'in the city of Hattusas', A-NA TUPPI 'on the tablet', or I-NA kisri-ssi 'in his hand'. The Akkadian preposition ša was used as an Akkadogram to indicate the Hittite genitive, e.g., ŠA LUGAL-u-wa-as 'of the king'. Since Hittite could indicate these relations both with case forms (e.g., hāssuwas 'of the king' or tuppiyas 'of the tablet') and with postpositions (e.g., udnē andan 'in(to) the country') such prepositions serve as graphic indicators only; they were not pronounced. One often finds the dative-locative, for example, marked three times (e.g., I-NA par-ni an-da-an 'into the house' = Akk prep. INA 'into' + Hitt dat. sg. parni 'into the house' + Hitt. postposition andan 'into'). Finally, although Hittite had enclitic and free-standing conjunctions, the Akkadogram Ú could be used to indicate 'and'.

Fragments of Akkadian could also be used after Sumerograms as phonetic complements; for example: DINGIRLUM (from Sumerian DINGIR 'god' plus Akkadian nominative singular ilum 'god'), DINGIRLIM (from DINGIR plus Akkadian genitive singular ilim), or DUMU-ru from Sumerian DUMU 'son' plus Akkadian -ru from nom. sg. māru 'son'). Again, the scribes' command of Akkadian was spotty, and a form like DINGIRLIM was not restricted to the genitive (e.g., with Akkadian phonetic complement from the genitive ilim and Hittite phonetic complement -ni indicating the dative DINGIR-LIM-ni 'to the god' (pronounced in Hittite as [siuni]).

3.4 Determinatives
A characteristic of Sumerian cuneiform that was borrowed by both the Akkadians and the Hittites is the use of determinatives. These are signs that were not pronounced (though most could be used as independent Sumerograms) that indicated what class of items a particular word belonged to. Although most determinatives precede the words they specify, a few customarily follow. One common way of distinguishing determinatives from words in modern transcriptions of cuneiform texts is to superscript the determinatives. For example, the sign GIŠ, which could be used as an independent Sumerogram meaning "wood" or "tree," was also used as a determinative for objects customarily made of wood, such as: Sumerogram GIŠBANŠUR 'table', or Hittite GIŠhapūti, a type of chair. Similarly, the sign URU, used independently to write the word for "city," usually preceded the names of cities or settled areas; for example: URUHa-at-tu-sa-as '(the city of) Hattusas'. The sign MUŠEN, meaning 'bird', was also used as a determinative following the names of birds, for example, ha-ra-a-asMUŠEN 'eagle' (or, as a Sumerogram with a determinative, ÁMUŠEN). Divine names were preceded by the determinative DINGIR 'god', which in modern transcription is normally abbreviated D (e.g., DTe-le-pe-nu-us, a god of vegetation). Determinatives were also used indicate the sex of persons referred to by proper names or occupational titles. The sign MUNUS, used independently to mean "wife" or "woman," preceded names of women. When it precedes women's names it may be rendered in transcriptions as superscript F (e.g. FPu-du-he-pa, Puduhepa, the name of a powerful Hittite queen of the thirteenth century B.C.E. and wife of Hattusilis III). Before the names of men a single vertical stroke was used. This is often rendered in transcriptions as superscript M (e.g. MTe-le-pe-nu-us, the name of an early Hittite king). Before male occupational titles, the Sumerian sign LÚ 'man' was used (e.g., LÚA.ZU 'physician' or 'ritual healer'), and the sign MUNUS was used before female occupational titles, e.g., MUNUSŠU.GI, or, in Hittite, MUNUShāsawas 'wise woman, female ritual healer'. The use of determinatives is somewhat like the use of signs like $ or % in English to indicate that what follows is a sum of money or that what precedes is a percentage, although we typically pronounce the non-phonetic signs in, e.g., $100 and 60%, saying "one hundred dollars" (or "one hundred bucks") and "sixty percent."

3.5 Rebus Spellings
Finally, so-called "rebus spellings" involving the use of homonyms were used, especially in writing proper names. This is a strategy comparable to writing the English phrase "I see" with a picture of an eye followed by wavy lines to indicate the waves of the sea, or modern Internet abbreviations such as CU l8tr for "See you later." For example, the word for "man" in Luvian is ziti, and it is an element in a number of names of men in later Hittite. The proper name Uhhaziti is spelled with both Hittite syllables and the Sumerogram LÚ 'man' as MU-uh-ha-LÚ in the Annals of Mursilis. One gets the impression that the scribes were having fun with such punning spellings.

4 Active verbs
Compared with the classical languages, Greek and Latin, Hittite has a verb system that is fairly simple. There are two types of endings for active verbs: "mi-endings," which characterize the mi-conjugation and "hi-endings," which characterize the hi-conjugation. Both conjugations include verbs that are transitive, intransitive, and stative. The verb system has two voices, active and middle; the latter is also used as a passive. The verb also has two tenses, present and preterit, or past. The present, often accompanied by appropriate adverbs, is used for the future. The verb system also has two moods: indicative and imperative; the optative and subjunctive of other ancient IE languages are lacking. Modal, aspectual, and other nuances of meaning can, however, be distinguished through the use of adverbial particles, through the addition of derivational suffixes, and through the use of periphrastic constructions. The imperative also has modal functions. Each active conjugation and the middle show some variation in the forms of particular endings. This variation is sometimes the result of the language having inherited variant forms. However, it is often the result of sound changes and analogical innovations, some of which took place in the prehistoric period and some of which can be observed by looking at texts composed at different periods.

4.1 Active Endings
The conjugations take their names from the form of the first person singular present, which is -mi in the mi-conjugation and -hhi in the hi-conjugation. It is only in the singular of the present, preterit, in the third person singular imperative, and partially in the second person singular imperative that the distinction between the two conjugations is maintained; both share a set of endings in the present, preterit, imperative plural, and first person singular imperative. Although we speak of mi- and hi-conjugation forms, each conjugation influenced the other. Some verbs may occur with endings from both conjugations.

Some of the endings provided in the paradigms below have doubled consonants. In the cuneiform syllabary, however, spellings with doubled consonants are only possible after vowels. Such spellings are regular for endings beginning with dental stops or [hh], but the third person singular present mi-conjugation ending may be spelled -zzi or -zi after vowels.

4.3 Paradigms of mi-conjugation verbs
The following are paradigms of two common mi-verbs, ēs- 'be' and daske-, the iterative of dā- 'take'. The former has a stem that alternates between ēs- and as-. The iterative is composed of a root da- to which a suffix that takes the form -ske- or -ska- is added; thus the stem of the iterative is daske-, daska-. In the second person singular imperative of the iterative, the stem final vowel [-e] regularly becomes [-i] in final position. Since not all forms of these verbs are attested, where possible, reconstructions based on attested forms of similar verbs are indicated with an asterisk. Blanks indicate unattested forms for which reconstructions cannot be made with confidence.

4.4 Paradigms of hi-conjugation verbs
The following are paradigms of two common hi-conjugation verbs. The first verb, ār- 'arrive, reach', a consonant stem, shows an alternation between long and short root vowels. The third person singular preterit of ār- is spelled a-ar-sa, ar-sa, and a-ar-as, indicating that it was probably pronounced [ārs]. The verb dā- 'take' has a stem that alternates between [dā-] and [d-]. The ending -umēni of the first person plural preterit indicates that a prehistoric form of the second person plural was *duweni, since a prehistoric sequence of *u followed by *w became um.

5 Gender and Case
Unlike Greek and Latin, Hittite distinguishes only two genders: animate (or common) and neuter. Some nouns attest both animate and neuter forms. There is evidence that within Indo-European the development of a true feminine gender was later than that of the masculine and neuter. Although it has been argued that the Anatolian languages reflect this early state of affairs, there is evidence that Anatolian did inherit a grammatical feminine but later lost it, and inherited masculine and feminine nouns merged in the animate. In the neuter singular and plural, the forms of the nominative and accusative are identical. Most animate nouns make a nominative singular in -s (from Indo-European *-s) and an accusative singular in -n (from Indo-European *-m). In the animate plural, the regular nominative ending was originally -ēs and the accusative plural ending was -us, though archaic texts attest a rare animate nominative plural ending -as. Both genders share case forms in the genitive, dative, ablative, instrumental and allative. (See subsequent lessons for more thorough discussions of the functions of the cases).

In the singular, there are seven regular case distinctions: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative-locative, ablative, instrumental, and allative. A handful of nouns and adjectives with the suffix -u make a distinct vocative, but the vocative was moribund, even in the early period. For direct address the nominative was normally used instead. A few nouns have a locative formed without a case ending. The allative eventually died out, its function, to indicate direction towards, being taken over by the dative-locative.

The plural shows a tendency to reduce the number of separate case endings. The distinction between the nominative plural in -ēs and the accusative plural in -us is maintained in early texts, but in later texts forms with the original nominative ending -ēs may show up in accusative function and forms with the accusative -us may show up in nominative function. The most common neuter nominative-accusative plural ending is -a. However, a few neuter nouns and adjectives that do not take this ending show lengthening of the vowel of a suffix, at least in early texts. An archaic genitive plural ending -an (from Indo-European *-o:m) is found sporadically in early texts, but it was eventually replaced by the ending -as, identical to the ending of the dative-locative plural. A few nouns attest an instrumental plural ending -it. Sample paradigms of nouns and adjectives made from various stem forms will be provided in subsequent lessons.

5.1 Noun and Adjective Endings
Singular	 	Anim.	 	 	 	Neut.
nom.	 	-s	 	 	 	-n
acc.	 	-n	 	 	 	-n
gen.	 	 	 	-as	 	 
dloc.	 	 	 	-i	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	-az

gen.	 	 	 	-as	 	 
dat.	 	 	 	-as	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	-az	 	 
The animate nominative singular ending is spelled -s after stems ending in vowels or dipthongs, for example: at-ta-as 'father' = [attas], or ú-e-el-lu-us 'meadow' = [wēllus]. The nominative ending appears as -za, prepresenting a pronunciation [ts] when it occurs with stems ending in dental stops (e.g., ka-a-as-za 'hunger' = [kāsts], or ap-pa-an-za 'captive' = [apānts]). The final consonant of the ending of the ablative singular and ablative-instrumental plural was pronounced [ts]. The ablative endings are normally spelled -az (e.g., ha-as-sa-a-az or É-az and par-na-az, both meaning 'from the house'), although sometimes a spelling -za is found. A few nouns attest an ablative ending -anza, pronounced [-ants] (e.g., lu-ut-ta-an-za 'window'). In some archaic paradigms, the instrumental ending has the form -ta or -da after consonants, (e.g., ú-i-ta-an-ta 'with water', but later ú-e-te-ni-it). After u-stems, the ending may show up as -t. (e.g., ge-nu-ut 'with the knee').

5.2 Sample A-stem Noun Paradigms
A-stems are nouns and adjectives which have stems ending in [-a-] or [-ā-] in the nominative and accusative singular. The first set of paradigms are for the animate nouns lāhha- 'expedition' and anna- 'mother' and for the neuter pēda- 'place'. Since particular forms of some words are not attested, reconstructed forms, marked with an asterisk, are given where reconstructions can be made with confidence. Blanks indicate unattested forms that cannot be reconstructed with confidence.

5.3 A-stem Adjectives
A-stem adjectives, like a-stem nouns, have a stem ending in -a- in the nominative and accusative singular. As adjectives, they may be declined as animate or neuter, depending on the case of the noun which they modify. The paradigm provided below gives forms of the adjective kūnna- 'right' (direction), 'favorable'. This adjective, though sometimes spelled out as ku-u-un-na-, is often written with the Sumerogram ZAG plus phonetic complement, providing information about the shape of the stem and endings. Forms with an asterisk are not attested but can be reconstructed with confidence on the model of other a-stem nouns and adjectives and by considering the phonetic complements attached to the Sumerogram ZAG.

Lesson 2
Sara E. Kimball and Jonathan Slocum
A number of the Hittite texts concern mythological topics from Sumerian or Hurrian sources. The Telepenus Myth provided in extract form here, however, is one of a group of myths known to modern scholars as "Old Anatolian Myths." These are stories, learned and adapted by the Hittites during the early years of their spread throughout Anatolia, that played various roles in Hittite religious cult. The Telepenus Myth is one of a group of Old Anatolian myths, which modern scholars term "Vanishing God" myths. In these, a deity is offended and stomps off angrily, or is otherwise removed from the world of gods and humans with dire consequences for that world. Telepenus, son of the Hattic Stormgod, was a god of agriculture. His angry departure leaves the divine, human, and, animal world suffering hunger, thirst, and, sterility as described in the extract. The theme of these "Vanishing God" myths is, of course, reminiscent of the Greek myth of Persephone.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text exists in several copies, the earliest of which follows the writing conventions of the Middle Hittite period, but is probably a copy of an even earlier version. For an English translation, see H. Hoffner, Hittite Myths 2nd. ed. Atlanta, GA, 1998, pp. 14-20. The very beginning of the Telepenus Myth is broken, so the exact cause of the deity's rage is not known. From what can be made out from the surviving fragments, however, the god was angry enough to have put his right shoe on his left foot and vice versa. After the failed feast described in the extract, the gods try various ways of finding Telepenus. The Sungod sends a swift eagle to fly over high mountains and deep valleys to look for him, but the eagle returns without success. Then the Stormgod searches for his son himself, again without luck. Finally, the Mother Goddess, Hannahanna, sends a bee. The little bee, although small and weak finds Telepenus asleep in a meadow and stings him awake. Needless to say, Telepenus is still very angry, but the gods appease him with various offerings in a ceremony that is a model of Hittite ritual practice. At the end of the story Telepenus releases the world from the consequences of his rage and departure, restoring the world to its normal order.

Hoffner translates it as "animal fecundity." Common nouns may sometimes be preceded by the Sumerian determinative D, indicating that they might be regarded in cultic worship as deified. For example halkis grain is sometimes found in ritual texts as Dhalkis, meaning something like "deified grain."

Translation
Mist seized the windows. Smoke seized the house. In the hearth the logs were stifled. At the altars the gods were stifled. In the sheepfold the sheep were stifled. In the cow barn the cows were stifled. The ewe rejected her lamb. The cow rejected her calf. But Telepenus had stomped away. He took away barley, fertility(?), growth, luxuriance(?), and abundance. To the steppe, to the meadow, to the swamps he went. Telepenus went to the swamp and hid himself in the swamp. Over him the halenzu-plant grew. Therefore barley and wheat do not ripen. Cows, sheep, and humans do not get pregnant. And those who are already pregnant cannot give birth. The mountains and the trees dried up; and the foliage does not come out. The meadows and springs dried up; and, in the land, famine came to pass. Humans and gods are perishing from hunger. The Great Sun God prepared a feast and invited the Thousand Gods. They ate but were not satiated; they drank but did not quench their thirst.
Grammar
6 Basic Word Order
Hittite sentences are normally verb-final, for example:

 	 	DTelepenus-a	 	arha	 	iyannis
 	 	but-Telepenus	 	away	 	stomped
 	 	"But Telepenus stomped away."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	SA	 	DIŠTAR	 	parā	 	handandatar	 	memahhi
 	 	of	 	Ishtar's	 	divine	 	predestination	 	I will tell
 	 	"I will tell of Ishtar's divine predestination."
6.1 Form of the Subject
Since person is marked by the verb endings, explicit pronominal subjects are not obligatory except with certain intransitive verbs (see below). Explicit tonic, or stressed, pronominal subjects may be used for emphasis or to clarify pronominal reference, as in:

LÚA.ZU-ya kussanapās-pat pāi
"The physician's fee he-himself provides."
In this sentence the subject, someone who has injured another person, appears as the stressed pronoun apās and it is strengthened with the emphasizing particle -pat.

Sometimes the subject's proper name is used for emphasis:

nuMTelepenus URUHattusi tuliyan halzihhun
"I,Telepenus, called the council in Hattusas."
Some intransitive verbs normally occur with enclitic subject pronouns if the sentence has no explicit subject. These include verbs of motion and certain verbs that indicate a change in the subject's state. The following are a few examples:

 	 	n-as	 	mahhan	 	wappui	 	ari
 	 	and-she	 	when	 	at the riverbank	 	arrives
 	 	"And when she arrives at the river bank..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at-mu	 	GÌRMEŠ-as	 	kattan	 	hāliyēr
 	 	they-to-me	 	the feet	 	down	 	bowed
 	 	"They prostrated themselves at my feet."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mān-as	 	lazziyatta-ma
 	 	when-he	 	recovers-but
 	 	"But when he recovers..."
6.2 Order of Elements
An explicit subject, whether it is a noun, a stressed pronoun, or an enclitic pronoun, normally heads the sentence, and direct and indirect objects that are not enclitic pronouns normally occur after it, as in the following:

 	 	GU4-ma	 	AMAR-ŠU	 	mimmas
 	 	the cow-but (subject)	 	calf-her (direct object)	 	rejected
 	 	"The cow rejected her calf."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	LÚSAGI-as	 	1	 	NINDA	 	GUR4-RA	 	GAL	 	LUGAL-i	 	pāi
 	 	the cupbearer (subject)	 	one	 	bread (direct object)	 	thick	 	large	 	to the king (indirect object)	 	gives.
 	 	"The cupbearer gives one large thick bread to the king."
For emphasis, other constituents, such as indirect objects, adverbial phrases, and direct objects may be moved to the front of the sentence:

 	 	ANA	 	MUhha-LÚ-ma	 	LÚTE4	 	MU	 	uwiyanun
 	 	to	 	Uhhaziti-moreover (indirect object)	 	a messenger (direct object)	 	I	 	sent
 	 	"Moreover, to Uhhaziti, I sent a messenger."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ANA	 	É.GAL	 	3	 	GÍN	 	KÙBABBAR	 	daskēr
 	 	for	 	the palace (indirect object)	 	three	 	shekels	 	of silver (direct object)	 	they used to take
 	 	"They used to take three shekels of silver for the palace."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	pahhur	 	ANA A.SÀ-ŠU	 	kuiski	 	pēdai
 	 	if	 	fire (direct object)	 	into his field (adverbial)	 	someone (subject)	 	brings
 	 	"If someone brings fire into his barn..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	1	 	NINDA	 	SIG	 	wappuwas	 	DMAH	 	parsiya
 	 	one	 	loaf (direct object)	 	thin	 	of the river bank	 	for the Mother Goddess (indirect object)	 	I crumble
 	 	"I crumble one thin loaf for the Mother Goddess of the river bank."
7 Use of the Nominative, Accusative, and Ergative
As in other IE languages, the nominative is the case in which the subject of a sentence appears, while the accusative is the case regularly used to indicate the direct objects of most verbs. Both the nominative and accusative, however, also have a few other functions in Hittite. For the use of the nominative as vocative, the case of direct address, see section 8.

7.1 The Nominative
In animate nouns, the singular subject is normally marked by the ending -s, which is spelled with the sign ZA (= [ts]) after stems ending in dental stops. The regular ending of the animate plural is -ēs, although archaic texts attest a few animate nominative plurals in -as from Indo-European *-ōs. Neuter nominatives and accusatives have the same form in both singular and plural. The animate nominative may be the subject of both intransitive and transitive verbs:

 	 	LÚkītas	 	halzāi
 	 	reciter (nominative)	 	calls out
 	 	"The reciter calls out..."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	GIŠluttaus	 	kammaras	 	IŠ-BAT
 	 	the windows	 	mist (nominative)	 	seized
 	 	"Mist seized the windows."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-za	 	LUGAL	 	MUNUS.LUGAL	 	esanda
 	 	and-themselves	 	king (nominative)	 	queen (nominative)	 	sit
 	 	"The king and queen seat themselves."
Predicate nominatives appear in the nominative case:

 	 	LUGAL-us-san	 	hantezziyas-pat	 	DUMU.LUGAL	 	DUMURU	 	kikkistaru
 	 	king (predicate nominative)	 	of-the-first-rank-only	 	a prince	 	a son	 	let become
 	 	"Let only a son, a prince of the first rank, become king."
The nominative is also the case form of the grammatical subject of passive sentences:

 	 	INA	 	GUNNI-ma	 	kalmisanis	 	wisuriyantati
 	 	in	 	the hearth	 	logs (nominative)	 	were stifled
 	 	"In the hearth, the logs were stifled."
Verbs indicating sickness may be used intransitively with a nominative subject (cf. English She sickened or He took sick).

 	 	nu MUhha-LÚ-is	 	kuit	 	GIG-at
 	 	Uhhaziti (nominative)	 	because	 	had sickened
 	 	"Because Uhhaziti had sickened..."
7.2 The Accusative
The accusative is the case in which the direct objects of most verbs appear:

 	 	nu GIŠkalmisanan	 	siyāit
 	 	a thunderbolt (accusative)	 	he hurled
 	 	"He hurled a thunderbolt."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu antuhsan	 	wiyanun
 	 	man (accusative)	 	I sent
 	 	"I sent a man."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu LUGAL-us	 	GAD-an	 	arha	 	pissiazi
 	 	the king	 	the towel (accusative)	 	away	 	throws
 	 	"The king throws the towel away."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	DUTU-us	 	liliwandan	 	haranan	 	piyēt
 	 	Sungod	 	swift (accusative)	 	eagle (accusative)	 	sent
 	 	"The Sungod sent a swift eagle."
Some verbs take two accusatives, a direct object and an objective complement:

 	 	n-us	 	arunas	 	erhus	 	yēt
 	 	and-them (direct object)	 	of the sea	 	borders (objective complement)	 	he made
 	 	"And he made them borders of the sea."
Hittite, like Greek and Latin, occasionally attests figura etymologica, or constructions in which the direct object, in the accusative, is a noun etymologically related to the verb or a noun with close semantic affinity to the verb:

 	 	hullanzan	 	hullanun
 	 	fight	 	I fought
 	 	"I fought a fight."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	memiyann-a-si	 	lē	 	mematti
 	 	word-and-to-him	 	don't	 	speak
 	 	"And don't speak a word to him."
With verbs indicating sickness, the word for the illness may occur in the nominative as subject of the sentence, while the noun referring to the person afflicted is the direct object and in the accusative case:

 	 	kappin DUMU-an	 	HUL-lu	 	GIG	 	GIG-at
 	 	little boy (accusative)	 	evil	 	sickness	 	was sick with
 	 	"The little boy experienced an evil sickness."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	tuk-ma	 	istarkkit
 	 	you (accusative)-but	 	took sick
 	 	"But you took sick."
7.3 Neo-Hittite Confusion of Animate Nominative and Accusative Endings
In late texts, the endings for the animate nominative and accusative plural are sporadically confused. A noun, personal pronoun, or adjective with nominative plural endings may be found in accusative function. For example, in this phrase from the treaty of Tudhaliya IV with Karunta (section 10), the animate nominative plural ending -is, (for -ēs) marks the direct object ZAG, a Sumerogram meaning "border," The relative pronoun which agrees with it is also nominative plural animate in form:

 	 	ZAGHI.A-is-si	 	kuyēs	 	tehhun
 	 	borders-for him	 	that	 	I have established
 	 	"The borders that I have established for him..."
7.4 The Ergative
Neuter nouns can be direct objects of transitive verbs:

 	 	takku	 	pahhur	 	ANA	 	A.SÀ-ŠU	 	kuiski	 	pēdai
 	 	if	 	fire (neuter)	 	into	 	barn-his	 	someone	 	brings
 	 	"If someone brings fire into his barn..."
They can also be subjects of intransitive verbs, as in the following:

 	 	nu	 	uttar	 	isduwati
 	 	plot(neuter)	 	became	 	known
 	 	"The plot became known."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	pahhur	 	kistari
 	 	fire (neuter)	 	goes out
 	 	"The fire goes out."
Neuter nouns do not, however, function as subjects of transitive verbs. Instead, when a noun that is neuter is the subject of a transitive verb it takes special endings, called ergative endings, -anza in the singular and -antēs in the plural. The function of these endings is to transfer the original neuter to the animate gender, for example:

 	 	mahhan-ta	 	kās tuppianza	 	anda wemiyazzi
 	 	when-you	 	this tablet (ergative)	 	finds
 	 	"As soon as this tablet reaches you..."
For the form of the ergative here, compare the neuter nominative-accusative singular tuppi 'tablet'. Note also that the demonstrative pronoun kās is animate nominative singular.

The ergative of pahhur 'fire' is made from the stem pahhuen- as in the genitive singular pahhuenas:

 	 	IGI-zin	 	pahhuenanza	 	karapi
 	 	first rank	 	fire (ergative)	 	consumes
 	 	"Fire consumes (those of) the first rank."
Compare the ergative plural ishisnantes (from ishessn-, stem of ishessar 'binding, strap') in:

 	 	SAG.DU-ann-a	 	ishisnantes	 	appanzi
 	 	head-and	 	bindings	 	seize
 	 	"And the bindings clasp the head."
8 U-Stem Adjectives and Nouns
U-stem nouns and adjectives are formed by adding a suffix containing -u-, which becomes [w] before vowels, to noun and adjective endings. The endings -s and -n are affixed to the suffix in the nominative and accusative singular animate. Nominative-accusative singular neuters end in the suffix -u. The nominative-accusative plural neuter may end in -u, which is probably to be read [-ū] with a lengthened vowel, although vowel length was indicated only sporadically. Plurals with a suffix and ending -uw-a are also found. The plural with lengthened stem vowel is an archaism, reflecting Indo-European *-u plus collective ending *-h₂, while the ending -a was adopted from other nouns and adjectives. Both endings occur in early texts, though the ending -a spread at the expense of -u.

8.1 Paradigms of u-stem adjectives
Forms other than the nominative and accusative singular have a suffix -au- (-aw- before vowels), at least in early texts. A prehistoric sound change in which sequences of *wu became mu changed the original animate accusative plural ending *-aw-us to -am-us. (For the vocative, see section 10).

The following paradigms illustrate forms of the u-stem adjectives āssu- 'good', and tēpu 'little'. Reconstructions are made on the basis of forms of similar adjectives that are attested.

 	 	anim	 	 	 	neut
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	āss-u-s, tēp-u-s	 	 	 	āss-u, tēp-u
acc.	 	āss-u-n, tēp-u-n	 	 	 	āss-u, tēp-u

gen.dat.	 	 	 	āss-aw-as, tēp-aw-as	 	 
abl.inst.	 	 	 	*ass-aw-az	 	 
8.2 Paradigms of u-stem nouns
In many u-stem nouns, the suffix was apparently originally -u- (prevocalic -w-) throughout the paradigm. Before endings beginning with vowels, it is often spelled -uw-. Some u-stem nouns attest both animate and neuter forms. A few u-stem nouns attest the archaic genitive plural in -an from Indo-European *-ōm, for example *hāss-uw-an as shown by the phonetic complement accompanying the the Sumerogram LUGAL-wa-an. This ending, however, was eventually replaced by -as. The following are paradigms for wappu- 'river bank', which is animate, and wēllu- 'meadow', which has animate and neuter forms:

 	 	anim	 	 
Singular	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	wēll-u-s	 	 
acc.	 	wapp-u-n, wēll-u-n	 	 
gen.	 	 	 	wapp-uw-as, wēll-uw-as
dloc	 	 	 	wapp-u-i, wēll-u-i
abl.	 	 	 	wapp-uw-az, wēll-uw-az
inst.	 	 	 	wēll-u-it
all.	 	 	 	wēll-uw-a
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	*wapp-uw-ēs	 	 
acc.	 	wapp-am-us	 	 
gen.dat.	 	 	 	wapp-uw-as, wēllu-uw-as
ab.inst.	 	 	 	 
The word for "knee" is especially interesting, since other IE languages preserve a neuter u-stem with an invariant root (in Indo-European terms, *gen-u-). Hittite, however, shows an alternation between a stem gēn-u- and forms with a stem kan-u- or gan-u- (pronounced with initial [g]) that probably reflect an Indo-European version of the root *gn-. The word for "knee" in Hittite also shows some forms with animate inflection, although cognates in the other Indo-European languages are neuter. Because knees come in pairs, and because singular and plural forms appear identical in several case forms, it is often impossible to tell whether one is dealing with a singular or plural form in the absence of other grammatical information (e.g., modifiers that are singular or plural). The word for "knee" also seems to have made an archaic endingless locative.

Paradigm of gēnu- (neut. and anim) 'knee'

 	 	neuter	 	 	 	animate
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	gēn-u

abl.inst.	 	 	 	gēnu-wa-az, gēnu-wa-za	 	 
8.3 Paradigms of au-stem nouns
A few nouns show a suffix -āu- in the nominative and accusative, and, at least originally, a suffix -u- (-w-) in the other cases. The suffix -āu- (-āw- before vowels), however, tended to spread throughout the paradigm. These nouns, which are the remnants of an archaic inflectional type, may be either animate or neuter. The following is a paradigm of singular forms of harnāu- (animate and neuter) 'birthstool', which, because a number of rituals designed to aid pregnancy and childbirth are preserved, is one of the best attested nouns of this type. Unambiguous forms of the plural do not, apparently, occur.

Paradigm of harnāu- 'birthstool'

Singular	 	anim	 	 	 	neut
nom.	 	harn-āu-s	 	 	 	harn-āu
acc.	 	harn-āu-n	 	 	 	harn-āu
gen.	 	 	 	harn-āw-as	 	 
dlocl	 	 	 	harn-u-i, harn-āw-i	 	 
The paradigms above represent a considerable simplification of the material found in the texts. We know, for example, that both nouns and adjectives were subject to analogical changes, for example the replacement of lengthening of the suffix vowel by the ending -a in the neuter plural, or the generalization of the suffix -āu- throughout the paradigms of nouns like harnāu-. Nominal and adjectival paradigms also influenced each other. In part, this was because some words could originally function either as nouns or adjectives, taking the appropriate inflection. For example, beside the adjective āssu- 'good' there is a corresponding neuter noun meaning "wares" (cf. English goods as a synonym for wares), and beside its antonym idālu- 'evil' there is a corresponding neuter noun idālu 'an evil'. One does find nominal forms in adjectival function and adjectival forms in nominal function; note, for example the accusative plural wapp-am-us 'river banks' with the adjectival suffix -am-.

9 Nominal sentences
Sentences in the present tense with a nominal or adjectival subjective complement may be made without a form of the verb "to be." The subjective complement is in the nominative case. In Hittite grammar, such sentences are traditionally called "nominal sentences," and in English they are translated with the appropriate form of the present of "be":

 	 	Labarnas	 	LUGAL-us	 	inarawanza
 	 	Labarna	 	the king	 	strong
 	 	"Labarna, the king, is strong."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ūk-wa	 	atti-mi	 	natta	 	āssus
 	 	I-quotative	 	to father-to my	 	not	 	dear
 	 	"I am not dear to my father."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	URUHattusi-ma-at	 	ŪL	 	āra
 	 	in Hattusas-but-it	 	not	 	right
 	 	"In Hattusas it is taboo."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ŪL	 	harātar
 	 	no	 	sin
 	 	"It is no sin."
The verb may not be left out if it is in the past tense or in the imperative. For example, we find a nominal sentence followed by a sentence with the third person singular imperative of the verb ēs- 'be', ēsdu in in the following passage:

 	 	mān-ma-as	 	ANA	 	DUTUŠI	 	kūrur	 	tugg-as
 	 	if-and-he	 	to	 	my majesty	 	enemy	 	to you-he
 	 	kūrur	 	ēsdu	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	enemy	 	let be	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"If he is an enemy to my majesty, let him (also) be an enemy to you."
10 Adjectives
Like English, Hittite has both attributive adjectives, adjectives that modify nouns, and predicative adjectives, adjectives in the predicates of sentences with "be" or similar verbs that establish a relationship of equality between the subject and predicate. Compare, for example, the English sentence "A strong king rules wisely," which uses the adjective "strong" as an attributive adjective, with the sentences "Mursilis was strong," and "The king became strong," which use "strong" as a predicative adjective. In Hittite, of course, adjectives are declined for case and number. An attributive adjective agrees in number and case with the noun it modifies. A predicative adjective is, like the subject of the sentence, in the nominative case, and it agrees with the subject in number.

10.1 Attributive adjectives
Attributive adjectives normally precede the nouns they modify.

nominative animate singular:

 	 	sallis	 	ārrunas
 	 	great	 	sea
 	 	"the great sea"
accusative animate singular:

 	 	āssun	 	halukan
 	 	good	 	message
 	 	"a good message"
nominative-accusative neuter:

 	 	idālu	 	paprātar
 	 	evil	 	impurity
 	 	"evil impurity"
dative-locative singular:

 	 	ekuni	 	IM-anti
 	 	cold	 	wind
 	 	"in the cold wind"
ablative singular:

 	 	dankuwaz	 	taknāz
 	 	dark	 	earth
 	 	"from the dark earth"
nominative plural animate:

 	 	āssawēs	 	EMEMEŠ
 	 	good	 	tongues
 	 	"good tongues"
accusative plural animate:

 	 	pargamus	 	HUR.SAG.MEŠ
 	 	high	 	mountains
 	 	"the high mountains"
nominative-accusative neuter:

 	 	harga	 	GIŠhahhal
 	 	bright	 	greenery
 	 	"bright greenery"
dative-locative plural:

 	 	pargauwas	 	auriyas
 	 	high	 	watch towers
 	 	"to the high watch towers"
10.2 Adjectives used as predicate nominatives.
In sentences with adjectives as predicate nominatives, the verb may be a form of "be," or it can be a verb such as kīs 'become' or āss- 'remain'. More commonly, the sentence may be a nominal sentence:

 	 	sumēll-a	 	ARADMEŠ	 	DINGIRLIM	 	meggaēs	 	eser
 	 	you-and	 	servants	 	gods	 	numerous	 	were
 	 	"And your servants of the gods were numerous."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	DUTU-us	 	DIM-as	 	mān	 	uktūres	 	 
 	 	the Sungod	 	The Stormgod	 	just as	 	eternal	 	 
 	 	LUGAL-us	 	MUNUS.LUGAL-ass-a	 	QĀTAMMA	 	uktūres	 	asantu
 	 	king	 	queen-and	 	likewise	 	eternal	 	let them be
 	 	"Just as the Sungod and the Stormgod are eternal, so likewise let the king and queen be eternal."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Labarnas	 	LUGAL-us	 	inarawanza
 	 	Labarna	 	king	 	strong
 	 	"Labarna, the king, is strong."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mān	 	hargaēs	 	mān	 	dankuwaēs
 	 	whether	 	white	 	whether	 	black
 	 	ŪL kuitki	 	duqqāri	 	 	 	 
 	 	no way	 	is important	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Whether (the rams) are white or (whether they are) black it doesn't matter in any way."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ANA	 	MHattusili-wa	 	MU.KAMHI.A	 	maninkuwantes
 	 	to	 	Hattusilis-quotative	 	years	 	short
 	 	"Hattusilis' years are short."
Lesson 3
Sara E. Kimball and Jonathan Slocum
The Telepenus of this text was a real Hittite king, unlike the Hattic god of the Telepenus myth from whom the king took his name. King Telepenus ruled toward the end of the Old Kingdom period (1525-1500 B.C.E.) and apparently composed this document as a way of providing a solution to the bloody chaos that prevailed in the royal family around the question of succession to the throne. The Hittite royal family (salli hassātar, literally 'great family') was composed not only of the king and his immediate family but also of numerous relatives who made up the kingdom's nobility. The nobility made up the king's advisory council, or pankus, the body Telepenus enjoins to warn off those who would harm members of the nobility. It would be comforting to think that they always acted nobly, but like modern people they often acted in their own, short-sighted interest, and they were keenly interested in the kingship. The Hittite king might have several wives, a primary wife, wives of the "second rank" (or tān pēdas), and, in addition, a number of recognized mistresses. Such a family structure had the potential to create a volatile situation, since the king's wives and mistresses would inevitably bear him sons who, as they grew to manhood, might harbor royal ambitions, and as the history of the Hittite monarchy attests might act ruthlessly in their pursuit of power.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The text itself, which is preserved in a number of copies in Neo-Hittite writing, including a version in Akkadian, begins with an account of Hittite dynastic history from the reign of the first Hittite king, Labarna I, and covers events through the reign of Telepenus himself. In it, history is used skillfully to support the argument that rules for the succession need to be codified. The text begins by claiming that in the reigns of the earlier kings the royal family, the people, and the army were united, and the Hittite kingdom prospered and was victorious in battle. It then goes on to account various assassinations of Hittite kings and palace intrigues that, according to Telepenus, provoked divine disfavor and left the kingdom weak and vulnerable to its enemies. Telepenus himself was involved in such intrigues. He and his wife, the sister of the Hittite king, Huzziyas, were targets of an assassination plot which Telepenus attributes to his brother-in-law, and later both Telepenus' wife, Isparariyas, the queen, and his son Ammunas were apparently murdered. Interestingly, although Telepenus apparently deposed Huzziyas and exiled his brothers to the country, he describes his own ascension to the throne with the formulaic phrase "when I seated myself on the throne of my father."

The extracts provided below give Telepenus' account of his ascension to the kingship and his codification of the rules of succession. The former gives a flavor of the internal violence of the Old Kingdom, while the latter provides the conclusions Telepenus drew from that bloody history. The institution of the L/Uantiyant- (from anda 'in(to)' plus tiyant-, participle of tiya- 'step', literally 'the man who steps in') involved the adoption of a son-in-law as heir to the family fortune. It is described in the Hittite law code as recourse for common folk who had no sons, and similar institutions are attested in other ancient and modern societies. No doubt Telepenus, an in-law himself, regarded this custom with a certain amount of self interest. It would be reassuring to think that Telepenus' rules for the royal succession were followed by subsequent generations, but later Hittite historical texts suggest that Telepenus' rules were often disregarded.

Translation
And Huzziyas became king. And Telepenus had Istapariyas, his eldest sister, as wife. Huzziyas would have killed them, but the plan became known, and Telepenus drove them (the assassins) off. He (Huzziyas) had five brothers. (Telepenus) constructed houses for them, (saying) "Let them go and remain (there); let them eat and drink, and do no harm to them." And I (Telepenus) say: "They harmed me, but I will not harm them." When I, Telepenus, seated myself upon the throne of my father, I went on a military campaign to Hassuwas and destroyed the city of Hassuwas. My army was also in Zizzilippas, and in Zizzilippas a battle occurred.
And now bloodshed became common even among the royal family itself. Istapariya, the queen, died. And afterwards it happened that Ammunas, the prince, died. And the 'men of the god' are saying: "Look, in Hattusas, bloodshed has become common." Then I, Telepenus, summoned the council in Hattusas, (saying): "From now on, in Hattusas, let no one do evil to a son of the royal family (or) use a dagger against him. A son of the first rank, a prince, only should become king. If there is no first-ranked prince, (then) let one who is of the second rank become king. If there is no royal male heir, let them take an antiyant-man for a first-ranked daughter, and let him become king. In the future, whoever becomes king after me, let his brothers, his sons, his relatives by marriage, the men of his family, and his army be united. Then you shall come with your strong arm and conquer the enemy's lands. And don't say the following: 'I will issue pardons.' You pardon nothing; you even order arrests! Do not kill anyone among the (royal) family. That is not good. Moreover, he who becomes king and seeks evil against brother (or) sister-you, are his advisory council. Tell him frankly: 'Study this story of bloodshed from the tablet. Previously bloodshed became common in Hattusas and the gods have placed it for you on the royal family.'"
Grammar
11 Enclitics
In Hittite a number of forms corresponding to grammatical function words appear as enclitics. An enclitic is a word with no independent stress of its own that is attached to a preceding word with which it forms a single accentual unit. A comparable example from English would be the reduced form of "not," "n't," used in negative contractions (e.g., "didn't" or "shouldn't"). We will look at specific uses of enclitics in more detail in later sections; these are a few basics.

Special forms of the personal and possessive pronouns and certain conjunctions are enclitic. The particle -wa- (-war- before vowels), which signals that a sentence is quoted speech, the particle -za- (called a reflexive particle, which modifies both nouns and verbs), the so-called locational particles (-kkan, -ssan, -asta, and -apa, which also affect the meanings of verbs) and the so- called emphasizing particle -pat are also enclitics.

The enclitics (except for the emphasizing particle -pat, which modifies individual words), and the conjunctions when they connect elements within the sentence, are attached to the first fully stressed word of a sentence or clause; for example:

 	 	DTelepenus-a	 	arha	 	iyannis
 	 	Telepenus-but	 	away	 	stomped
 	 	"But Telepenus stomped away."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	pēdi-iss-ma	 	LÚ.U19.LU-an	 	pāi
 	 	In-place-his-but	 	a person	 	he gives
 	 	"But in his place, he gives a man."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ug-a-war-us	 	HUL	 	ŪL	 	iyami
 	 	I-but-quotative particle-them	 	harm	 	not	 	will do
 	 	"But I will not do them harm."
The Akkadian prepositions ANA 'on', INA 'in', 'into', and ŠA 'of', since they were merely markers of grammatical relations and not parts of the Hittite sentence, do not count as the sentence's first word:

 	 	INA	 	GUNNI-ma	 	kalmīsanis	 	wisūriyantati
 	 	In	 	the hearth-and	 	the logs	 	were stifled
 	 	"And in the hearth, the logs were stifled."
When a Sumerogram or Akkadogram stands for a Hittite word, however, the Hittite word is part of the sentence, and enclitics may be attached to it:

 	 	UDU-us-za	 	SILA4-ZU	 	mimmas
 	 	The ewe-reflexive particle	 	her lamb	 	rejected
 	 	"The ewe rejected her lamb."
11.1 Sentence particles and enclitics
Often, the enclitics are attached to a sentence particle. This may be nu, which is found in texts from all periods, or su or ta, which only occur in early texts and copies of early texts. The sentence particles may themselves indicate relationships between clauses, and are sometimes to be translated as "and," "but," or "then," although nu in particular sometimes functions as a semantically empty word that serves as a prop for enclitics.

 	 	nu-wa-za	 	azzikkandu
 	 	nu-quotative particle-reflexive particle	 	let (them) eat
 	 	"Let them eat (for themselves)."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-ssi	 	hatrānuun
 	 	nu-to him	 	I wrote
 	 	"I wrote to him."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-wa-mu-za	 	tepnusket
 	 	nu-quotative particle-me-reflexive particle	 	he has belittled
 	 	"He has belittled me."
When the enclitic begins in a vowel, the sentence particle loses its final vowel:

 	 	n-at	 	DUMU	 	NAM.LÚ.U19.LU-as istmasdu
 	 	nu-it	 	mankind	 	let them hear
 	 	"And let mankind hear it."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at-san	 	wappui	 	dāi
 	 	nu-it-locatival particle "over"	 	on the river bank	 	she places
 	 	"And she places it on the river bank."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	s-an	 	dālahhun
 	 	su-it	 	I abandoned
 	 	I abandoned it (the city).	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	t-an	 	istarnikzi
 	 	ta-him	 	makes sick
 	 	"...makes him sick."
12 Personal Pronouns
Hittite has two types of personal pronoun. One is a series of pronouns that function as independent words with their own accents (tonic pronouns), while the other series consists of pronouns that have no independent accent of their own but are instead, enclitic. The pronouns of the first and second persons are descended from Indo-European pronominal precursors, but in the third person the demonstrative pronoun apā-, "that (one)" generally serves also as a personal pronoun. A few forms from a stem siyē-, which is probably to be derived from a demonstrative stem, are also found in pronominal function in early texts. The following is a paradigm of the earliest forms of the first and second person tonic pronouns:

Tonic pronouns, first and second persons

 	 	1 sg.	 	1 pl.	 	2 sg.	 	2 pl.
 	 	"I, me"	 	"we, us"	 	"you"	 	"you"
nom.	 	u:k	 	we:s	 	zik	 	sume:s
acc.	 	ammuk	 	anza:s	 	tuk	 	suma:s
gen.	 	amme:l	 	anze:l	 	tue:l	 	sume:l
dloc	 	ammuk	 	anza:s	 	tuk	 	sume:s
abl	 	amme:daz	 	anze:daz	 	tue:daz	 	sume:daz
This system shows a number of analogical changes over the five hundred years during which the Hittite texts were attested. The original first person singular nominative ūk was eventually replaced by ammuk, the original accusative and dative-locative. The first person plural nominative wēs is archaic and was replaced by anzās, the original accusative. The original second person plural nominative sumēs was partially replaced by sumās from the accusative and dative-locative. In Neo-Hittite texts, the opposite development, replacement of the original accusative sumās by the nominative sumēs, is also sporadically attested. For the second person plural genitive, an archaic form, sumenzan, is found in early texts. Its replacement, sumēl, was modeled after the genitive in -:el of other personal and demonstrative pronouns.

The following forms from the stem siye- are found. Although the complete paradigm is not attested, forms that occur include an endingless locative distinct from the dative-locative.

Forms of third person siyē-

gen.	 	siy:el
dloc.	 	syēdani
loc	 	syēt
abl	 	siyēz
The tonic pronouns and apā- are occasionally strenghened with the suffix -ila or -il, giving them a meaning something like that of the emphatic use of English reflexive pronouns in sentences like She, herself, doesn't agree; for example:

 	 	nasma-at	 	zik-ma	 	zikila	 	istamasti
 	 	Moreover-it	 	you-but	 	you, yourself	 	hear
 	 	"Moreover, if you--you yourself--hear it (something against the Hittite king)..."
Although the tonic pronouns are used for emphasis, for clarification of pronominal reference, and the second person is used for direct address, enclitic pronouns are more frequent, and two enclitic pronouns may occur within a single sentence. There are two sets of enclitic pronouns. One set functions as datives or accusatives in the first and second persons and as datives only in the third person. This set is clearly related to the corresponding tonic pronouns:

Dative and accusative pronouns

 	 	Singular	 	Plural
1.	 	-mu	 	-nnas
2.	 	-tta, -ttu	 	-smas
3.	 	-ssi	 	-smas
Consonants are only be doubled after vowels in the cuneiform syllabary. Further, because of the limitations of the cuneiform syllabary, second and third person pronouns have to be spelled with a "dead" vowel, normally as -su-ma-as The second person singular pronoun shows up as -ttu (-ddu) before the reflexive particle -za and as -tta, -dda in other environments.

The second set of pronouns is third person only. These pronouns, which have an alternating stem in early texts, function as nominatives and accusatives and are marked for gender:

Third person pronouns

 	 	Singular	 	Plural
Nominative Animate	 	-as	 	-at
Accusative Animate	 	-an	 	-us
Nominative-Accusative Plural	 	-at	 	-e
The plural forms of this set of pronouns underwent analogical change. After the earliest period, the third person plural nominative animate -e and nominative- accusative neuter were replaced by -at, the original form of the nominative- accusative neuter singular and the accusative animate plural was sporadically replaced by -as.

13 The Middle Voice
Verbs taking middle inflection may be stative, passive, medio-passive, or transitive. For more on the use of the middle see Grammar Point 11. The middle shows two sets of synchronically unrelated endings in the third person singular present and imperative, and attested paradigms may represent a blend of conjugations that were originally distinct in Indo-European, though a number of Hittite verbs may take both sets of endings. Traditionally, the third person singular present endings -a and -ari and the third person singular imperative ending -aru, have been termed "hi-conjugation," while the fuller set has been termed "mi-conjugation." There is, however, no hard and fast correlation between these endings and active mi- and hi-conjugation forms. One view regards the "hi-conjugation" endings (called here "middle two") as reflecting an Indo-European stative conjugation; that is a special set of endings for verbs that express states of affairs.

In Hittite, however, these endings occur with verbs that are not stative as well as with statives. By contrast, the "mi-conjugation" middle (or middle one), is characterized by variation in the form of the endings. The r-less endings of the present singular resemble the endings of the hi-conjugation, prompting some scholars to argue for various theories connecting the two in early Indo-European. The endings with -r- of the middle present have parallels in Italic, Celtic, and Tocharian. The middle preterit is characterized by endings with a dental stop, which was apparently voiced, since it was written as a single stop between vowels (e.g., first person singular preterit -VH-HA-TI = [-hhadi]). In the third person of the preterit, the final -i is original. It spread, however, to the first and second persons, while new third person singular and plural forms lacking the -i were, conversely, created on the model of the earlier first and second person endings. The reduplicated first person singular endings, present -hhahari, preterit -hhahhati, and imperative -hhaharu are found in Neo-Hittite texts.

13.2 Middle Paradigms
The following are paradigms of several verbs that are well attested in the middle. The verbs kīs- 'become', and ar- 'stay', take only middle endings. Kīs- and ar- take the middle two endings -a, -ari and -aru, as well as the middle one endings.

14 Uses of the Middle
Some verbs, deponents, are inflected only in the middle. Deponents are normally intransitive, (e.g., ki- 'lie', kīs- 'become, happen, turn out', iya- 'go', ēs- 'sit', or ar- 'stay'). Some deponents may act as suppletive medio-passive correspondents of normally active verbs (e.g., ki- 'lie' beside dāi- 'put, place'; kuēn- 'kill' beside akk- 'die'; or kīs- 'become, turn out, happen' beside the active mi-verb iya- 'do, make'); for example:

 	 	ANA	 	TUPPI RIKALTI	 	ŠA ABI-YA-kan	 	kuyēs	 	URUDIDLI.HI.A	 	ŪL	 	kiyantari
 	 	On	 	treaty tablet-his	 	of-my-father	 	that	 	cities	 	not	 	set down
 	 	"The cities that are not set down on my father's treaty tablet..."
Compare the active dāi- 'put', meaning "set down" or "establish" (on a treaty tablet):

 	 	ZAGMEŠ-is-si	 	mahhan	 	dais
 	 	Boarders-for-him	 	how	 	he set down
The Hittite middle may be stative, for example:

 	 	n-as	 	arha	 	kitta
 	 	And-it	 	apart	 	lies
 	 	"It lies apart."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	MU	 	2.KAM	 	hameshanza	 	SIG5-atta
 	 	(For)	 	two years	 	spring	 	is good
 	 	"For two years, the spring will be good."
The middle may have a sense akin to that of the Greek middle, indicating that the action in some way affects the subject: for example:

 	 	DUTU-as	 	karpiyatta
 	 	Sungod	 	is angry
 	 	"The Sungod is angry."
The middle may also indicate that the subject undergoes a change of state; for example:

 	 	LÚ-as	 	witti	 	meyanni	 	armiyatta	 	n-as	 	SIG5-atta
 	 	The man	 	every	 	year	 	will become sick	 	and-he	 	will recover
 	 	"The man will become sick every year and will recover."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	DUMU	 	miyari
 	 	And	 	a son	 	is born
 	 	"And a son is born."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mahahan-ma-za	 	ABU-YA	 	kuwa-pi	 	DINGIRLIM	 	kisat
 	 	"But when my father became a god (i.e. 'died and was deified')..."
 	 	nu	 	uttar	 	isduwāti
 	 	and	 	plot	 	became known
 	 	"The plot became known."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	sallas-pat	 	hassanas	 	ēshar	 	pangariyattati
 	 	But	 	among great-even	 	family	 	bloodshed	 	has become common
 	 	"But now, bloodshed has become common even among the royal family."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuita	 	imma	 	mieshati
 	 	Even	 	when	 	I grew up
 	 	"Even when I grew up..."
The middle is also used to make sentences akin to the English passive in which the patient (the noun that would be the direct object of a corresponding active sentence) appears in the nominative, for example:

 	 	INA	 	GUNNI-ma	 	kalmīsanis	 	wisūriyantati
 	 	In	 	the-hearth-but	 	logs	 	were stifled
 	 	"In the hearth, the logs were stifled."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	EZEN4	 	DSIN	 	EZEN4	 	tēthuwas-a
 	 	And	 	the festival	 	of the moon	 	(and) the festival	 	of thunder
 	 	anda imiyattati	 	n-at	 	taksan	 	kisantari	 	 
 	 	are mingled	 	and-they	 	together	 	take place	 	 
 	 	"The festival of the moon and the festival of thunder are mingled, and they take place jointly."
Compare with the active:

 	 	nu	 	kī	 	hūman	 	ANA	 	ZÍD.DA ŠE	 	isni	 	menahhanda	 	immiyami
 	 	and	 	this	 	all	 	with	 	barley meal	 	into dough	 	against	 	I mix
 	 	"All this I mix with barley meal into dough."
When the passive has an agent (the noun that would be the subject in a corresponding active sentence), the agent takes the dative case:

 	 	DUTU-i-kan	 	kuis	 	āssiyattari
 	 	By-the-Sungod	 	who	 	is loved
 	 	"...who is loved by the Sungod."
The middles of some verbs may be transitive, for example:

 	 	nu-mu	 	pahhasta
 	 	And-me	 	he protected
 	 	"He protected me."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	1	 	NINDA	 	SIG	 	wappuwaas	 	DMAH	 	parsiya
 	 	One	 	thin-bread	 	of the river bank	 	for the goddess	 	I crumble	 	 
 	 	"She crumbles one thin loaf for the mother-goddess of the river bank."
15 The Genitive
The genitive is the case of possession. Nouns in the genitive normally occur before the heads of the noun phrases they modify, but they may occur after the head, especially if the head is a Sumerogram or Akkaodogram:

 	 	namma	 	wappuwas	 	IM-an	 	dāi
 	 	moreover	 	of the river bank (gen.)	 	clay	 	she takes
 	 	"Moreover, she takes clay of the riverbank."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at	 	sakuniyas	 	purut	 	dāi
 	 	And-it	 	of-the-spring (gen.)	 	mud	 	she takes
 	 	"She takes it, the mud of the spring..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	dankuwayas-at	 	taknas	 	KASKAL-an	 	paiddu
 	 	dark (gen.)-it	 	of earth (gen.)	 	the road	 	let travel
 	 	"Let it travel the road of the dark earth."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-us	 	arunas	 	erhus	 	yēt
 	 	And-them	 	of-the-sea (gen.)	 	borders	 	he made
 	 	"And he made them borders of the sea."
Genitives are especially apt to occur after the head of the noun phrase when the head is written ideographically, but this placement is not obligatory:

 	 	takku	 	ANŠE.KU.RA	 	tūriyauwas	 	...	 	hālias	 	harapta
 	 	if	 	donkey	 	of harnessing (gen.)	 	...	 	to folds	 	strays
 	 	"If a donkey of harnassing (i.e. 'a trained donkey') ... strays to the folds..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	EZEN	 	hameshandas-ma	 	ŪL	 	DÙ-anza
 	 	festival	 	of spring (gen.)-but	 	not	 	(was) celebrated
 	 	"But the festival of spring had not been celebrated."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takkuw-as	 	attas-sas-a	 	É-ri	 	aki
 	 	If-she	 	her-father's (gen.)-but	 	in house	 	dies
 	 	"But if she dies in her father's house..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	LÚEL-LAM	 	MUŠ-an	 	kuenzi	 	tamell-a	 	ŠUM-an	 	tezzi
 	 	if	 	free man	 	snake	 	kills	 	and-another's (gen.)	 	name	 	says
 	 	"If a free man kills a snake and pronounces another's name..."
In archaic texts, an enclitic possessive pronoun may redundantly accompany a noun or pronoun in the genitive:

 	 	attas-ttas-wa	 	SAG.DU-set	 	waggariya
 	 	father's (gen.)-of your (gen.)-quotative	 	head-his	 	revolt
 	 	"Revolt against your father, his head! (i.e. Revolt against your father's person!)"
15.1 Use of Akkadian to indicate possession
The Akkadian preposition ŠA is often used to indicate that a following noun is the genitive, especially with Sumerograms or Akkadograms. Proper names and place names in Hittite are normally uninflected following ŠA. Presumably the Hittite words that the Sumerograms and Akkadograms stood for were inflected as genitives when pronounced.

 	 	ŠA	 	MUuhha-LÚ-ya	 	URUApāsan	 	URU-an	 	GUL-ahta
 	 	of	 	Uhhaziti-and	 	Apasa	 	city	 	it struck
 	 	And it struck Uhhaziti's city, Apasa."	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ŠA	 	DIŠTAR	 	parā handandatar	 	memahhi
 	 	of	 	Ishtar	 	divine power	 	I will tell
 	 	"I will tell of Ishtar's divine power."
Akkadian enclitic possessive pronouns are often attached to Sumerograms or Akkadograms to indicate possessiion. In the sentence below, the Akkadian first person enclitic possessive -YA is attached to the Akkadogram meaning "father."

 	 	À.BU-YA-nnas-za	 	MMursiliis	 	4	 	DUMUMEŠ	 	...	 	hasta
 	 	father-my-us-reflexive	 	Mursilis	 	four	 	children	 	...	 	fathered
 	 	"My father, Mursilis, fathered us four children..."
The Akkadian possessive pronoun may be used redundantly alongside a noun in the genitive or a tonic (accented) personal pronoun in the genitive:

 	 	nu	 	GIŠkalmisanan	 	ammel	 	KARAŠHI.A-YA	 	usket
 	 	and	 	thunderbolt	 	my (gen.)	 	army-my	 	saw
 	 	"And my army saw the thunderbolt."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	LUGAL-was	 	ŠUM-ŠU	 	āssu	 	memisketten
 	 	and	 	king's (gen.)	 	name-his	 	well	 	speak
 	 	"And speak well of the king's name!"
15.2 Partitive apposition
Possession may also be indicated by so-called partitive apposition. In such constructions, composed of two nouns in the same case, the first noun is the equivalent in meaning to a genitive. For example, this phrase from the Law Code has two nouns in the accusative, A.ŠÀ-an 'field' and ZAG-an 'boundary', which are literally to be translated as "a field (its) boundary." A later copy of the Law Code replaces the first accusative by the genitive A.ŠÀ-as:

 	 	takku	 	A.ŠÀ-an	 	ZAG-an	 	kuiski	 	parsiya
 	 	if	 	field	 	border	 	someone	 	breaks
 	 	"If someone breaks the border of a field..."
In the following sentence the two nouns in partitive apposition, aruni 'sea' and ZAG-si 'shore', are in the dative-locative:

 	 	URULulluwayas-san	 	KUR-e	 	aruni	 	ZAG-si	 	ēszi
 	 	Lulluwayas-locatival	 	country	 	at the sea	 	at its shore	 	is
 	 	"The country Luluwaya is at the shore of the sea."
15.3 Predicative genitives
The genitives of the stressed personal pronouns are used as predicates to express possession. They may be used with forms of the verb "to be" or in nominal sentences:

 	 	nu-war-at	 	ammel	 	asanzi
 	 	and-quotative-they	 	of me	 	are
 	 	"They are mine."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	KÚR	 	URUAlasiya-wa	 	ammel
 	 	land	 	Alasiya-quotative	 	of me
 	 	"The land of Alasiya is mine!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	asi-man-wa	 	URU-as	 	ammel	 	kisari
 	 	that-irrealis-quotative	 	city	 	mine	 	becomes
 	 	"I wish that city were mine."
Genitives can also be used as quasi-adjectives in the predicates of sentences; for example, huiswannas, genitive of the verbal abstract huiswātar 'life' (spelled with the Sumerogram TI) is used in the following from the Apology of Hattusilis III:

 	 	ŪL-war-as	 	TI-annas
 	 	neg.-quotative-he	 	of life
 	 	"He is not of life (i.e. He will not live)."
15.4 Genitive of material
The genitive may be used to indicate the material out of which something is made or composed:

 	 	nu	 	isnas	 	pūrpuran	 	iyanzi
 	 	and	 	of dough (gen.)	 	a lump	 	they make
 	 	"They make a lump of dough."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	UR.TUR.RA	 	appuzziyas	 	ienzi
 	 	and	 	dog-small	 	of tallow (gen.)	 	they make
 	 	"They make a small dog of tallow."
15.5 Partitive genitive
Like Greek and Latin, Hittite has a partitive genitive. That is, the genitive expresses the idea that something is a part of a larger whole:

 	 	humandas-pat	 	EGIR-izzis	 	DUMU-as	 	esun
 	 	of all-very	 	last	 	of the children	 	I was
 	 	"I was the very last (i.e. the youngest) of all the children."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	NIM.LÀL	 	teriyas	 	UD-as	 	miuwas	 	UD-as
 	 	bees	 	of three (gen.)	 	of days (gen.)	 	of four (gen.)	 	of days (gen.)
 	 	KASKAL-an	 	pāndu	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	journey	 	let them go	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Let the bees go on a journey of three days, of four days!"
15.6 Nominal genitives
Genitive forms may be used nominally. For example, the genitive of tayazzil 'theft', tayazzilas, can be used in the sense "person of theft" (LÚtayazzilas), in other words, "thief." Such nouns formed from genitives may come to be fully inflected. We find, for example, LÚkurura- 'enemy' from LÚkururas 'man of war', genitive of kūur 'war', LÚtaksula- 'friend, ally' from LÚtaksulas, genitive of taksul 'alliance, peace', and LÚwastula- 'sinner' from wastulas genitive of wastul 'sin, fault'.

Lesson 4
Sara E. Kimball, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
The collection of Hittite legal texts is generally referred to as The Laws, suggesting that it does not make up a document produced by a central authority but rather it is a compilation of civil and criminal law traditionally observed by society, as illustrated by the excerpts given here from among somewhat over two hundred clauses. The earliest record of it dates to the Old Kingdom, about 1650 B.C., but that refers to still earlier versions. Many copies have survived, four from the Old Kingdom alone; these maintain the collection with little or no change. As a general characteristic, the provisions require cooperation rather than vengeance or imprisonment for offenses. Like the initial clauses given here, some deal with criminal offenses such as abduction, theft, homicide and so on. Others deal with civil offenses related to marriage, management of livestock, and various services. Further knowledge of the practice of law in Hittite society is provided by texts on court proceedings and statements by the king or other administrators, but the basic information on legal practice of the Hittites is given in The Laws.

Reading and Textual Analysis
All 10 clauses given here are included in the collection catalogued as "KBo VI," mostly KBo VI 3. The first three clauses (1, 2, 5) deal with criminal offenses; they illustrate nicely the identification of specific offenses and the resultant punishment. The third is especially notable in specifying different punishments according to the type and place of offense. In all three, the sentence translated "he shall look to his house for it" has been the subject of great attention and a variety of interpretations. By what is probably the best interpretation, it indicates that the estate of the person performing a criminal action will be involved in any penalty.

The fourth and fifth clauses (9, 10) deal with less serious offenses; among other things, they illustrate that legal practice has undergone change from former times.

The sixth and seventh clauses (28, 37) deal with civil offenses and are self-explanatory. But if, as in the seventh (37, from KBo VI 2 with a near-duplicate in KBo VI 3), a criminal offense occurs in the attempt at solution, the perpetrator is outlawed as a wolf and subject to the usual punishments for such a criminal offense.

The last three clauses (66, 86, 55) also deal with civil offenses, and illustrate the extent to which the laws deal with minor infractions. Yet the last, 55 (from KBo VI 13 and 26), seems to lead to a remarkably serious punishment. It is explained in accordance with a widespread belief associating a snake with a specific person, and making it clear when killing the snake that a similar action is to strike its surrogate.

Translation
1 If someone kills a man or a woman in a quarrel, he (the killer) produces the body (lit. 'that one') and gives (in recompense) four people (lit. 'heads') -- whether (he kills) a man or a woman -- he shall look to his house for it.
2 If someone kills a male slave or a female slave in a quarrel, he (the killer) produces the body (lit. 'that one') and gives (in recompense) four people (lit. 'heads') -- whether (he kills) a man or a woman -- he shall look to his house for it.
5 If someone kills a Hittite merchant, he shall give one hundred mina of silver. He shall look to his house for it. If (the killing occurs) in the land of Luwiya or in the land of Pala, the shall pay one hundred mina of silver and restore his goods. If (the killing occurs) in the land of Hatti, he shall also produce the merchant himself (for burial).
9 If someone injures a person's head, they used to give 6 shekels of silver: the injured person took three shekels of silver, and they used to take three shekels of silver for the palace. But now, the king has waived the palace share, so that the injured person alone takes three shekels of silver.
10 If someone injures a person and makes him ill, he performs sick maintenance for him. In his place, he provides a person to work his estate while he recovers. When he recovers, (the assailant) will give him six shekels of silver, and he will also pay the doctor's fee himself.
28 If a daughter (is) promised to a man, and another (man) abducts her and steals the bride price, the one who abducts her, gives the first man whatever he paid (as bride-price) and he makes restitution to him. The (woman's) father and mother do not make restitution (to the original prospective son-in-law). If the father and mother give her to another man, then the father and mother do make restitution (to the original prospective son-in-law). If the mother and father refuse (to make restitution), they shall separate her from him (the second man).
37 If someone abducts a woman and a (group of) helper(s) goes after them, if two or three men are killed, there is no restitution: 'You (sg.) have become a wolf.'
66 If a plow ox, a draft horse, if a heifer, (or) a mare wanders into (another owner's) corral; if a tame? he-goat, if a ewe, if a ram strays into (another owner's) fold, and its owner finds it, he shall take it back by right. He (the animal's owner) shall not seize him (the corral or fold's owner) (as) a thief.
86 If a pig goes into a grain-heap, a field, (or) a garden, and the owner of the grain-heap, field, (or) garden strikes it and it dies, he shall give it back to its owner. But if he does not give it (back), he shall become a thief.
55 If a free man kills a snake and speaks another's name (while killing it), he shall pay forty shekels of silver. If he (the offender) is a slave, however, he himself shall die (i.e. 'be executed').
Grammar
16 Demonstrative Pronouns
Hittite has two widely attested demonstrative pronouns: one that indicates that what it refers to is nearby, corresponding to English "this," and another that indicates that the referent is more distant, corresponding to English "that." As with the tonic personal pronouns, and the relative and interrogative pronouns, the demonstratives have a set of pronominal endings distinct from nominal endings.

The demonstrative kā- 'this (one)' has a stem that alternates between kā-, k-, kī- and kē-. In early texts, the the nominative-accusative neuter singular kī- is kept distinct from the nominative-accusative neuter plural and nominative plural animate kē. In later texts, however, one finds kē functioning as a nominative-accusative singular neuter and kī functioning as a nominative plural animate and nominative-accusative plural neuter. The instrumental occurs in three forms, one with the pronominal ending -anda, one with the ending -t that occurs with both nouns and pronouns, and another with the ending -anna. In the genitive plural, the original ending -enzan was eventually replaced by the -l of the singular.

dat/loc.	 	kītas, kēdas	 	 	 	 
The demonstrative apā- 'that (one)' is also used as a third person pronoun. Its archaic genitive plural apēnzan was replaced by apēdas with the nominal genitive plural ending.

 	 	anim.	 	 	 	neut.

dat/loc.	 	 	 	apēdas	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	apēdaz	 	 
As noted above, kā- is used to refer to people or objects considered relatively near, while apā- refers to people or objects considered relatively distant. When used as a third person pronoun, apā- literally means 'that one'.

 	 	"If someone kills a man or a woman as the result of a quarrel, (the murderer) brings (back) that one (the body)."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	LÚ.U19.LU-an	 	kuiski	 	húnikzi	 	 
 	 	if	 	person	 	someone	 	injures	 	 
 	 	t-an	 	istarnikzi	 	nu	 	apūn	 	sāktāizzi
 	 	and-him	 	makes sick	 	and	 	that one	 	he takes care of
 	 	"If someone injures a person and makes him sick, (the offender) takes care of that one (the injured party)."
Adverbs, many of which describe spatial or temporal relations are formed from the case forms or stems of both demonstratives. For example: kāni 'here', kēt 'on this side', kitpandalaz 'from now on', or kisssan 'in this way, thus' are from kā-, while, for example, apēda 'there', apiya 'there, then', apiyakku 'even there', and apēnissan 'thus' are from apā-, apē-. Since apā- may be used as a third person pronoun, it can take the reflexive suffix -ila, making the reflexive pronoun apāsila 'himself, herself, itself'.

The word kāsa, which is used to begin sentences, is conventially translated "look!, lo!" or "behold," and is found beside a kāsma of similar function is also from the stem of kā-. Its force was perhaps originally to draw the listner's attention to an utterance, and it is perhaps more literally translatable as "here, then!":

Beside the demonstratives kā- and apā- Hittite has a third set of pronouns from a stem tamai-, tama-, tame- 'other, another'. The animate accusative plural is found only in the Empire period, a time during which the original accusative plural animate ending -us could be used for the nominative plural in pronouns and nouns.

 	 	anim.	 	 	 	neut.
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	tamāis	 	 	 	tamai
acc.	 	tamāin	 	 	 	 
gen.	 	 	 	tamēl, tame:das	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	tammatta, damēdani	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	tamēdaz	 	 
inst.	 	 	 	 	 	 
all.	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	damaus	 	 	 	tamāi
acc.	 	damaus	 	 	 	tamāi
dat/loc.	 	tamēdas	 	 	 	 
The following sentence from the "Law Code" provides an example of tamāi- in the genitive:

 	 	takku	 	LÚEL-LAM	 	MUŠ-an	 	kuenzi	 	tamell-a	 	ŠUM-an	 	tezzi
 	 	if	 	free man	 	snake	 	kills	 	and-another's (gen.)	 	name	 	says
 	 	"If a free man kills a snake and pronounces another's name..."
17 The Enclitic String
Sentences with more than one enclitic are quite common, and the enclitic function words in such sentences appear in a rigid order after the word or sentence connective to which they are attached.

Such combinations of enclitics can be though of as strings composed of locations, or "slots" that can be occupied by specific enclitic particles. The full enclitic string has five slots and can be represented as follows:

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	conjunctions	 	quotative	 	personal pronouns	 	reflexive	 	locational
 	 	-a 'but', -ma	 	-war-, -wa-	 	 	 	-za-	 	-kkan, -ssan
 	 	-a, -ya 'and'	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-asta, -apa
Enclitic strings with each slot filled are rare, but strings with three enclitics are not uncommon and strings with four enclitics are not unknown. When the second-person singular dative-accusative pronoun -tta, the third person singular dative -ssi, and the first person plural dative-accusative -nnas- precede enclitics beginning with vowels, their initial consonants are often doubled. Similarly, when the locatival particles -ssan and -kkan, which always end the enclitic string, are preceded by enclitics ending in vowels, their initial consonants are often doubled.

17.1 Enclitic combinations
The following examples illustrate some of the possible combinations of enclitics:

ug-a-war-us

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	-a 'but'	 	-war-	 	-us	 	 	 	-kan
GUD-ya-wa-mu

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	-ya 'and, but'	 	-wa-	 	-mu	 	 	 	-kan
zik-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-kan
mahhan-ma-za-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	-ma-	 	 	 	 	 	-za-	 	-kan
nu-wa-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4
 	 	 	 	-wa-	 	 	 	 	 	-kan
nu-tta-kkan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	-tta-	 	 	 	-kkan
nu-za-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	-za-	 	-kan
nu-mu-za

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	-mu	 	-za	 	 
nu-wa-mu-za

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	-wa-	 	-mu-	 	-za-	 	 
nu-war-at-san

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	-war-	 	-at-	 	 	 	-san
n-an-za-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	-an-	 	-za-	 	-kan
17.2 Before -za
When the second person singular dative-accusative pronoun -tta- precedes the reflexive particle -za, it shows up as -tu-, -ddu-. For example:

nu-wa-du-za

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	-wa-	 	-du-	 	-za-	 	 
17.3 Pronoun slot
More than one enclitic pronoun may occur in slot three, the pronoun slot, for example:

n-an-si-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	-an- 2 sg. acc.anim.	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	-si- 3 sg. dat.	 	 	 	-kan
nu-war-an-mu

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	-an- 2 sg. acc.anim.	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	-war-	 	-mu- 1 sg. dat.	 	 	 	 
n-as-mu-kan

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 5
 	 	 	 	 	 	3 sg. nom.anim.	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	-mu- 1 sg. acc.	 	 	 	-kan
n-at-mu

 	 	Slot 1	 	Slot 2	 	Slot 3	 	Slot 4	 	Slot 4
 	 	 	 	 	 	3 sg. acc.anim.	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	-mu- 1 sg. dat.	 	 	 	 
There are, however, restrictions on the case forms that may occur together in the pronoun slot. In a string with two personal pronouns, a third person pronoun generally precedes other pronouns, for example, nu-war-an-mu and n-at-mu with third person singular animate -an- and third person singular -at followed by first person singular -mu in dative function are possible, but strings such as *nu-mu-an and *nu-mu-at with the third person pronouns -an- and third person singular -at coming after the dative -mu- would not be expected.

Two dative pronouns may not co-occur. Therefore, if two pronouns with dative-accusative function do occur in an enclitic string, the first is to be interpreted as an accusative and the second as a dative, e.g. nu-tta-mu with dative-accusative -tta- and -mu- should be understood as 'and you to me'; nu-smas-mu with dative-accusative -smas- and dative-accusative -mu- is understood as 'and them to me'; and nu-mu-smas with dative-accusative -mu- and dative-accusative -smas- is understood as 'and me to them'. A string *nu-ssi-mu with -mu in dative function is not possible. Two accusative pronouns may also not cooccur. Therefore, a string like *n-an-us with the third person singular animate accusative pronoun -an- and the animate accusative plural pronoun is not a possible string.

A string with an accusative pronoun in direct object function will not have an enclitic pronoun in nominative function. Therefore, strings such as *nu-as-an with nominative singular animate -as- and accusative singular animate -an, and *n-e-an with nominative plural animate -e- and accusative singular animate -an, are not possible. This is because the enclitic nominative pronoun is used only with certain intransitive verbs.

18 Enclitic possessive pronouns
In addition to the tonic and enclitic personal pronouns, there was also a series of enclitic possessive pronouns in the archaic language. The pronouns are attached to the nouns they modify, and they agree in case and number with the nouns, for example: genitive attas-mas 'of my father' or dative-locative kissari-ti 'in your hand'. There are, however, no distinct forms for the ablative; where an ablative is required, the forms of the instrumental are used. These pronouns are found in early texts, in later copies of earlier texts, and in texts from the Empire period in which the content is traditional, such as myths, prayers, rituals, and festivals. Although the enclitic possessives seem robust in the oldest texts, the evidence suggests that they had dropped out of use in the living language by the Empire period, having been replaced by genitive forms of the tonic pronouns. Although Akkadian enclitic possessive pronouns are found in texts from all periods, it seems likely that by the Empire period, they were read with the genitives of the tonic pronouns rather than with Hittite enclitic pronouns. The enclitic possessive pronouns are clearly related to the enclitic and tonic personal pronouns, though the third person possessive pronoun resembles the defective third person pronouns -sye- and enclitic dative -ssi rather than a-. In the first, second, and third person possessive pronouns, stems with the vowel a alternate with stems with the vowels e and i. The second and third person enclitic possessives, which also have alternating stems, appear to be shortened forms of the tonic pronouns to judge from variant forms like the third person plural nominative-accusative neuter singular -summit and the dative-locative singular -summi.

There are enclitic possessive pronouns for the first, second, and third persons singular:

 	 	1st person	 	2nd person	 	3rd person
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	-mis, -mas	 	-tis	 	-sis, -sas
acc.	 	-man, -min	 	-tin	 	-san, -sin
nom/acc. neut.	 	-met, -mit	 	-tit	 	-sit, -set
gen.	 	-mas	 	-tas	 	-sas
dat/loc.	 	-mi	 	-ti	 	-si
inst.	 	-mit	 	-tit	 	-set, -sit
all.	 	-ma	 	-ta	 	-sa
voc.	 	-mi	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	-mis	 	-tis	 	-ses, -sis
acc.	 	-mus	 	-tus	 	-sus
nom/acc. neut.	 	-mit, -met	 	 	 	-set
gen.	 	-man	 	 	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	-tas	 	 
There are also pronouns for the second and third person plural. A first person plural enclitic possessive does not seem to occur.

 	 	2nd person	 	3rd person
Singular	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	-smis	 	-smes
acc.	 	 	 	-sman
nom/acc. neut.	 	-smet	 	-summit, -smet
gen.	 	 	 	 
dat/loc.	 	-smi	 	-summi, -smi
inst.	 	 	 	smit
all.	 	 	 	-sma
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	-smes	 	 
acc.	 	 	 	-smus
nom/acc. neut.	 	 	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	-smas
The following are some examples:

 	 	kisras-ma-ssi	 	galulupēs-ses	 	talugaēs
 	 	of hand-but-her	 	fingers	 	long
 	 	n-at-kan	 	miyawēs-pat	 	galulupēs
 	 	and-they-locatival	 	soft-indeed	 	fingers
 	 	"The fingers of her hand are long and they are indeed soft fingers."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	HUR.SAGTudhaliyas	 	pēdi-ti	 	ēs
 	 	Mt. Tudhaliyas	 	place-in-your	 	be
 	 	"Mt. Tudhaliyas, remain in your place!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	GIŠTUKULHI.A-us-sus-sta	 	ZAG.LU.ZA	 	dāhhun	 	 
 	 	weapons-their-locatival	 	shoulder	 	from	 	I took
 	 	"I took their weapons from their shoulder(s)."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-mu	 	wasdul-mit	 	teddu
 	 	and-to me	 	sin-my	 	let him tell
 	 	"Let him tell me my sin."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kardi-smi-ya-at-kan	 	dāhhun
 	 	heart-and-your (pl.)-it-locatival	 	I took
 	 	"And from your heart I have taken it (illness)."
The enclitic possessives are used in archaic texts after spatial adverbs, for example: se-e-er-sa-me-et (for sēr-smet 'above them'), or peran-tit 'before you'.

18.1 Sound Changes Accompanying Enclitic Possessives
The final -s of a noun is lost before a pronoun beginning with s, for example, *arēs-smes 'your companions' becomes arēs-mes.

In some texts, the final n of an accusative singular is subject to changes before the initial consonant of an enclitic possessive. The final n of the animate accusative singular may be lost before a pronoun beginning with s, for example, *arhan-ssan 'its border' shows up as arha-ssan.

The final n of the accusative may be lost or it may become m before the initial m of the first person singular pronoun. In the following sentence sahhan-met 'my feudal duty' shows up as sahha-met with the final n of sahhan 'feudal duty' lost before the m of the first person pronoun:

 	 	kī	 	GIŠTUKUL-li-met	 	kī-ma	 	sahha-met
 	 	this	 	craft-my	 	this-but	 	feudal duty-my
 	 	"This is my craft, but this is my feudal duty"
In this sentence, from an archaic prayer, the final n of the accusative becomes m:

 	 	nu-za	 	tuekkam-mam	 	natta	 	paprahhun
 	 	and-reflexive	 	body-my	 	not	 	defiled
 	 	"I have not defiled my body."
19 The Dative-Locative
The Hittite dative-locative combines the forms and functions of two Indo-European case forms. The dative, the case used to signal a recipient, beneficiary, or goal of motion, and the locative, the case used to indicate where action was located. The ending -i, which is most common, is either from the Indo-European dative ending *-ei or from the Indo-European locative ending *-i. A few archaic locatives, so-called endingless locatives, are made with the bare stem (e.g., tagān 'on earth'), but the ending -i tended to spread at the expense of the endingless locative in most paradigms.

19.1 Indirect Objects
The dative is the case of the indirect object, recipient, or beneficiary:

 	 	nu-war-an	 	ammuk	 	parā pāi
 	 	and-quotative-him	 	to me (dat)	 	give over
 	 	"Give him over to me."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-ssi	 	hatrānun
 	 	and-to-him (dat.)	 	I wrote
 	 	"And I wrote to him."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-ssi	 	ABU-YA	 	TUPPAHI.A	 	RIKILTI	 	iyat
 	 	and-for him (dat.)	 	father-my	 	tablets	 	treaty	 	made
 	 	"My father made treaty tablets for him."
Nouns in the dative, whether inflected or not, may be accompanied by the Akkadian preposition ANA 'to'. When ANA precedes a Sumerogram or Akkadogram without a phonetic complement, or when it precedes a personal or place name in the stem form, it is a graphic indicator that the word that follows is a dative. The Akkadian preposition may, however, be used redundantly before Hittite nouns in the dative or before Sumerograms or Akkadograms with phonetic complements that indicate that they are datives:

 	 	A-NA	 	MUhha-LÚ-ma	 	LÚTE4MU	 	wiyanun
 	 	to	 	to Uhhazitti-moreover (dat.)	 	a messenger	 	I sent
 	 	"Moreover, to Uhhaziti I sent a messenger."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-mu	 	A-NA	 	DINGIRLIM	 	ARAD-anni	 	pesta
 	 	and-me	 	to	 	of the deity	 	the service (dat.)	 	he gave
 	 	"He gave me to the service of the deity."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-wa	 	memiyan	 	ANA	 	DUTUŠI	 	hatrāi
 	 	and-quotative	 	word	 	to	 	to my majesty (dat.)	 	write
 	 	"Send word to my majesty (by letter)."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	INA	 	KUR	 	URULawzantiya	 	ANA	 	DINGIRLIM	 	BAL-uwanzi
 	 	to	 	country	 	Lawanzantiyas	 	to	 	the deity (dat.)	 	to sacrifice
 	 	iyahhahat	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	I went	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"I went to the country of Lawanzantiyas to sacrifice to the deity."
19.2 Dative of Goal
With verbs of motion, the dative-locative may indicate a goal:

 	 	n-as	 	mahhan	 	wappui	 	ari
 	 	and-she	 	when	 	at the riverbank (dat.)	 	arrives
 	 	"And when she arrives at the river bank..."
19.3 Possessive Dative
A dative in sentences with forms of the verb "to be" has a possessive sense. Such sentences can often be translated by English sentences with "to have":

 	 	nu-mu	 	É-er	 	kuit	 	ēsta
 	 	and-to me (dat.)	 	house	 	what	 	was
 	 	"What house I had (lit. 'What house was to me')..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kanissūwar-wa-mu	 	ŠA	 	DIŠTAR-pat	 	GAŠAN-YA	 	ēsta
 	 	favor-quotative-to me (dat.)	 	of	 	Ishtar-herself	 	Lady-my	 	was
 	 	"I had the favor or my lady Ishtar herself (lit. 'To me was the favor of my lady Ishtar herself')."
The possessive dative is also found in so-called nominal sentences in which a present form of "be" has been elided:

 	 	ANA	 	MHattusili-wa	 	MU.KAMHI.A	 	maninkuwantes
 	 	to	 	Hattusilis (dat.)-quotative	 	years	 	short
 	 	"Hattusilis' years are short."
19.4 The Dative with Adjectives
The dative is used with adjectives indicating feelings, such as assu- 'dear' and nahhant- 'careful, respectful, fearful', to indicate the object of the emotion:

 	 	n-asta	 	DIŠKUR-unni-ma	 	mān	 	āssus	 	ēsta
 	 	and-locatival	 	to the Stormgod (dat.)	 	when	 	dear	 	he was
 	 	"And when he was dear to the Stormgod..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	wēs	 	DINGIRMEŠ-as	 	kuit	 	nahhantes
 	 	and	 	we	 	to the gods (dat.)	 	because	 	respectful
 	 	"Because we are respectful to the gods..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	mān	 	ANA	 	SAL.LUGAL	 	āssu
 	 	and	 	if	 	to	 	to the queen (dat.)	 	agreeable
 	 	"If it is agreeable to the queen..."
19.5 The Ethical Dative
Hittite has a construction like the "ethical dative" of many of the other Indo-European languages. In such constructions, a pronoun in the dative indicates that the subject of the sentence is the beneficiary of some action. The pronoun may often be translated with an English reflexive pronoun.

 	 	lē-ta	 	nāhi
 	 	negative-yourself (dat.)	 	fear
 	 	"Don't fear for yourself."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-nnas	 	DUMU.NITAMEŠ	 	DUMU.MUNUSMEŠ	 	iyawen
 	 	and-for ourselves (dat.)	 	sons	 	(and) daughters	 	we made
 	 	"And we had sons and daughters for ourselves."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	LU-as-wa-mu-kan	 	BA.UŠ
 	 	man-quotative-me (dat)-locatival	 	died
 	 	"My husband died on me."
19.6 Dative with Comparatives
Comparative consructions are relatively rare in Hittite, but the dative is the case used for the standard against which something is compared:

 	 	nu-wa-kan	 	ANA	 	ERÍNMEŠ-KA	 	ERÍNMEŠ-YA	 	mekki
 	 	and-quotative-locatival	 	to	 	army-my (dat.)	 	army-your	 	numerous
 	 	"My army is more numerous than your army."
20 I-Stem Adjectives and Nouns
Hittite had a number of i-stem adjectives and nouns formed with suffixes containing a suffix -i-, which become -y- before vowels. This suffix was often spelled iy before a, and was normally spelled -i- before e. To this suffix, nominal and adjectival endings were added. As with the u-stems, nouns and adjectives were affected by various analogical changes. For example, adjectives sometimes took nominal inflection and vice versa. Originally, however, the adjectives had a suffix of the shape -i- in the nominative and accusative singular animate, in the neuter singular, and in the neuter nominative accusative plural. This suffix alternated with a suffix beginning with a in the rest of the paradigm. The paradigm was, however, affected by a sound change in which y was lost between vowels fairly early, and i-stems sometimes have case forms in -a- plus ending; in other words, individual forms of i-stem adjectives can look like a-stems. The y, however, tended to be analogically restored, and case forms with a suffix -ay- before vowels are also found. The original form of the neuter nominative-accusative plural ended in the suffix -i, likely with regular lengthening of the suffix vowel, but this was eventually replaced by a form -iy-a with the neuter nominative-accusative ending -a of other nouns and adjectives. The paradigm of the adjective salli- 'big, great' is representative:

 	 	animate	 	 	 	neuter
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	sall-i-s	 	 	 	sall-i
acc.	 	sall-i-n	 	 	 	sall-i
gen.	 	 	 	sal-as, sall-ay-as	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	sall-ai	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	sall-az, sall-ay-az	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	sall-a-es, sall-ay-es	 	 	 	sall-ī, sall-iy-a
acc.	 	sall-ay-us, sall-i-us	 	 	 	sall-ī, sall-iy-a
In addition to the i-stem adjectives, there are also a handful of adjectives in which a suffix -i-, -y- is added to a stem in final -u, which is often spelled uw before vowels. As with other i-stem adjectives, forms in which the y of the suffix has been lost between vowels are found beside forms in which y has been restored analogically. The nominative-accusative neuter also originally ended in -i, but the regular nominative-accusative plural ending -a was eventually extended to these forms. Occasionally, forms that follow the declension of i-stem nouns occur, for example, nominative plural animate parku-y-ēs for parkuw-ay-ēs 'pure'. The paradigm of parkui- 'pure' is representative:

 	 	animate	 	 	 	neuter
Singular	 	 	 	 	 	parku-i
nom.	 	parku-i-s	 	 	 	parku-i
acc.	 	parku-i-n

acc.	 	 	 	 	 	parku-i, parkuw-ay-a
loc.	 	 	 	parkuw-ay-as	 	 
The declension of the i-stem nouns parallels that of u-stem nouns. The suffix has the shape -i- or -y- before vowels throughout the paradigm. The words halki- 'grain' and pūri- 'lip, rim, edge' provide representative examples of animate i-stem nouns. Halki- is used as a collective in the plural, and a collective form with the neuter plural ending halki is found. Halki- is also often attested as DHalki- 'deified grain'. Pūri- is well attested in the plural as an animate noun.

inst.	 	 	 	pūr-i-t
Beside the nouns with a suffix -i-, -iy- throughout their paradigms, there are also a handful of nouns in which a suffix -i-, -iy- alternates with a suffix -āi-, -āy-. Although the inflection of nouns of this type may in some cases have been influenced by the inflection of the nouns with -i-, -iy-, the declension of these nouns was originally parallel to that of the nouns in -āu-, -āw-. The noun lingāi- 'oath', which is very common, is mostly animate, although a few neuter forms, are found, while hastāi- 'bone' is neuter. The agreement of adjectives and nouns suggests that at least some ostensibly singular forms of the latter are best taken as collectives meaning "bones." Loss of y between vowels is found in forms like animate accusative ling-a-us for *ling-ay-us. The dative-locatives lingāi and hastāi have a suffix and ending that is presumably from *ay:-i or *-ay:-ei with contraction of the suffix and ending.

The neuter noun kēr, kard-, kardi- 'heart' is anomalous in having three stems. One stem, kēr, normally written as the Akkadogram ŠÀ with phonetic complement (i.e. ŠÀ-er) is found in the nominative-accusative singular and plural and with the dative-locative ending -i. The stem kard- is found in the ablative and allative, while the i-stem kard-i-, kard-iya- occurs in the genitive and in the instrumental. The dative-locative kard-i is presumably also an i-stem form.

Lesson 5
Sara E. Kimball, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
Muršiliš II (roughly 1321-1295 B.C.) took over the Hittite kingdom at its height after a brief reign by his brother Arnuwandaš II (roughly 1322-1321). His father, Šuppiluliumaš (roughly 1344-1322) had rebuilt the capital, Hattusa, known today as Boğazköy, and reorganized local government, establishing the so-called New Kingdom which was maintained from the time of his accession to approximately 1200 B.C. He conducted a successful campaign against Arzawa in southwestern Anatolia while maintaining conflicts with the kingdom of Mitanni in the southeast and establishing a firm foothold in Syria. Muršiliš continued the warfare, as indicated by the first selection from his Annals given here regarding Arzawa.

The second selection illustrates how he solidified his control, first to the land of the Seha river to the east and then to the country of Mira to the southeast. In the third selection we are informed that he did not take over the mountainous land of Azzi to the far east of Anatolia, but was content to control the citizens as vassals. While we have no knowledge of the activities of the sixth year Festival, his attendance at it signifies that under his control the Hittite kingdom enjoyed peace while also being at its highest level.

Reading and Textual Analysis
One of the remarkable features of Muršiliš's rule was the production of annals. Among these is a set concerning the military deeds of his father, but that has been poorly maintained. On his own career he compiled two, one a lengthy account covering his entire career, and the other exerpted here covering the first ten years of his reign. Besides informing us of his military activities it illustrates his social and religious activities.

The second excerpt illustrates how he solidified his control over areas that he and his father had conquered, establishing social ties as well as military assistance. By different procedures indicated in the third selection he protects the country of Azzi without taking over its governance. His success in general, as in Arzawa he credits to the Stormgod, here labeled Mighty, and also to another deity not included in these excerpts, the Sungodess of Arinna, who was the highest female Divine among the earlier Hattic peoples and then maintained as special protector of the Hittite kings. His annals may have been prompted by accounts kept by the Bablyonian rulers and are the fullest of any of the Hittite rulers.

Lines 9b-19 are taken from Year 3 of the Annals: KBo III 4 = 2 BoTU 48.
Lines 33-45 are taken from Year 4 of the Annals: KUB XIV 15 = 2 BoTU 51 B(B).
Lines 28-41 are taken from Year 10 of the Annals: KBo IV 4 = 2 BoTU 58 B.

Translation
Year 3; lines 9b-19: But, to Uhhaziti I sent a messenger. I wrote him: "My subjects who came to you, because I now demanded (them) back, you have not given (them) back to me. And you have been calling me a child; and you have been belittling me. Now come on: we will fight one another. And the Stormgod, my lord, decide our case." And as I marched, when I arrived at Mt. Lawasa, then the mighty Stormgod, my lord, displayed (his) divine might. He hurled a thunderbolt. And my troops saw the thunderbolt and the country of Arzawa saw the thunderbolt. The thunderbolt went and struck the country of Arzawa and it struck Apasa, Uhhaziti's city.
Year 4; lines 33-45: I took Manappa-Datta of the Seha river land as vassal. And moreover I went back to the country of Mira and I fortified the country of Mira. Moreover, I built the cities Arsanini, Sarawa, and Impa and fortified them and garrisoned them with troops. And I garrisoned the city of Hapanuwa with troops. Furthermore, In Mira, I set up Mashuiluwas in overlordship. And I said the following to Mashuiluwas: "You, Mashuiluwas, came before my father as a fugitive and my father took you in and made you his son-in-law and gave you Muwattis, his daughter, my sister, in marriage. But he could not be concerned with you and (he could not) attack your enemies for you. But I am concerned with you, and I have attacked your enemies for you. And, moreover, I have built cities and fortified them and garrisoned them with troops. And I have settled you in lordship in Mira."
Year 10; lines 28-41: But when the people of Azzi saw that I had started taking fortified cities in battle, the people of Azzi, who held out in fortified cities, fortified rock forts, high mountains and high places, they became afraid. Then the elders of the county came before me and prostrated themselves at my feet. And they said to me: "Our lord, do not destroy us, Take us, our lord, into vassalship, and we will begin providing to our lord infantry and chariot fighters. And the Hittite captive who is among us, we will hand him over." Moreover, I, my majesty, did not destroy them and I took them in vassalship and I made them vassals. And because the year had become short for me, I did not fortify (Azzi); instead, I put the people of Azzi under oath and then I went to Hattusas and I spent the winter in Hattusas. Festivals of the sixth year (there).

21 Iya-stem Adjectives and Nouns
A number of adjectives and a handful of nouns have a suffix -iya-. In some instances, forms with -iya- are found beside i-stem forms. Some of the nouns of this type may be former i-stems that have taken on a-stem inflection. Others, which were originally iya-stems, may either have adopted i-stem inflection by analogy, or they may have undergone a sound change in which the final a of the suffix was dropped. The adjective hantezziya- 'first', which is quite common, and which is sometimes spelled with the Sumerogram IGI plus phonetic complement, provides representative examples.

22 r/n-stem nouns
Hittite has a number of neuter nouns in which a stem in -r, normally found in the nominative-accusative singular and plural, and sometimes in the locative singular, alternates with a stem in -n-. In the other Indo-European languages this is an archaic inflection retained only in scattered remnants, but Hittite not only possesses a number of archaic nouns with the original inflection fairly intact, the -r, -n- stem type of inflection is productive in Hittite and is used to form several kinds of verbal nouns.

The most archaic nouns of this type, such as wātar 'water' or ēshar 'blood', show an alternation both in the shapes of their roots and in the shapes of their suffixes according to case. Wātar retains the old collective-plural suffix -ār in its nominative-accusative plural, while the attested forms of ēshar may reflect a mix of inherited singular and plural-collective forms.

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	wāt-ar	 	ēsh-ar
gen.	 	wit-en-as	 	ēs-n-as, ish-an-as, ēsh-an-as
dat/loc.	 	wit-en-i	 	ēs-n-i, ish-an-i
abl.	 	wit-en-az	 	ish-an-za
inst.	 	wid-an-ta	 	ēsh-an-ta
all.	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	wid-ār	 	 
The early instrumental widanta was later replaced by witenit, with a stem witen- based on the stem of the genitive, dative, and ablative. The loss of h between consonants in genitive ēsnas and dative ēsni may have occurred in Indo-European or it may have been an inner Hittite development. Forms such as genitive ishanas were possibly inherited from an Indo-European collective inflection. It seems likely that forms with the stem ēsh-an- have adopted the root of the nominative-accusative.

In pāhhur 'fire' the suffix alternates between -ur in the nominative-accusative singular and -wen- elsewhere in the paradigm, while in mēhur 'time', the suffix of the nominative-accusative is -ur and the suffix of the rest of the paradimg is -un-:

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	pāhh-ur	 	mēh-ur
gen.	 	pāhh-wen-as	 	mēh-un-as
dat/loc.	 	pāhh-wen-i	 	mēh-in-i
abl.	 	pāhh-wen-az	 	*mēh-un-az
inst.	 	pāhh-wen-it	 	 
all.	 	 	 	*mēh-un-a
Two other nouns, uttar 'word, thing, affair' and pattar 'basket, tray', have a suffix -ar that alternates with a suffix -an-. The plural of uttar, uddār also retains the old collective suffix -ār.

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	utt-ar	 	patt-ar
gen.	 	utt-an-as	 	*patt-an-as
dat/loc.	 	udd-an-ī	 	patt-an-ī
abl.	 	udd-an-az	 	patt-an-az
inst.	 	udd-an-ta	 	patt-an-it
all.	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	udd-ār	 	 
dat/loc.	 	udd-an-as	 	 
22.1 Complex Suffixes
Other neuter nouns of this type have complex suffixes which are the product of adding the suffixes -r and -n- to already existing nominal stems, some of which were themselves formed from verbal stems. Many of these nouns also have close relationships to verbs from which the base nouns were derived. Nouns in -āwar, -āun-, such as asāwar 'sheepfold' and patāwar 'feather' seem originally to have been formed from -ā-stem nouns. The root of asāwar is related to the root as- beside ēs- 'be':

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	as-āwar	 	part-āwar
gen.	 	*as-āun-as	 	part-āun-as
dat.	 	as-āun-i	 	*part-āu-ni
abl.	 	as-āun-az	 	part-āun-az
inst.	 	*as-āun-it	 	part-āun-it
all.	 	 	 	 
The complex suffix -essar, -esn- forms verbal nouns, for example, hannessar, 'law case, judgment' comes from hann- 'litigate, decide a court case'.

Singular	 	 
nom/acc.	 	hanness-ar
gen.	 	hannes-n-as
dat.	 	hannes-n-i
abl.	 	hanness-n-az
inst.	 	hannes-n-it
all.	 	 
The suffix -ātar is used to form abstract nouns from verbs. In nouns of this type, the nominative-accusative -ātar alternates with a suffix -ānn- from *-ādn-. A frozen form of the allative -ānna forms one type of infinitive. Paprātar 'impurity', which is well attested, beside the verbs papre- 'be proven guilty' (i.e. 'impure'), papress- 'become impure', and paprahh- 'defile, make impure' is a representative noun of this type:

Singular	 	 
nom/acc.	 	paprātar
gen.	 	paprānn-as
dat.	 	paprānn-i
abl.	 	paprānn-aza
inst.	 	*paprānn-it
all.	 	*paprānn-a
Verbal abstract nouns in -war, have a genitive in -was, from an earlier -wons with a regular sound change of ns to s. The suffix in -n is preserved in the supine in -wan, from an original endingless locative, and in the infinitive in -wanzi from an original dative. Because original sequences of uw became um, verbs with stems in final -u- make verbal nouns in -mar, -mas, supines with the suffix -uman, and infinitives in -umanzi. The verbal nouns are often found in the genitive in expressions like: taknāz dāuwas 'taking from the earth' with dāuwas, genitive of dāwar, the verbal noun of dā- 'take', zahhiyas pēdan 'place of battle, battlefield' with the genitive of zahhiyawar from zahhiya- 'fight'.

22.2 Pēr, parn- 'house'
The noun *pēr 'house' (normally written É-er) has a stem par-n- in forms other than the nominative-accusative singular and plural. In the locative, the forms *pēr without ending and *pēr-i (written É-er and É-ri or É-i) are found beside parn-i:

Singular	 	 
nom/acc.	 	*pēer, Éer
gen.	 	par-n-as
dat/loc.	 	par-n-i, *pēr, *pēr-i
abl.	 	par-n-az
inst.	 	 
all.	 	par-n-a
Plural	 	 
nom/acc.	 	*pēr, É-er
gen.	 	*par-n-as
dat/loc.	 	par-n-as
23 The Locative
The locative is the case that indicates the place in which an object or action is located.

 	 	nu	 	É-ri-ssi	 	anneskezzi
 	 	and	 	in house-his (loc.)	 	he works
 	 	"And he shall work in his house."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	pēdi-ssi-ma	 	ZÀ.HA.LI-an	 	anenun
 	 	in place (loc.)-its-(loc.)-and	 	cress	 	I sowed
 	 	"And on its site I sowed cress."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-ssan	 	kē	 	hūman	 	GIpaddanī	 	katta handaizzi
 	 	and-locatival	 	this	 	all	 	in a basket (loc.)	 	she arranges
 	 	"And all this she arranges in a basket."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-kan	 	Éh:li	 	sāwātar	 	pariparāi
 	 	and-locatival	 	in yard (loc.)	 	the horn	 	she blows
 	 	"And in the yard she blows the horn."
23.1 Abstract locative
The locative may be abstract in meaning:

 	 	namma	 	INA	 	URUMirā	 	MMashuiluwan	 	EN-iznanni	 	tittanunun
 	 	moreover	 	in	 	the City of Mira	 	Mashuiluwa	 	in lordship (loc.)	 	I established
 	 	"And I established Mashuilas in lordship in the city of Mira."
23.2 Action in time
The locative is used in adverbial expressions locating action in time, for example:

 	 	GIM-an-ma	 	hameshi	 	tethai
 	 	When-but	 	in spring (loc.)	 	it thunders
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	URUNēsan	 	ispandi	 	nakkit	 	dās
 	 	and	 	Nesa	 	in the night (loc.)	 	by force	 	I took
 	 	"And I took Nesa in the night by force"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	hantezzi-kan	 	UD-ti	 	UDUiyantan	 	inanas	 	DUTU-i
 	 	in-first (loc)-locatival	 	in day (loc.)	 	sheep	 	of illness	 	to the Sungod
 	 	sipantahhi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	I sacrifice	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"On the first day I offer a sheep to the Sungod of illness."
24 The Imperative
The second person singular and plural of the imperative function as do imperatives in the other Indo-European languages, to indicate commands.

 	 	ammel-kan	 	assul	 	PANI	 	MPulli	 	halzai
 	 	my-locatival	 	greetings	 	before	 	Pulli	 	read
 	 	"Read my greetings to Pulli."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ÚHI.A-uss-a-kan	 	arha	 	hūdāk	 	waras
 	 	grass-and-locatival	 	down	 	immediately	 	cut
 	 	"Cut down the grass immediately."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at-mu	 	tuppiaz	 	hatrāi
 	 	and-it-to-me	 	with a tablet	 	write
 	 	"Write it to me with a tablet!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	kuedani	 	DINAM	 	ēszi	 	n-at-si	 	hanni
 	 	and	 	to whoever	 	a law case	 	is	 	and-it-for him	 	judge
 	 	n-an-kan	 	asnut	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-him-locatival	 	set right	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Whoever has a law case, judge it for him and set him right."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	tuliyan	 	halzisten
 	 	and	 	the assembly	 	call (pl.)
 	 	"Call the assembly!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-ssan	 	apiya	 	iyaddumat
 	 	and-locatival	 	there	 	go (pl.)
 	 	"Go there!"
24.1 Third person imperative
The third person imperative has modal-like functions. It can express a wish, or it can express a sense of obligation or of futurity. Often, it can act as an indirect sort of imperative, comparable to constructions in English with "shall," "should," "may," or "must."

 	 	LUGAL-us	 	MUNUS.LUGAL-ass-a	 	huiswantes	 	asandu
 	 	the king	 	the queen-and	 	alive	 	may they be
 	 	"May the king and queen live! (i.e. 'Long live the king and queen!')"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	na-at	 	DUMU.NAM.LU.U19.LU-as	 	istamasdu
 	 	and-it	 	mankind	 	let them hear
 	 	"And let mankind hear it."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-tta	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	assuli	 	pahsantaru
 	 	and-you	 	the gods	 	in benevolence	 	may they protect
 	 	"May the gods protect you in benevolence."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	auriyas	 	EN-as	 	DINAM	 	SIG5-in	 	hannau
 	 	and	 	of watchtower	 	lord	 	law case	 	well	 	let him judge
 	 	"The border lord should judge the case well (or 'Let the border lord judge the case well')."
24.2 Voluntive
The first person singular imperative, sometimes called a voluntive, expresses a wish, or may have a modal-like sense.

 	 	teshit	 	uwallu
 	 	with dream	 	let me see
 	 	"Let me see (it) in (lit 'with') a dream."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-mu	 	apppatar	 	hatrāttin
 	 	and-to-me	 	receipt	 	write
 	 	nu	 	seggalu	 	 
 	 	and	 	I may know	 	 
 	 	"Write me a receipt, so that I may know."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	zig-a	 	attas-mis	 	ēs	 	ug-a	 	DUMU-as	 	ēslit
 	 	but-you	 	father-my	 	be	 	I-but	 	son	 	let me be
 	 	"You be my father and let me be (your) son."
Although there is no special form for the first person plural imperative, the first person plural of the indicative can also be used to express a wish:

 	 	kinun-a-wa	 	ehu	 	nu-wa	 	zahhiyawastati	 	 
 	 	now-but-quotative	 	come on	 	and-quotative	 	we fight	 	 
 	 	nu-wa-nnas	 	DU	 	BELI-YA	 	DINAM	 	hannāu
 	 	and-quotative-for-us	 	the Stormgod	 	lord-my	 	case	 	let judge
 	 	"Now come, let us fight (or 'we will fight'); let the Stormgod, my lord, judge the case for us."
24.3 Negative adverb lē
Forms of the second person present and third person present can also have imperative or modal force when used with the negative adverb lē.

 	 	memiyann-a-ssi	 	lē	 	mematti
 	 	word-but-to-her	 	not	 	you speak
 	 	"You should not speak a word to her."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	sarāzzi	 	DI-sar	 	lē	 	katterahtēni
 	 	and	 	superior	 	court case	 	not	 	make low
 	 	kattera-ma	 	hannessar	 	lē	 	sarāzziyahteni	 	 
 	 	inferior-but	 	court case	 	not	 	make superior	 	 
 	 	"Do not disparage a superior court case, nor make an inferior case prevail."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-wa	 	BĒLĪNĪ-NI	 	INA	 	URUHayasa	 	lē	 	pāisi
 	 	and-quotative	 	lord-our	 	against	 	Hayassa	 	not	 	he goes
 	 	"Let our lord not go against Hayasa."
24.4 Archaic forms of "come, go"
Hittite preserves two archaic forms of the imperative of the verb meaning "come, go." One, ehu can be roughly translated as "come" or "come on!"

 	 	kinun-a-wa	 	ehu	 	nu-wa	 	zahhiyawastati
 	 	now-but-quotative	 	come on	 	and-quotative	 	we fight
 	 	"Now come, let us fight!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	arunaz	 	ehu
 	 	from the sea	 	come on
 	 	"From the sea, come!"
The other archaic imperative, ī-, is preserved in the second person singular īt and the second person plural ītten.

 	 	īt-wa	 	ANA	 	DIM	 	URUHatti	 	BELÍ-YA
 	 	go-quotative	 	to	 	Stormgod	 	of Hatti	 	lord-my
 	 	"Go to the Stormgod of Hatti, my lord!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ītten	 	azzikatten	 	akkuskatten
 	 	go	 	keep eating	 	keep drinking
 	 	"Go, keep eating (and) drinking (i.e., 'remain alive')!"
The two may be used together:

 	 	ehu	 	hāras	 	īt
 	 	come on	 	eagle	 	go
 	 	"Come on eagle, go!"
25 The quotative particle
The quotative particle -war- is used to indicate quoted speech. It takes the form -war- when it occurs before enclitics beginning with vowels, and it shows up as -wa- when it occurs before enclitics beginning with consonants. At the end of a phrase, it also shows up as -wa:

nu-war-an and-quotative-him
nu-war-asta and-quotative-locatival
nu-wa-tta and-quotative-you
nu-wa-za and-quotative-reflexive
nu-wa and-quotative
Normally, -war- is attached to the first word of each clause in a passage of quoted speech, as in the following passage from the Apology of Hattusilis III that quotes what Ishtar said to Hattusilis' father, Mursilis, in a dream. Note that the quotative particle can be rendered in English as "saying":

 	 	nu	 	DISTAR	 	GASAN-YA	 	ANA	 	MMursli
 	 	and	 	Ishtar	 	lady-my	 	to	 	Mursilis
 	 	A.BI-YA	 	Ù-et	 	MNIR.GÀL-in	 	ŠEŠ-YA	 	wiyat
 	 	father-my	 	with dream	 	Muwattallis	 	brother-my	 	sent
 	 	ANA	 	MHattusli-wa	 	MU.KAMHI.A	 	maninkuwantes	 	 
 	 	for	 	Hattusilis-quotative	 	years	 	short	 	 
 	 	ŪL-war-as	 	TI-annas	 	nu-war-an	 	ammuk	 	 
 	 	not-quotative-he	 	of life	 	and-quotative-him	 	to me	 	 
 	 	parā pāi	 	nu-war-as-mu	 	LÙsankunnis	 	ēsdu	 	 
 	 	hand over	 	and-quotative-he-to me	 	priest	 	let be	 	 
 	 	nu-war-as	 	TI-anza	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-quotative-he	 	living	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Ishtar, My Lady, sent Muwattalis, my brother, to my father, Mursilis by means of a dream, (saying): 'For Hattusilis(-wa), the years are short. He(-war) is not for life. Give him(-war) to me and let him(-war) be my priest. Then he(-war) (will) live.'"
Quoted speech may also be introduced by a verb of speaking or saying:

 	 	nu	 	siunan	 	antusiss-a	 	tarsikkanzi
 	 	and	 	of gods	 	men-and	 	are saying
 	 	kāsa-wa	 	URUHattusi	 	ēshar	 	pangariyattati
 	 	look-quotative	 	in Hattusas	 	bloodshed	 	has become widespread
 	 	"And now the men of the gods are saying: 'Look(-wa) bloodshed has become widespread in Hattusas.'"
Sometimes the adverb kissan "thus" or "the following" is used, with or without a verb of speaking or saying, to introduce quoted speech:

 	 	nu	 	wet	 	ABI	 	DUTUŠI	 	ANA	 	MMadduwatta
 	 	and	 	came	 	father	 	of my majesty	 	to	 	Madduwattas
 	 	kissan	 	namma	 	memista	 	kāsa-wa-tta	 	 	 	 
 	 	thus	 	moreover	 	said	 	look-quotative-to-you	 	 	 	 
 	 	KÚR	 	HUR.SAGZippaslā	 	ADDIN	 	nu-wa-za	 	 	 	 
 	 	country	 	Mt. Zippasala	 	I have given	 	and-quotative-reflexive	 	 	 	 
 	 	apūn-pat	 	esi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	that-itself	 	be	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"And the father of my majesty came (and), moreover, said the following, to you, Madduwattas, 'Look,(-war) to you I have given the mountain land of Zippasla; so(-wa) occupy it!'"
The verb hatrāi- 'write' is treated as a verb of speaking, and quotations from letters are marked with the quotative particle -war-, -wa-. In the following, the king is quoting a letter that he has received from one provincial official to two other officials to whom he is writing:

 	 	kāsa-mu	 	MPisenis	 	URUKasepuraz	 	hatraīit	 	 
 	 	look-to me	 	Piseni	 	from Kasepura	 	wrote	 	 
 	 	LÚKÚR-wa	 	pangarit	 	ispandaz	 	 	 	 
 	 	enemy-quotative	 	in force	 	by night	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuwapi	 	VI ME	 	LÚKÚR	 	kuwapi-ma	 	IV ME
 	 	in place	 	600	 	enemy	 	in place-but	 	400
 	 	LÚKÚR	 	yattaru	 	nu-wa-kan	 	halkius	 	arha waraskezzi
 	 	enemy	 	is marching	 	and-quotative	 	grain	 	harvests up
 	 	"Look, Piseni wrote me from Kasepura: 'The enemy(-wa) is marching in force by night -- 600 enemy in one place, 400 enemy in another, and he(-wa) is harvesting up the grain.'"
Lesson 6
Sara E. Kimball and Jonathan Slocum
This document, called by modern scholars the "Apology (apologia) of Hattusilis III" recounts the life and military exploits of one of the most successful Hittite kings. Not only was Hattusilis successful in his military exploits, both before and after his assumption of the kingship, he and his wife, Puduhepa, instituted religious reforms within the Hittite kingdom and engaged in extensive diplomatic relations with other great powers of the time such as Egypt and Assyria. As in other historical texts from the Empire period, the king is shown as the beneficiary of divine aid from a special protector. In this document, the deity who protects Hattusilis from his sickly childhood throughout his reign is the Goddess Ishtar. She not only aids him in battle, but she also guides the major events of his personal life.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Hattusilis, the youngest son of Mursilis, was, by his own account, a frail child. In the first two paragraphs (document sections 2-3), Ishtar, in the guise of Hattusilis's brother Muwattallis, appears to his father in a dream and demands that he hand the child over to serve her as priest. This apparently did have the intended effect of strengthening the child and prolonging his life, since Hattusilis went on to become a successful general, serving under his brother king Muwattallis and reestablishing control over the territory charged to his command.

The 3rd paragraph (from document section 9) concerns another crucial event in Hattusilis's life: his marriage to Puduhepa, daughter of Pentipsarris, a priest in the Kizzuwatnan town of Lawanzantiyas. Queen Puduhepa, who was also a priestess in the service of Ishtar, was a formidable personality in her own right, conducting private diplomatic correspondence with, for example, the Egyptian Pharaoh, fostering the children of nobles, and arranging for diplomatic marriages. Significantly too, Puduhepa seems to have initiated a revival of Kizzuwatnan religious practice in the capital city. We know from other documents that she ordered the chief scribe to have recopied earlier religious rituals, presumably those collected from Kizzuwatnan sources during the Middle Kingdom period. The marriage and start of Hattusilis's family occurred before Hattusilis became king. Instead of inheriting the kingship directly, Hattusilis seized it by force. When Muwattallis, the brother of Hattusilis, died, he apparently left no male heirs of the "first rank" (sons of his primary wife). Following the rules of succession laid down by Telepenus, a son of the "second rank", Urhi-Teshup, who took the throne name Mursilis upon assuming the kingship. Hattusilis remained a powerful figure in the court, however. His success as a military commander and administrator seems to have provoked resentment within court circles, and at one point the "apology" relates how he was falsely accused of malfeasance but, with the divine protection of Ishtar, acquitted. Although he initially supported his nephew the king, he later deposed him, once again claiming the divine guidance and support of Ishtar as his authority.

Translation
2 I will tell of Ishtar's divine power; let mankind hear it. And, from henceforth, among the gods of my majesty, of his son, of his grandson, of the descendants of my majesty, let there be reverence toward Ishtar.
3 My father, Mursilis, begat us four children, Halpasulupis, Muwattallis, Hattusilis and Massanauzzis, a daughter. And of all of them, I was the last (i.e. the youngest) child. And while I was still a child, I was foolish. Ishtar, My Lady, sent my brother Muwattalis to my father Mursilis in (i.e. by means of) a dream, (saying) "For Hattusilis, the years are short. He will not live long. Give him to me and let him be my priest. Then he will live." And my father offered me, a child, and he gave me to the service of the deity. And serving as a priest to the deity, I made sacrifice. And in the hand of Ishtar, My lady, I saw prosperity(?). And Ishtar, My Lady, took me by the hand, and she showed me divine guidance.
9 When, however, I came back from the land of Egypt, I went to the city of Lawanzantiyas to make libations to the Goddess; and I made sacrifice to the Goddess. And, at the command of the Goddess, I took Puduhepa, the daughter of Pentipsarris, the priest, in marriage; and we married. And the Goddess gave to us the love of husband and wife. And we had (lit. "made") sons and daughters. And the Goddess, my lady, appeared to me in a dream (saying), "Serve me along with your household." And I did service to the Goddess, along with my household. And the Goddess stood among us (in) the household that we established, and our household prospered(?), and it had the favor of My Lady, Ishtar.
Grammar
26 The Ablative.
As in Greek and Sanskrit, the ablative is the case that denotes separation or origin: it is often used to indicate motion away from a location. For example:

 	 	DSIN-as-wa-kan	 	nepisaz	 	mausta
 	 	moon-it-quotative-locatival	 	from heaven (abl.)	 	fell
 	 	"The moon, it fell from heaven."
 	 	karizz-a-kan	 	GIM-an	 	URU-az	 	sēhur	 	IM-an	 	ārri
 	 	flood-and-locatival	 	as	 	from the city (abl.)	 	filth	 	mud	 	washes
 	 	"As the flood washes filth (and) mud from the city..."
 	 	arunaz	 	ehu
 	 	from the sea (abl)	 	come
 	 	"From the sea, come!"
26.1 Motion away
In the following passage from the "Proclamation of Anittas," the city names Nēsaz and Zālpuwaz in the ablative indicate motion away from a place and are opposed to the allatives Zālpuwa and Nēsa, which indicate motion towards a place:

 	 	karū	 	MŪhnas	 	LUGAL	 	URUZālpuwa
 	 	previously	 	Uhna	 	king	 	of Zalpa
 	 	DSiusummin	 	URUNēsaz	 	URUZālpuwa	 	pēdas
 	 	Siusummi	 	from Neza (abl.)	 	to Zalpa (all.)	 	had carried
 	 	appezziyan-a	 	MAnittas	 	LUGAL.GAL	 	DSiusummin
 	 	later-but	 	Anittas	 	Great King	 	Siusummi
 	 	URUZālpuwaz	 	āppa	 	URUNēsa	 	pēdahhun
 	 	from Zalpa (abl.)	 	back	 	to Nesa (all.)	 	I carried
 	 	"Previously, Uhna, King of Zalpuwa, had carried Siusummi from Nesa to Zalpuwa. But later, (I), Anitta, the Great King, carried Siusummi back from Zalpuwa to Nesa."
26.2 Without verbs of motion
In sentences without verbs of motion, nouns in the ablative may often be translated by English prepositional phrases with "from":

 	 	takku	 	amiyaraza	 	GIŠINBAM	 	kuiski	 	ārgi
 	 	if	 	from an irrigation ditch (abl.)	 	fruit trees	 	someone	 	cuts off
 	 	"If someone cuts fruit trees off from an irrigation ditch..."
 	 	ammuk-ma-aza	 	ŠÀ-az	 	lahlahhiman	 	ŪL	 	tarhmi
 	 	I-but-reflexive	 	from heart (abl.)	 	worry	 	not	 	overcome
 	 	"But I cannot overcome the worry from (my) heart."
26.3 Consequence
The ablative may also have the sense "as the result of":

 	 	takku	 	LÚ-an	 	nasma	 	MUNUS-an	 	sullanaz	 	kuiski	 	kuenzi
 	 	if	 	man	 	or	 	woman	 	quarrel (abl.)	 	someone	 	kills
 	 	"If someone kills a man or a woman as the result of a quarrel."
26.4 Akkadian IŠTU
The Akkadian preposition IŠTU often accompanies a noun in the ablative case. The following passage from the ritual of Tunnawi uses both Akkadograms with phonetic complements spelled -az to mark nouns as ablative and Akkadian IŠTU:

 	 	zik-kan	 	mahhan	 	sakunis	 	GE6-az (abl.)	 	KI-az (abl.)
 	 	you-locatival	 	just as	 	spring	 	dark-from	 	earth-from
 	 	purut	 	EGIR	 	sarā sakuneskesi	 	 	 	 
 	 	mud	 	back	 	keeps bubbling up	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	edani	 	antuhsi	 	ANA	 	EN.SISKUR
 	 	and	 	for this	 	for person	 	for	 	patient
 	 	IŠTU	 	UZUÚRHI.A-ŠU	 	idalu	 	papratar	 	 
 	 	(from)	 	from limbs (abl)-his	 	evil	 	impurity	 	 
 	 	QA-TAM-MA	 	mutāi	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	just so	 	remove	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as you, spring, keep gushing up mud from the dark world, just so, from the limbs of this person, the patient, remove evil impurity!"
26.5 Postpositions
The ablative is used with some postpositions, and again, the sense is one of separation or distance. For example, with katta, kattan "down" the sense is "down from":

 	 	DUTU-us-kan	 	nepisaza	 	katta	 	sakuwayat
 	 	The Sungod-locatival	 	from heaven (abl.)	 	down	 	looked
 	 	"The Sungod looked down from heaven."
26.6 Spatial relations
Some adverbs indicating spatial relations are made from the ablative case forms of pronouns, for example apēz "from there" and kēz "from here" (from the ablatives of apā- "that" and kā- "this"). Others may be made from the ablatives of nouns or adjectives.

 	 	kūnnaz-tit	 	iyatta
 	 	on right (abl.)-your	 	walks
 	 	"He walks on your right."
(from kūnna- 'right')

 	 	iskisaz	 	EGIR-pa	 	iyattāri
 	 	backwards (abl.)	 	back	 	he walks
 	 	"He retreats backwards."
(from iskis- 'back')

 	 	ANA	 	LÚSANGA-as	 	DU	 	GÙB-laza
 	 	to	 	the priest	 	of the Stormgod	 	on the left (abl.)
 	 	iyatta	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	she walks	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"She walks to the left of the priest of the Stormgod."
(from GUB-la- 'left' -- Sumerogram, Hittite reading unkown)

26.7 With parkui-
The ablative may also be used with the adjective parkui- "pure," "free of impurities" in the sense "free of something" (usually something undesirable):

 	 	nu-za	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	idālawaz	 	uddanaz	 	 
 	 	and-reflexive	 	gods	 	evil (abl.)	 	words (abl.)	 	 
 	 	linkiyaz	 	hūrdiyaz	 	ēshanaz	 	isgaruwaz	 	hūmandazzi-ya
 	 	oath (abl.)	 	curse (abl.)	 	murder (abl.)	 	tears (abl.)	 	from all (abl.)-and
 	 	parkuwaēs	 	ēsten	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	free	 	let you be	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"May you, O gods, be free of evil words, perjury, curse, murder, tears, and of all (similar things)."
27 nt-stem Adjectives and Nouns
The suffix -nt- is fairly common in Hittite. Forms made with this suffix include adjectives (e.g., hūman- 'all'), participles (e.g., asānt- participle of ēs-, as- 'be' or tarant- participle of tē-, tar- 'say'), including participles used nominally (e.g., appānza 'captive' from appant-, participle of ēpp-, app- 'seize', or iyant- 'sheep', originally the participle of i-, midd. iya- 'go'), and some nouns including, for example, gimmant- 'winter' or ispant- 'night'. Adjectives with the suffix -went-, (e.g., kisduwant- 'hungry' beside kāsza, kest- 'hunger') are also nt-stems, as is the ergative suffix (nominative singular -anza, nominative plural -antes).

By regular sound change, the stem-final -t is lost in the nominative-accusative singular neuter (e.g., hūman from *hūmant). In the nominative singular animate, the combination of the stem-final -t and the nominative ending -s is spelled -za.

The adjective hūmant- 'all' is widely attested, and its paradigm may be taken as representative of the inflection of -nt-stems:

 	 	Singular	 	 	 	Plural
nom.anim.	 	hūman-za	 	 	 	hūmant-es
acc.anim.	 	hūmand-an	 	 	 	hūmand-us
nom.-acc.n.	 	hūman	 	 	 	hūmant-a
gen.	 	hūmant-as	 	 	 	hūmand-an, hūmand-as
dat./loc.	 	hūmant-i	 	 	 	hūmand-as
inst.	 	hūmant-et	 	 	 	 
abl.	 	hūmant-aza, hūmand-az	 	 	 	hūmanda-za
28 Derived Verbs
The verbal suffixes -nu-, -ēss-, and -ahh- play an important role in Hittite word formation, making verbs derived from verbal roots, from adjectives, and from nouns. The suffix -nu-, which can be added to verbal, nominal, or adjectival stems, is causative in value; in other words, it adds the sense "make someone do the action of a verb," or "make someone or something take on the qualities expressed by an adjective or noun." The suffix -ahh- is added to adjectives. Its sense is similar to that of -nu- in that it means "make someone or something take on the qualities expressed by the base adjective." The suffix -ēss-, which was originally primarily attached to adjectives, denotes entry into a state. Its sense is "become the quality expressed by the adjective."

28.1 Causatives in -nu-
Verbs with the suffix -nu- take mi-conjugation endings. Since an earlier sequence of *uw became um in Hittite, the first person plural present and preterit mi-conjugation endings -weni and -wen show up as -meni (or -mmeni) and -men after the suffix -nu-. It should be noted that the common spelling with uw in the third person plural present and imperative indicates that the final u of the suffix became w before the endings -anzi and -andu. The verb wahnu- 'make turn, swing' is related to wēh- 'turn', and parkunu- 'cleanse, purify' is from the adjective parkui- 'clean, pure'. The final i of the adjective is regularly dropped with the addition of the suffix:

Present	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	 	 	 
1	 	wah-nu-mi	 	parku-nu-mi
2	 	wah-nu-si	 	parku-nu-si
3	 	wah-nu-zzi	 	parku-nu-zzi
Plural	 	 	 	 
1	 	wah-nu-meni	 	parku-nu-mmeni
2	 	wah-nu-tteni	 	parku-nu-tteni
3	 	wah-nuw-anzi	 	parku-nuw-anzi
Preterit	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	 	 	 
1	 	wah-nu-nun	 	parku-nu-nun
2	 	 	 	*parku-nu-tten
3	 	wah-nu-t	 	parku-nu-t
Plural	 	 	 	 
1	 	wah-nu-men	 	parku-nu-men
2	 	*wah-nu-tten	 	*parku-nu-tten
3	 	wah-nu-er	 	parku-nu-er
Imperative	 	 	 	 
Singular	 	 	 	 
1	 	 	 	 
2	 	*wah-nu-t	 	parku-nu-t
3	 	*wah-nu-ttu	 	parku-nu-ddu
Plural	 	 	 	 
1	 	 	 	 
2	 	*wah-nu-tten	 	parku-nu-tten
3	 	*wah-nuw-andu	 	parku-nuw-andu
The verb in -nu- may have meanings quite close to those of the verb or adjective from which it is formed, or it may develop extended meanings not paralleled by its base. The adjective salli- means "big", and the derivative in -nu-, sallanu-, literally "make big," can mean "raise (children)." For example, this passage from the bronze tablet on which a treaty between the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV and Kurunta of Tarhuntassa is recorded uses the verb in this sense in both the infinitive and in the iterative:

 	 	annisan-pat-an	 	MNIR.GÁL-is	 	LUGAL-us	 	ANA	 	ABU-YA	 	 
 	 	before-emphatic-him	 	Muwattallis	 	the king	 	to	 	father-my	 	 
 	 	MHattusili	 	sallanummanzi	 	piyan	 	harta	 	n-an	 	annisan-pat
 	 	Hattusilis	 	to raise	 	given	 	had	 	and-him	 	already-indeed
 	 	ABU-YA	 	sallanusket	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	father-my	 	raised	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Previously Muwattalli, the king, had given him to my father, Hattusilis, to raise, and indeed, my father had already raised him."
The basic meaning of the adjective parkui- is "pure," "free from" (impurities), (physically or ritually) "clean"; it can also mean "innocent" in a legal context. The derived verb parkunu- has the literal meaning "clean, purify," and it can mean "declare (someone) innocent", "clarify (a matter), "reform" (cf. English "clean up" in the meaning "reform"), for example:

 	 	TÚGNÍG.LÁMMEŠ-kan	 	kēzza	 	arranzi
 	 	festival-clothes-locatival	 	with this	 	they wash
 	 	n-at	 	parkunuwanzi	 	 
 	 	and-them	 	they clean	 	 
 	 	"And they wash festive garments with this and clean them."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	kūn	 	EN.SISKUR	 	apēz	 	sapiya
 	 	and	 	this	 	patient	 	with it	 	scrub
 	 	n-an	 	12	 	UZUÚR	 	parkunut	 	 
 	 	and-him	 	twelve	 	body part(s)	 	purify	 	 
 	 	"Scrub this patient with it and purify the twelve parts of (his) body."
The verb weh- means "turn," and it is often used in the middle in the sense "go about," mill around," as in the following:

 	 	nu-ssi	 	peran	 	hūmantes	 	parkunwantes	 	wehanta
 	 	and-him	 	before	 	all	 	purified	 	they go about
 	 	"And all go about before him in a purified state."
The derivative wahnu-, however, means "make turn" and may have metaphorical meanings such as "alter."

 	 	n-an-kan	 	ŪL-pat	 	wahnunun
 	 	and-it-locatival	 	not-certainly	 	I turned
 	 	"And certainly I did not alter it (a tablet)."
With the preverb sēr "above" wahnu- can mean "wave (something) over" (someone or something):

 	 	ug-a-smas-san	 	ERÍNMEŠ-an	 	sēr	 	3	 	ŠU	 	wahnumi
 	 	I-but-them-locatival	 	soldiers	 	over	 	three	 	times	 	I make turn
 	 	"I wave the (clay statues of the) soldiers over them three times."
The mi-verb link- means "swear an oath," but the derivative linganu- means "make swear an oath," or "put under oath":

 	 	n-as	 	linganunun	 	nu-tta
 	 	and-them	 	I have put under oath	 	and-to you
 	 	memian	 	sakuwasar	 	memandu
 	 	word	 	truthfully	 	let them speak
 	 	"I have put them under oath; let them tell you the truth."
28.2 Factitive verbs in -ahh-
Both mi-conjugation and hi-conjugation inflection is attested for verbs with the suffix -ahh-. Although the base from which maniyahh- 'distribute, entrust, administer, govern' has been formed has been lost, it is a well attested verb, and many of its inflected forms have been found:

Singular	 	 
Present	 	 
1.	 	maniy-ah-mi
2.	 	maniy-ah-ti
3.	 	maniy-ah-zi, maniy-ahh-i
Plural	 	 
1.	 	*maniy-ah-weni
2.	 	*maniy-ah-teni
3.	 	*maniy-ahh-anzi
Preterit	 	 
Singular	 	 
1.	 	maniy-ahh-un
2	 	maniy-ah-ta
3.	 	maniy-ahh-is, maniy-ah-ta
Plural	 	 
1.	 	*maniy-ahh-wen
2.	 	*maniy-ahh-ten
3.	 	maniy-ahh-ir
Imperative	 	 
Singular	 	 
2.	 	maniy-ah
3.	 	maniy-ah-du
Plural	 	 
2.	 	maniy-ah-ten
3.	 	*maniy-ahh-andu
The effect of the suffix is to produce a verb that means make someone or something have the quality expressed by the adjective from which the verb is derived. One finds, for example, happinahh- 'make rich, enrich' beside happina- 'rich', dasawahh- 'make blind, blind' from dasuwant- 'blind', or newahh- 'make new, re-copy' beside nēwa- 'new'. The following two sentences provide examples:

 	 	mān	 	ŪL-ma	 	nu-smas-san	 	uwanzi
 	 	if	 	not-but	 	then-to-you-locatival	 	they come
 	 	apiya	 	pēdi	 	tasuwahhanzi	 	 
 	 	there	 	in the place	 	they make blind	 	 
 	 	"If you don't (obey the king's orders), then they will come to you and will blind (you) on the spot."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at	 	luluwāi	 	happinahhi-ya-at
 	 	and-it	 	sustain	 	make rich-and-it
 	 	"Sustain it (the country of Hatti), and enrich it"
28.3 Mi-conjugation verbs in -ēss-
The central meaning of the mi-conjugation verbs in ēss- is to become the possessor of the quality that the base adjective expresses. It should be noted that the archaic pattern for forming such verbs is to drop the suffix that characterizes the adjective. So, for example, ekuness- 'become cold' comes from the a-stem adjective ekuna- 'cold', tepauēss- 'become small, become short' is ultimately from tēpu- 'small, short', militēss- 'become sweet' is from miliddu- 'sweet', salless- 'grow, become big' is from salli- 'big', dalukēss- 'become long' is from daluki- 'long', dankuēss- 'become dark' is from dankui- 'dark', and innarawess- 'become strong' is from innarawant- 'strong'. The suffix has the shape -ēs- before consonants (e.g., tēpawēsta 'it became short') and -ēss- before vowels (e.g., idālauwessanzi 'they became evil'). The following are examples of how verbs in -ēss- are used.

In this passage from the "Annals of Mursilis" the participle of tēpāwēss- is used with ēs- 'be'. The expression "the year had become short" means that fall had come and with it the end of the season during which the king waged war.

 	 	nu-mu	 	MU.KAM-za	 	kuit	 	sēr tēpawēssanza ēsta
 	 	and-to-me	 	year	 	because	 	had become short
 	 	"And because the year had become short on me, ..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	GIŠPEŠ	 	mahhan	 	miliddu	 	ANA	 	DIM
 	 	fig	 	as	 	sweet	 	to	 	Stormgod
 	 	URUKuliwisna	 	ZITUM	 	anda	 	QĀTAMMA	 	militisdu
 	 	city of Kuliwisna	 	mood	 	into	 	likewise	 	sweeten
 	 	"As the fig is sweet, let the mood of the Stormgod of Kuliwisna likewise become sweet."
28.4 Variable meaning
The following phrases, which use verb forms with different suffixes side-by-side, illustrate how the meanings of these suffixes differ.

This phrase has parkunu- 'make clean' beside harkēss- 'become white' as the result of being cleaned (from harki- 'white'):

 	 	kās-wa	 	GIM-an	 	hās	 	GADHI.A	 	iskunanta	 	parkunuzzi
 	 	look-quotative	 	just as	 	soap	 	linens	 	dirty	 	makes clean
 	 	nu-war-at	 	harkēzi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	so-quotative-they	 	become white ...	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as this soap cleans dirty linens (so that) they become white..."
This phrase is very similar to the one above, except that it uses harganu- 'make white' in place of harkēss- 'become white':

 	 	n-at	 	GIM-an	 	kās	 	hassas	 	parkunut-at	 	harganut
 	 	and-it	 	just as	 	this	 	soap	 	cleaned-it	 	made white
 	 	"Just as this soap has cleaned it (and) made (it) white..."
In this sentence, which is about someone who has been accused of a crime and sentenced to trial by ordeal to determine guilt or innocence, parkuēss- 'be proven innocent' (lit. 'become pure') contrasts with parkunu- 'make clean' in a metaphorical sense:

 	 	mān-as	 	parkuēszi	 	nu-za	 	ZI-ŠU	 	parkunuddu
 	 	if-he	 	becomes pure	 	and-reflexive	 	mind-his	 	make clean
 	 	"If he is proven innocent, let him consider himself exonerated. (lit. 'let him cleanse his own mind', with the reflexive particle -za)"
The sentence below discusses the defilement of items in a temple. It contrasts the participle of marsanu- 'desecrate' from marsa- 'false, defiled' with āppa suppiyahh- 'make pure again', with suppiyahh- 'make holy' from suppi- 'pure, holy':

 	 	mānn-a	 	marsanuwan	 	kuitki	 	n-at	 	sekkanzi	 	mahhan	 	n-at
 	 	if-and	 	desecrated	 	something	 	and-it	 	they know	 	as	 	and-it
 	 	QĀTAMMA	 	EGIR-pa suppiyahhanzi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	just-as	 	again-make holy	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"And if something is desecrated, they will reconsecrate it in the way that they know."
29 The participle
The Hittite participle in -ant- is from an Indo-European active participle. It is inflected as an nt-stem. In most instances, any distinction in voice shown by the participle depends on whether the verb from which it is derived is transitive or intransitive. Normally, participles from transitive verbs, that is verbs that may take direct objects, are passive in sense (e.g., appānt- 'captured', nominal 'captive' from ēpp-, app- 'seize'; piyant- 'given' from pāi- 'give'; or sekkant- 'known' from sākk-, sekk- 'know'). Participles from intransitive verbs, that is, verbs that do not take direct objects, are active and intransitive by contrast (e.g., pānt- 'gone' from pāi- 'go' or maussant- 'fallen' from mū-, mauss- 'fall'). Two exceptions to this pattern are adānt-, participle of ēd- 'eat', which is found in the sense "eaten" and akuwānt-, participle of eku-, aku- 'drink', which occurs in the sense "drunk."

29.1 Verbal adjective
The participle may be used as a verbal adjective (compare, e.g., English "melted butter"):

 	 	1	 	UDU	 	huwiswandan	 	appanzi
 	 	one	 	sheep	 	living	 	they take
 	 	"They take one live sheep."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	GIŠBANHI.A-a-ssan	 	kuyēs	 	huettiyanta	 	GIŠKAK.Ú.TAG.GAHI.A-ya
 	 	bows-but-locatival	 	who	 	drawn	 	arrows-and
 	 	harkanzi	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	they hold	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"But those who hold drawn bows and arrows ..."
In some instances, participles that modify nouns seem to have lost, or at least loosened their connections to living verbs (compare, e.g., English "molten lava" with "molten," from an archaic participle of "melt"). For example, enant-, which means something like "tamed" or "trained" in the phrase MÁŠ.GAL enanza 'tamed he-goat', is probably the participle of an otherwise unattested verb inu-. Although the verb ārr- 'wash' is well attested, the participle arrant- seems to be used as an adjective in phrases like arranza halkis 'washed grain' or ŠE arran 'washed barley'. Similarly, an adjectival liliwant- 'swift, urgent' apparently comes from the participle of liliwahh- 'hasten, hurry':

 	 	NIM.LÀL	 	liliwandan	 	piēt
 	 	bee	 	swift	 	he sent
 	 	"He sent the swift bee."
29.2 Transitive verbs
Participles of transitive verbs are used with forms of ēs- 'be' in a construction that may be translated by an English passive.

 	 	hurtantes	 	eser
 	 	cursed	 	they were
 	 	"They were cursed."
(with hurtant-, participle of huwart- 'curse')

 	 	nu	 	LÚMEŠ	 	URUHatti	 	kuit	 	LÚMEŠ	 	URUMizri
 	 	and	 	people	 	of Hatti	 	because	 	people	 	of Egypt
 	 	IŠTU	 	DIM	 	URUHatti	 	linganuwantes	 	eser	 	 
 	 	by	 	Stormgod	 	of Hatti	 	placed under oath	 	they were	 	 
 	 	"And the people of Hatti and the people of Egypt, because they had been placed under oath by the Stormgod of Hatti"
(with linganuwant-, participle of linganu- 'place under oath')

This construction also occurs in nominal sentences, in which a present form of "to be" is to be understood:

 	 	KASKAL-us-mu	 	kuis	 	huettiyanza
 	 	path-the-for-me	 	that	 	is drawn
 	 	"The path that is drawn for me..."
(with huettiyant-, participle of huettiya- 'draw, drag')

29.3 Intransitive verbs
Participles of intransitive verbs are used with finite forms of ēs- 'be' in a construction that may be translated by an English active perfect. The sense remains intransitive:

 	 	antuhsatar	 	pān	 	esta
 	 	population	 	gone	 	was
 	 	"The population had gone."
(with pānt- participle of pāi- 'go')

 	 	kuis-wa-mu-kan kuis	 	parranda	 	uwanza
 	 	who-quotative-to me-locatival-who	 	over	 	has come
 	 	"Whoever has come over to me..."
(with uwant-, participle of uwa- 'come')

 	 	nu-ssan	 	mān	 	halkiēs	 	arantes	 	n-as-kan	 	arha warastin
 	 	and-locatival	 	when	 	grain	 	ripened	 	and-it-locatival	 	harvest up
 	 	"When the grain has ripened (lit. 'is standing'), harvest it up."
(with arant-, participle of ar- 'stand')

29.4 Other uses of participles.
The participle is occasionally used in a semi-adverbial sense:

 	 	DIM-as	 	lēlaniyanza	 	wezzi
 	 	The Stormgod	 	furious	 	he came
 	 	"Furious, the Stormgod came."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-as	 	arrandas	 	tūriyanzi
 	 	and-them	 	washed	 	they harness
 	 	"After they (horses) are washed, they harness them."
 	 	"(The horses) having been washed, they harness them."
The participle asant- of ēs- 'be' can have the meaning "true" (literally "as it is"):

 	 	asanza	 	LUGAL-us
 	 	true	 	king
 	 	"the true king"
Occasonally participles may be nominalized; that is, used in noun functions. For example, in this phrase, aniyant- the participle of aniya- 'do, make, perform' in the nominative-accusative neuter is used in the sense "work":

 	 	UD.KAM-as	 	aniyan	 	kuis	 	essai
 	 	day's	 	work	 	who	 	performs
 	 	"Who performs a day's work ..."
Similarly, appānt- and kunānt-, the participles of ēpp- 'capture' and kuen- 'strike, kill' can be used as nouns meaning "a captive" or "the dead."

The participle of a transitive verb, when used with forms of hark- 'have, hold', can have the sense "be kept" in the condition specified by the participle.

 	 	nu-mu	 	munnan	 	harta
 	 	and-me	 	hidden	 	he had kept
 	 	"He had kept me hidden."
30 Conditional and Comparative Clauses
Conditional clauses, normally to be translated in English by clauses with "if," may take a number of forms in Hittite. To express factual conditions, two conjunctions meaning "if," takku and mān, are used. Mān is also used in contrary to fact (unreal conditions), and, in the meaning "when" to introduce time clauses. It may also be used as a conjunction meaning "whether." Since the meanings "if" and "when" are close, context determines whether a clause with mān is to be translated as conditional or temporal. Comparative clauses, or clauses in which a thing or an action is likened to another, are fairly frequent in Hittite. Comparative clauses use the subordinating conjunctions mān, māhhan, and mahhanda, each of which can mean "as" or "just as".

30.1 Conditional Clauses
The conjunction takku is found only in early texts and in later copies of early texts. It is very common in the law code, which may be viewed as a series of statements about the consequences of actions.

 	 	takku	 	LÚDAM.GÀR	 	kuiski	 	kwēnzi	 	1 ME	 	MANA
 	 	if	 	merchant	 	someone	 	kills	 	one hundred	 	shekels
 	 	KÙ.BABBAR	 	pāi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	silver	 	he gives	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"If someone kills a merchant, he gives (in compensation) one hundred shekels of silver."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	LÚ.U19.LU-as	 	SÀG.DU-ZU	 	kuiski	 	hūnikzi
 	 	if	 	person's	 	head-his	 	someone	 	injures
 	 	karū	 	6	 	GÍN	 	KÙ.BABBAR	 	pisker
 	 	previously	 	six	 	shekels	 	silver	 	they used to give
 	 	"If someone injures a person's head, previously six shekels of silver were given."
The conjunction mān in the meaning "if" is found in texts from the earliest period onward. It may also be used in indirect questions. The first sentence below is from the "Proclamation of Telepenus":

 	 	kinuna	 	mān	 	DUMU.LUGAL	 	kuiski	 	wastai	 	nu	 	SAG.DU-az-pat
 	 	but now	 	if	 	prince	 	any	 	sins	 	then	 	with head-his own
 	 	sarnikdu	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	let him atone	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"But now, if any prince sins, then let him atone with his own head."
This sentence, from a ritual text, sets different conditions for treating men and women:

 	 	nu	 	EN.SISKUR.SISKUR	 	mān	 	LÚ	 	 
 	 	and	 	patient	 	if	 	man	 	 
 	 	n-as-zan	 	ŠA	 	DIM	 	GIŠŠÚ.A	 	esari
 	 	and-he-locatival	 	of	 	Teshup	 	chair	 	he sits
 	 	mān-as	 	MUNUS-ma	 	n-as-zan	 	ŠA	 	DHebat
 	 	if-she	 	woman-but	 	and-she-locatival	 	of	 	Hebat
 	 	ANA	 	GIŠGÌR,GUB	 	esari	 	 	 	 
 	 	on	 	footstool	 	sits	 	 	 	 
 	 	"If the patient (treated in a ritual) is a man, he sits down on the chair of Teshup; but if the patient is a woman, she sits on the stool of Hebat."
Conditional clauses with mān are often used in the openings of rituals to indicate the ritual's purpose.

 	 	mān	 	antuwahhas	 	alwanzahhanza	 	n-an	 	kissan	 	aniyami
 	 	if	 	person	 	bewitched	 	and-him	 	thus	 	I treat
 	 	"If a person has been bewitched, I treat him as follows."
Mān may be used in indirect questions in the sense "if" or "whether":

 	 	mān-mu-kan	 	annaz-ma	 	kartaz	 	kī	 	gulsta
 	 	if-to me-locatival	 	from mother-reflexive	 	from womb	 	this	 	inscribed
 	 	ug-at-za	 	āppan	 	MUNUSENSI-ta	 	natta	 	kussanka
 	 	I-it-reflexive	 	after	 	female dream interpreter	 	not	 	even
 	 	punussan	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	I asked	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"I never even inquired of a female dream interpreter if (or 'whether') this (illness) was ordained for me from my mother's womb."
The conjunction kuit, 'because' joins independent clauses, expressing a logical relationship between a main clause and a qualifying clause that provides the reasons for actions or occurrences. It is placed neither at the head of the sentence nor at the head of the qualifying clause. Instead, it normally follows full phrase of the clause. The effect of this placement may be to focus attention on the immediate reason for the actions taken in the result clause. For example, kuit often follows the subject of the sentence, the agent leading to the action.

 	 	nu-mu	 	MU.KAM-za	 	kuit	 	sēr tēpauēssanza ēsta	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-for-me	 	the year	 	because	 	had become short	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	nam-ma	 	KUR	 	URUAzzi	 	Ú-UL	 	daninunuun
 	 	and	 	moreover	 	the land	 	of Azzi	 	not	 	garrisoned
 	 	"And because the year had become short on me, I did not garrison the land of Azzi."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	LÚ.ME^S	 	URUNuhasiwa	 	kuit	 	kūruriyahhir
 	 	people	 	Nuhasiya	 	because	 	have become hostile
 	 	nu-war-as	 	arha harnik	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-quotative-them	 	destroy utterly	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Because the people of Huhasiya have commenced hostilities, destroy them utterly!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mahhan-ma	 	hameshanza	 	kisat	 	 
 	 	when-but	 	spring	 	became	 	 
 	 	nu	 	MUhha.LÚ-is	 	kuit	 	GIG-at
 	 	and	 	Uhhaziti	 	because	 	had taken sick
 	 	n-as-kan	 	aruni	 	ēsta	 	 
 	 	and-he-locatival	 	in sea	 	was	 	 
 	 	"But when it became spring, because Uhhaziti had taken sick, he was in the sea (i.e. 'on an island')."
In this sentence, kuit follows ŠŪRIPU 'cold', the reason for the king's retreat to the river Astarpa:

 	 	ŠŪRIPU	 	kuit	 	karū	 	kisat	 	 
 	 	cold	 	because	 	already	 	became	 	 
 	 	namma	 	EGIR-pa	 	INA	 	ÍDAstarpa	 	uwanun
 	 	moreover	 	back	 	to	 	river Astarpa	 	I went
 	 	"Because it had already become cold, I went back to the river Astarpa."
30.2 Comparative Clauses
Comparative clauses are especially common in ritual texts in descriptions of ritual actions in which a thing is endowed with the baneful qualities that the ritual practitioner is removing from the patient. In these rituals, the practitioner likens the object to something harmful and performs ritual actions upon it or likens an action to removing harm from the patient. Alternatively, the practioner may use a comparison to a desirable state to wish something good for the patient. Comparative clauses are often complemented by clauses using the correlative adverb apenissan (or the Akkadogram QĀTAMMA) meaning "(just) so" or "likewise."

Mān, which has a number of functions, including use as a postposition meaning "like," may be used as a conjunction meaning "just as" in comparative clauses. It is found within the clause and not initially:

 	 	kās	 	LÚ.U19.LU-as	 	mān	 	karū	 	n-as	 	EGIR-pa	 	apenissan
 	 	this	 	person	 	just as	 	before	 	and-he	 	again	 	just so
 	 	ēstu	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	be (let him be)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as this person was before, may he be just so again."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	DUTU-us	 	DIM-as	 	mān	 	uktūres
 	 	Sungod	 	Stormgod	 	just as	 	eternal
 	 	LUGAL-us	 	MUNUS.LUGAL-ass-a	 	QĀTAMMA	 	uktūres
 	 	king	 	queen-and	 	likewise	 	eternal
 	 	asantu	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	let them be	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as the Sungod (and) the Stormgod are eternal, so, likewise let the king and queen be eternal."
Māhhan is more commonly used as a subordinating conjunction meaning "like," "as," or "just as." The following sentence, which is much like the sentence with mān above, suggests that it could be essentially a synonym of mān in this sense:

 	 	kī	 	NA4pēru	 	māhhan	 	uktūri	 	 
 	 	this	 	boulder	 	just as	 	eternal	 	 
 	 	BĒLU	 	Ù	 	DAM-ŠU	 	DUMUMEŠ-ŠU	 	QĀTAMMA
 	 	lord	 	and	 	wife-his	 	children-his	 	likewise
 	 	uktūres	 	asantu	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	eternal	 	let them be	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as this boulder is eternal, let the lord (i.e. the king), his wife, and his children be eternal."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mahhan-wa-tta	 	āssu	 	nu-wa	 	QĀTAMMA	 	iya
 	 	as-quotative-to-you	 	good	 	and-quotative	 	likewise	 	do
 	 	"Do as seems good to you."
The comparative clause may be complemented by a clause that lacks a correlative adverb:

 	 	nu	 	sankus	 	alil	 	mahhan	 	nu-za	 	parkiyat
 	 	and	 	sankus	 	plant	 	just as	 	and-reflexive	 	grew
 	 	tuell-a	 	ŠA	 	DU	 	ZI-KA	 	parktaru	 	 
 	 	your-and	 	of	 	Stormgod	 	soul-your	 	let it grow	 	 
 	 	"Just as the sankus flower grew, may your soul, O Stormgod, grow."
The subordinating conjuncttion māhhanda (also written mānhhanda and mān handa) seems to be exclusively used in comparative clauses. It is presumably a compound of mān and the adverb handa 'facing' in origin. The evidence is unclear, but it may be an archaism confined to early texts and copies of these texts. The following is from a text written by an Old Kingdom prince, perhaps Mursilis I, to his noblemen:

 	 	mān-smas	 	ABI	 	parnas-ma	 	tarna	 	 
 	 	when-you	 	father	 	to houses-but	 	lets go	 	 
 	 	nu-smas	 	mānhhanda	 	hatreskezzi	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-to-you	 	just as	 	he writes	 	 	 	 
 	 	natta-smas	 	LÚ.ME^SDUGUD-as	 	tuppi	 	hazzian	 	harzi
 	 	not-for-you	 	dignitaries	 	tablet	 	written	 	has
 	 	"When (my) father lets you go to (your) houses, just as he customarily writes to you, has he not inscribed a tablet for you dignitaries?"

Lesson 7
Sara E. Kimball, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
The bronze tablet introduced here, containing the state treaty of Tuthalijas IV, circa 1260-1240 B.C., was found in Boğazköy in 1986. It provides an excellent example of such treaties as well as information on the state of the Hittite Empire at the time. After noting that his father, Hattušiliš III (circa 1283-1260 B.C.) had deposed Urhi-Teššup (circa 1285-1283), the son of Muwattalliš (circa 1313-1285), it absolves his second son, Kurunta, of any blame and permits him to maintain his position as king in the southern land of Tarhuntašša. In addition it goes on at length to specify the boundaries of that land in detail. The third paragraph here indicates that Tuthalijaš has continued the arrangement after the godhead accepted him and he became king. The find is especially interesting in that it states specifically that the tablet was produced for such a purpose.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Among the interests in the treaty is the basis for the favoring of Kurunta. As noted in the first paragraph presented here, Muwattališ had given Kurunta to Hattušiliš to raise. There may then have been a brotherly relation between him and Tuthalijaš. But while he maintains fraternal arrangements with Kurunta, Tuthalijaš states clearly in further sections of the treaty that he has authority over him so that he will protect him and his descendants in his small land, as will also the descendants of Tuthalija in the future. Moreover, Kurunta has limitations as well as responsibilities. Hattušiliš had deprived him of cavalry, so that in the future as well he will have only the obligation to provide foot soldiers for the king of Hatti is he is attacked or if he sets out to attack others; but will not be required to provide garrisons. That is to say, all the provisions that had been arranged previously will be maintained. In the concluding sections a long list of gods and goddesses is recorded as witnesses to the treaty. It is concluded with the statement that the scribe producing the tablet, Halwaziti, has written it for or in the presence of the son of the king as well as numerous other notable royals.

Translation
2 When my father, Hattusilis, revolted against Urhi-Tessup, son of Muwattallis and deposed him from kingship, no blame whatsoever attached to (lit. "remained with") Kuruntas. However the people of Hatti had been at fault, Kuruntas was in no way whatsoever (involved) in (the wrong side). Already before, the king, Muwattallis, had given him (Kuruntas) to Hattusilis to raise, and already before, my father (i.e. Hattusilis) had raised him. Previously, Muwattallis, the king, had handed him over to my father, Hattusilis, to raise, and my father had raised him.
3 But when my father deposed Urhi-Tessup from kingship, my father took Kuruntas and set him up in kingship in Tarhuntassas. The treaty that my father made for him -- how he set the boundaries for him -- my father made a treaty-tablet (concerning them); and Karunta possesses it. Moreover, the boundaries are laid out for him as follows: for you, from the town of Pitassas, the borders are: Mt. Hawas, the Kantana of Zarniyas, and the town of Sanantarwas. The Kantana of Zarniyas to the Hulaya river-land remain (as borders). And the town of Santanarwas to the town of Pitassas remain (as borders).
4 From the town of Pitassas, the town of Nahhantas was the border. And, on the treaty tablet of my father, the river source of Arimattas was made the border. But for now, for him (Kuruntas), My Majesty has reestablished the previous border. From the town of Pitassas, from the town of Arimattas, the town of Nahhantas (and) the town of Hautassa are the border. But Nahhantas and Hautassa to the Huliya river-land remain (the border).
15 But when my father died (lit. "became a god"), whichever lands had remained waiting (to attack) at that time, Kuruntas was prepared to die for me. He protected me, and he kept the oath which he had sworn and in no way did he turn aside (from his loyalty). But when the god took me, and I became king, then I made a treaty with Kuruntas as follows: those towns which were not placed on the treaty tablet of my father, those towns, along with field and meadow, (and) all deportees, I gave to Kuruntas (to hold) in vassalship. And whatever is within the Hulaya river-land, all (of it) remains for Kuruntas, king of Tarhuntassas (to hold) in vassalship. I have reestablished the borders well for him. I have returned the permanent rock sanctuary to him; and henceforth, let no one take away the permanent rock sanctuary from the descendants of Kuruntas.
Grammar
31 The Instrumental
The instrumental case indicates an object or material with which something is done or (semi-adverbially) the way in which something is accomplished. It may usually be translated in English by the prepositions "by," "with," or "by means of":

 	 	GÌR-it	 	sarā	 	pāun
 	 	by foot (inst.)	 	up	 	I went
 	 	"I went up by foot."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	SILÁ	 	wetenit	 	katta ānsanzi
 	 	and	 	lamb	 	with water (inst.)	 	down-wipe
 	 	"They wipe down a lamb with water."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	(D)IS^TAR	 	GAS^AN-YA	 	A-NA	 	(M)Mursli	 	A.BI-YA
 	 	and	 	Ishtar	 	lady-my	 	to	 	Mursilis	 	father-my
 	 	U\-et	 	(M)NIR.GA\L	 	S^ES^-YA	 	wiyat	 	 	 	 
 	 	with a dream (inst.)	 	Muwatallis	 	brother-my	 	sent	 	 	 	 
 	 	"And Ishtar, My lady, sent Muwattallis, my brother, to my father in (lit. 'by means of') a dream."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ta	 	kalulupu-smus	 	gāpinit	 	hul:liemi
 	 	and	 	fingers-their	 	with thread (inst.)	 	I wrap
 	 	"I wrap their fingers with thread."
31.1 Causation
The instrumental can be used to indicate the cause of some actions:

 	 	DUMU.LÚU19LURMEŠ	 	DINGIRMEŠ-s-a	 	kistanit	 	harkiyanzi
 	 	humans	 	gods-and	 	from hunger (inst.)	 	perish
 	 	"Humans and gods are perishing from hunger."
31.2 Containment
In English, we might speak of transporting a substance "in" a container. In Hittite, however, the container is often rendered in the instrumental case:

 	 	kīdanda	 	pattanit	 	ekan	 	utiskemi
 	 	this (inst.)	 	with bucket (inst.)	 	ice	 	I keep bringing
 	 	"I keep bringing ice with this bucket."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	2	 	DUMUMEŠ.É.GAL	 	ANA	 	LUGAL	 	MUNUS.LUGAL
 	 	and	 	two	 	sons of the palace	 	to	 	king	 	queen
 	 	MĒQATI	 	hūparit	 	GUŠKIN	 	pēdanzi	 	 	 	 
 	 	hand-water	 	with a bowl (inst.)	 	golden	 	offer	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Two sons of the palace offer the king (and) queen hand-water in (lit 'with') a bowl."
31.3 Verbs meaning "fill"
Verbs meaning "fill" take a noun in the instrumental. Compare English "filled with water":

 	 	anda-kan	 	halēnas	 	tessummius	 	tarlipit	 	sūwamus
 	 	in-locatival	 	of clay	 	cups	 	with tarlipta-drink (inst.)	 	filled
 	 	2-TAM	 	petumini	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	twice	 	we bring	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Twice, we bring in the cups of clay filled with tarlipta-drink."
31.4 Call by name
In the Hittite expression meaning "call by name," the word meaning "name" is in the instrumental:

 	 	n-asta	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	hūmandus	 	lamnit	 	halzai
 	 	and-locatival	 	gods	 	all	 	by name (inst.)	 	he calls
 	 	"And he calls all the gods by name."
31.5 Adverbs
Forms of the instrumental of some nouns are used adverbially to describe the manner in which action is performed.

 	 	ZI-it	 	menahhanta	 	lē	 	kuedani	 	iyasi
 	 	willfully (inst., lit. 'with soul')	 	towards	 	not	 	anyone	 	act
 	 	"Do not act willfully towards anyone."
The adverb pangarit 'in large numbers, in force' is probably from the instrumental of an otherwise lost noun *pangar- 'large number'. Compare the verb derived from this noun pangariya- 'become widespread':

 	 	nu-mu	 	LÚKÚRHI.A	 	ŠA	 	KUR	 	Alasiya	 	pangarit	 	zahhiya	 	wet
 	 	and-me	 	enemy	 	of	 	country	 	Alasiya	 	in force	 	for battle	 	came
 	 	"The Alasiyan enemy came against me in large numbers for battle."
The word nakkit 'by force' is from the instrumental of nakki- 'heavy, important'.

 	 	nu	 	URUNēsan	 	ispandi	 	nakkit	 	dās
 	 	and	 	Nesa	 	in the night	 	by force	 	I took
 	 	"And I took Nesa in the night by force."
31.6 Ablative
In texts written after the earliest period, the ablative gradually takes over the function of the instrumental:

 	 	URU-an	 	zahhiyaz	 	katta dahhun
 	 	the city	 	with battle	 	I conquered
 	 	"I conquered the city in (or 'with') a battle (abl.)."
32 T-Stem Nouns
Hittite nouns with stems in final -t- are normally animate, though, depending on meaning, they may make collective plurals. For example, the noun aniyatt- 'equipment' makes the plural aniyatta. Some nouns in stem-final -t seem to be archaic. However, there is also a class of abstract nouns in -att-, such as aniyatt- from aniya- 'work, do', made from verbal stems. The nominative singular, which is a combination of the stem-final -t plus the animate ending -s is spelled -za or -az. The paradigms of kutt- 'wall', kāst- 'hunger' and the abstract nahsaratt- 'fear' beside nahsariya- 'be afraid, become afraid' are illustrative:

Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	kūzza	 	 	 	kāsza	 	 	 	nahsaraz, nahsaraza
acc.	 	kutt-an	 	 	 	gāst-an	 	 	 	nahsaradd-an
gen.	 	kutt-as	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	*nahsaratt-as
dat./loc	 	kutt-i	 	 	 	kāst-i	 	 	 	nahsaratt-i
abl.	 	kutt-az	 	 	 	*kāst-az	 	 	 	nahsaratt-aza
inst.	 	 	 	 	 	kāst-it	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	kutt-es	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	nahsaratt-es
acc.	 	kudd-us	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	nahsarradd-us
gen.	 	*kutt-as	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	nahsaratt-as
dat./loc.	 	kutt-as	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	nahsaratt-as
33 Adverbial Temporal Clauses
Hittite makes adverbial subordinate clauses indicating the time when something happened using several different conjunctions. Since each of the conjunctions used also has non-temporal meanings, for example introducing conditional or comparative clauses, clauses indicating time are recognized in context. The conjunctions mān, māhhan, and kuwāpi are to be translated as 'when' or 'as soon as', but kuitman seems closer in meaning to English 'while' or 'until'. Mān and māhhan are usually first in their clauses, while the placement of kuwāpi seems somewhat more flexible.

33.1 Adverbial Clauses with mān 'when'
Adverbial time clauses with the conjunction mān are found in the earliest texts and in copies of early texts, suggesting both that mān is one of the earliest conjunctions used to introduce time clauses and that it fell out of use after the earliest period. The following is from the Old Hittite "Legend of the Queen of Kanesh."

 	 	mān	 	MUHI.A	 	istarna	 	pāer	 	 	 	 
 	 	when	 	years	 	meanwhile	 	went	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	MUNUS.LUGAL	 	namma	 	30	 	MUNUS.DUMU	 	hāsta
 	 	and	 	queen	 	moreover	 	thirty	 	daughters	 	gave birth to
 	 	"When the years meanwhile passed by, the queen, in addition, gave birth to thirty daughters."
In this sentence from the "Proclamation of Telepenus," the use of mān can be contrasted with the use of the conjunctions māhhan and kuwāpi in the "Annals of Mursilis" below:

 	 	māan-san	 	MTelepenus	 	INA	 	GIŠGU-za	 	ABI-YA	 	ēshat
 	 	when-locatival	 	Telepenus	 	on	 	throne	 	of-father-my	 	sat
 	 	nu	 	URUHassuwa	 	lahha	 	pāun	 	 	 	 
 	 	and	 	Hassuwa	 	on campaign	 	I went	 	 	 	 
 	 	"When I, Telepenus, seated myself upon the throne of my father, I went on a military campaign to Hassuwa."
33.2 Adverbial Clauses with māhhan 'when'
Clauses of time with the conjunction māhhan are first attested slightly later than those with mān. Possibly māhhan could introduce time clauses in the earliest Hittite, and our lack of examples from the earliest period is accidental. It is also possible, however, that māhhan may have replaced mān in this function fairly early. Unlike the clauses with mān, clauses with māhhan are common.

 	 	mahhan-ta	 	kās	 	tuppianza	 	anda wemiyazzi	 	 
 	 	as soon as-you	 	this	 	tablet	 	reaches	 	 
 	 	nu	 	MAHAR	 	DUTUŠI	 	liliwanuwanzi	 	ūnni
 	 	and	 	before	 	my majesty	 	in a hurry	 	drive
 	 	"As soon as this tablet reaches you, travel in a hurry to my majesty."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mahhan-ma	 	hameshanza	 	kisat	 	man	 	INA	 	KUR	 	(URU)Azzi
 	 	when-but	 	spring	 	became	 	[irrealis]	 	into	 	country	 	of Azzi
 	 	taninumanzi	 	pāun	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	to restore order	 	I went	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"But as soon as it became spring, I would have gone into the land of Azzi to restore order."
In texts from the period of the Hittite Empire, māhhan is often written with the Sumerogram GIM plus the phonetic complement -an:

 	 	GIM-an-ma	 	ABU-YA	 	BA.UŠ	 	ŠEŠ-YA-ma-za-kan
 	 	when-but	 	father-my	 	died	 	brother-my-but-reflexive-locatival
 	 	ANA	 	GIŠGU.ZA	 	ABI-ŠU	 	ēsat
 	 	on	 	throne	 	father-his	 	seated himself
 	 	"But when my father died, my brother seated himself on the throne of his father."
33.3 Adverbial Clauses with kuwāpi 'when'
The relative adverb kuwāpi, which usually means 'where', can also be used to signal adverbial clauses of time. In the following sentence, the conjunction is to be understood as introducing two clauses "when my father was fighting with Urhi-Tessup" and "and (when) he deposed him from kingship":

 	 	ABU-YA	 	kuwapi	 	MHattusilis	 	ANA	 	MÚrhitessupas
 	 	father-my	 	when	 	Hattusilis	 	with	 	Urhitessup
 	 	DUMU	 	MMūwattalli	 	menahhanda	 	kururiahta	 	 
 	 	son	 	Muwattallis	 	against	 	started fighting	 	 
 	 	n-an	 	LUGAL-iznanni	 	arha tittanut	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-him	 	from kingship	 	deposed	 	 	 	 
 	 	ANA	 	M.DLAMMMA-ma-kan	 	wastul	 	ŪL kuitki	 	āsta
 	 	to	 	Kurunta-but-locatival	 	blame	 	not any	 	remained
 	 	"When my father, Hattusilis, began fighting with Urhi-Tessup, son of Muwattallis, and deposed him from kingship, no fault attached to (lit. 'remained with') Kurunta."
The following two sentences from the "Annals of Mursilis" suggest that, in introducing time clauses, māhhan and kuwāpi were essentially synonyms.

 	 	mahhan-ma-za-kan	 	DUTUŠI	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	when-but-reflexive-locatival	 	my majesty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ANA	 	GIŠGU.ZA	 	ABI-YA	 	ēshat	 	 	 	 
 	 	on	 	throne	 	father-my	 	seated myself	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-mu	 	arahzenas	 	KUR.KUR	 	LÚKÚR	 	kuyēs	 	kūruriyahhir
 	 	then-on-me	 	surrounding	 	lands	 	hostile	 	that	 	made war
 	 	"But when (I), my majesty, had seated himself on the throne of my father, the surrounding hostile lands that had made war on me..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-za-kan	 	ANA	 	GIŠGU.ZA	 	ABI-YA	 	kuwapi
 	 	and-reflexive-locatival	 	on	 	throne	 	father-my	 	when
 	 	ēshat	 	nu-za	 	kē	 	arahzenas	 	KUR.KURMEŠ
 	 	seated myself	 	and-reflexive	 	these	 	surrounding	 	lands
 	 	LÚKÚR	 	INA	 	MU.10.KAM	 	tarhhun	 	 
 	 	hostile	 	in	 	ten years	 	I defeated	 	 
 	 	"When I had seated myself on the throne of my father, I defeated these surrounding enemy lands in ten years."
33.4 Adverbial Clauses with kuitman 'while, until'
The conjunction kuitman, as noted above, means 'while' or 'until'. It is generally used to signal adverbial clauses that indicate action taking place in the background of some other action, for example:

 	 	nu-za	 	kuitman	 	nūwa	 	DUMU-as	 	esun
 	 	and-reflexive	 	while	 	still	 	child	 	I was
 	 	ŠA	 	KUŠKA.TAB.ANŠE-za	 	esun	 	 	 	 
 	 	of	 	donkey	 	I was	 	 	 	 
 	 	"And while I was still a child, I was foolish."
 	 	kuētman-ma	 	MUNUS.ŠU.GI	 	kēdas	 	kezzi	 	 
 	 	While-but	 	old woman	 	these	 	from there	 	 
 	 	EGIR-an-ma-ssan	 	ÍD-i	 	peran	 	 	 	 
 	 	in her absence-but-locatival	 	river	 	beside	 	 	 	 
 	 	GIŠZA.LAM.GARHI.A	 	ŠA	 	GI	 	karū	 	iyanta
 	 	tents	 	of	 	reed	 	already	 	made
 	 	"But while the 'old woman' is getting these (things), from there, in (her) absence, beside the river, tents of reeds have already been made."
The following passage from the Law Code, which specifies the restitution someone is to make for injuring someone else, illustrates a contrast between kuitman 'until' and mān 'when':

 	 	nu	 	Éri-ssi	 	anniskezzi	 	kuitm:an-as	 	lāzziatta
 	 	and	 	in-house-his	 	he keeps working	 	until-he	 	recovers
 	 	mān-as	 	lāzziatta-ma	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	when-he	 	recovers-but	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-ssi	 	6	 	GÍN	 	KÙ.BABBAR	 	pāi
 	 	then-to-him	 	six	 	shekels	 	silver	 	he gives
 	 	"He (a substitute worker provided by the offender) keeps working in his (the victim's) house until he recovers. But when he recovers, he (the offender) gives him six shekels of silver."
When used with the negative adverb nāwi 'not yet', kuitman means 'before', or literally "while ...as not yet ...":

 	 	nu	 	nekuz mehur	 	kuitman-kan	 	DUTU-us	 	nāwi	 	ūpzi
 	 	and	 	in the night time	 	while-locatival	 	sun	 	not yet	 	rises
 	 	"And during the night, before the sun arises..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuitman	 	gimmanza	 	nāwi	 	zinnattat
 	 	while	 	winter	 	not yet	 	ended
 	 	"Before winter had ended..."
34 The emphasizing particle -pat
The function of -pat is to emphasize, define, specify, or limit the element within the sentence to which it is attached. It may be attached to virtually any part of speech or to entire clauses. It is not part of the enclitic chain; indeed if a chain of enclitics is attached to a word to which -pat is also attached, the particle -pat precedes the enclitic chain (cf. ammel-pat-wa-za or aki-pat-ssan below).

34.1 Previous mention
A common use of -pat is to refer back to an item or action that has been mentioned immediately before. It can often be translated as 'the very' (noun), 'the same', or 'the very same':

 	 	A.BU-YA-nnas-za	 	MMurslis	 	4	 	DUMUMEŠ	 	...	 	hasta
 	 	father-my-us-reflexive	 	Mursilis	 	four	 	children	 	...	 	fathered
 	 	humandas-pat	 	EGIR-izzis	 	DUMU-as	 	esun	 	 	 	 
 	 	of-all-very	 	last	 	child	 	I was	 	 	 	 
 	 	"My father, Mursilis, fathered us four children ... (and) I was the very last (i.e., 'the youngest') of all the children."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-as	 	seszi	 	kuwapi	 	nu-za-kan
 	 	and-he	 	sleeps	 	where	 	and-reflexive
 	 	apiya-pat	 	warpzi	 	 	 	 
 	 	in the place-very-same	 	he bathes	 	 	 	 
 	 	"And he sleeps in the very same place where he bathes."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	EGIR-pa-ma-as	 	kuwapi	 	wezzi	 	n-as
 	 	back-but-he	 	when	 	goes	 	and-he
 	 	āppa-ya-pat	 	apūn	 	KASKAL-an	 	wezzi
 	 	back-and-very	 	that	 	route	 	he goes
 	 	"But when he returns, he also returns by the very same route as before."
34.2 Reflexive, etc.
When attached to a noun, -pat may add the sense of a reflexive pronoun or it may be translated by 'own' or 'only':

 	 	MMadduwattas-pat	 	nekumanza	 	isparzasta
 	 	Madduwattas-himself	 	naked	 	escaped
 	 	"Madduwattas himself escaped naked."
 	 	ammel-pat-wa-za	 	GU4	 	dahhi
 	 	my-own-quotative-reflexive	 	ox	 	I take
 	 	"I will take my own ox."
 	 	nu	 	sumās	 	DINGIRMEŠ-as	 	URUHattusas-pat
 	 	and	 	for you	 	gods	 	Hatti-only
 	 	handān	 	parkui	 	KUR-e	 	 
 	 	true	 	pure	 	land	 	 
 	 	"Only Hatti is a true, pure land for you, gods."
34.3 Clauses
When -pat modifies a clause, it can have meanings such as "in addition, instead, rather, even though," and "surely," or "certainly":

 	 	namma	 	tuzziyas-mis	 	hwettiyanun-pat
 	 	then	 	army-my	 	drew up-in addition
 	 	"Then, in addition, I drew up my army."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-as	 	KUR	 	URUHattusi	 	ŪL	 	hūisuwezzi
 	 	and-he	 	land	 	Hattusas	 	not	 	lives
 	 	aki-pat-ssan	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	he dies-instead-locatival	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"He will not go on living in Hattusas; instead, he will die there."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-mu	 	kappin-pat	 	DUMU-an	 	DIŠTAR	 	URUSamuha
 	 	and-me	 	small-although	 	child	 	Ishtar	 	Samuha
 	 	ANA	 	ABU-YA	 	wēkta	 	 	 	 
 	 	dative	 	father-my	 	demanded	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Even though I was a small child, Ishtar of Samuha demanded me from my father."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at	 	akkandu-pat
 	 	and-they	 	die-surely
 	 	"And they shall surely die."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-an-kan	 	ŪL-pat	 	wahnunun
 	 	and-it-locatival	 	not-certainly	 	I turned
 	 	"And certainly I did not alter it (a tablet)."
This sentence has the irrealis particle man used to express a wish of the speaker, and -pat used to emphasize the wish:

 	 	iyami-man-pat-wa	 	kuitki
 	 	I do irrealis-surely-quotative	 	something
 	 	"I certainly would like to do something."
35 Coordinating Conjunctions
Hittite has a number of both independent words and enclitics that may be used to conjoin sentences, clauses, phrases, and words.

35.1 Nu
The loosest sort of connection between clauses is signaled by the sentence-initial particle nu, and, indeed, the translation of nu often depends as much upon the interpretation of individual readers of the logical relationship between sentences or clauses as it does on outside evidence. In translating a Hittite text into idiomatic English, it is often neither necessary nor desirable to translate nu, and it has, in fact, been suggested that nu is often used as a more or less empty prop to which clause-initial enclitics are attached. Nu was not the only sentence-initial connective in Hittite, In early texts, it is found beside the rarer su and ta, which also take the clause-initial enclitics, and which presumably shared functions with nu, but su and ta were eventually eliminated from the language. In texts from the Empire period, nu very frequently begins sentences, though by no means all sentences begin with nu.

Nu may begin an independent sentence following another independent sentence, and its function in such sequences is similar to that of English and as a connector of independent sentences:

 	 	nu-war-an	 	ammuk	 	parā pāi
 	 	and-quotative-him	 	to me	 	give
 	 	nu-war-as-mu	 	sankunis	 	ēsdu
 	 	and-quotative-he-to-me	 	priest	 	let him be
 	 	"Give him to me, (and) he will be my priest."
The particle may occur at the beginning of a clause that describes action that follows the action of the initial clause temporally or action that is the logical result of the action of the initial clause, and in such sequences, it may be translated as 'then' or 'so'. Again, nu should be considered a coordinating conjunction in such sequences of sentences.

 	 	nu-mu	 	apppatar	 	hatrāttin	 	nu	 	seggalu
 	 	and-to-me	 	receipt	 	write	 	so	 	I may know
 	 	"Write me a receipt, so that I may know."
In some sequences of independent sentences, nu may have a mildly adversative sense and can be translated by 'but':

 	 	mān-us-kan	 	MHuzziyas	 	kuenta	 	nu	 	uttar	 	isduwāti
 	 	irrealis-them-locatival	 	Huzziyas	 	killed	 	but	 	plan	 	became known
 	 	"Huzziyas would have killed them, but the plan became known."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	man	 	INA	 	URUHayasa	 	pāun-pat
 	 	irrealis	 	into	 	Hayasa	 	I went-also
 	 	nu-za	 	MU.KAM-za	 	ser tēpauēssanza	 	 
 	 	and-reflexive	 	year	 	had become short	 	 
 	 	"I would also have gone to Hayasa (to attack it), but the year had become short."
Nu may also be used to connect clauses clauses that amplify or qualify dependent temporal, result, or relative clauses:

 	 	māan-san	 	MTelepenus	 	INA	 	GIŠGU-za	 	ABI-YA	 	ēshat
 	 	when-locatival	 	Telepenus	 	on	 	throne	 	father-my	 	sat
 	 	nu	 	URUHassuwa	 	lahh	 	pāun	 	 	 	 
 	 	and	 	Hassuwa	 	on campaign	 	I went	 	 	 	 
 	 	"When I, Telepenus, seated myself upon the throne of my father, then I went on a military campaign to Hassuwa."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuis	 	ammel	 	āppan	 	LUGAL-us	 	kīsari
 	 	who	 	me	 	after	 	king	 	becomes
 	 	nu	 	URUHattus-an	 	āppa	 	asasi	 	 
 	 	and	 	Hattusas	 	again	 	settles	 	 
 	 	n-an	 	nepisas	 	DIŠKUR-as	 	hazziettu	 	 
 	 	and-him	 	of heaven	 	the Stormgod	 	let him smite	 	 
 	 	"Whoever becomes king after me and settles Hattusas again, may the Stormgod of Heaven smite him!"
35.2 namma 'when'
The adverbial conjunction namma, 'then', 'next', 'moreover' or 'furthermore', can have the effect of indicating that one action follows closely upon another, or that action is being resumed. It often, though not inevitably, comes at the beginning of a clause or sentence, indicating the resumption or continuation of some action. It may also introduce the end of an on-going activity, having a meaning something like 'finally'. Like its English counterparts, it does not begin texts, but it may be used to begin a paragraph within a text, indicating a connection with the previous paragraph. The following sentences from the "Ritual of Tuwananni" follow a spell which the ritual practioner recites and indicate that she is now performing further actions designed to benefit the patient:

 	 	namma	 	wappuwas	 	IM-an	 	dāi
 	 	moreover	 	of the spring	 	clay	 	she takes
 	 	namma-as	 	sakuniya	 	paizzi	 	 
 	 	moreover-she	 	to the spring	 	goes	 	 
 	 	"Moreover, she takes clay of the river bank (and), moreover, she goes to the spring."
Namma may also be used to indicate a series of consecutive actions:

 	 	namma	 	LÚKUR	 	ispandaza	 	anda ari
 	 	Then	 	enemy	 	by night	 	arrived
 	 	namma-as	 	arha sarrattari	 	 	 	 
 	 	then-they	 	split up	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Then the enemy arrived by night and (then they) split up."
It may follow a sentence particle such as nu with or without attached enclitics. In this sentence, the nominative enclitic personal pronoun is necessary, because the verb is an intransitive verb that requires an explicit subject:

 	 	n-as	 	namma	 	aruni	 	zahhiya	 	pait
 	 	and-he	 	then	 	to the sea	 	to battle	 	went
 	 	"Then he went to the sea to battle."
35.3 nasma and nassu 'or'
The conjunctions nasma and nassu, both of which mean 'or' or 'either', are disjunctive in force. They may be used to contrast clauses, for example:

 	 	nu-ssi-kan	 	É	 	ABI-ŠU	 	arha danzi	 	 
 	 	and-to-him-locatival	 	estate	 	father-his	 	take away	 	 
 	 	n-at	 	nassu	 	damēdani	 	kuedanikki	 	pianzi
 	 	and-it	 	either	 	to another	 	to anyone	 	they give
 	 	nasma-at	 	INA	 	É.GAL	 	danzi	 	 
 	 	or-it	 	for	 	palace	 	they take	 	 
 	 	"They take his father's estate from him and either give it to someone else or take it for palace (i.e. confiscate it for the palace's use)."
nasma and nassu are also used to oppose elements within a phrase:

 	 	takku	 	LÚ-an	 	nasma	 	MUNUS-an	 	sullanaz	 	kuiski	 	kuenzi
 	 	if	 	man	 	or	 	woman	 	quarrel	 	someone	 	kills
 	 	"If someone kills a man or a woman as the result of a quarrel."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	ÌR-as	 	nasma	 	GEME-as	 	huwāi
 	 	if	 	male slave	 	or	 	female slave	 	runs
 	 	"If (either) a male slave or a female slave runs away..."
The particle m:an may be used as a conjunction in the sense 'whether':

 	 	mān	 	hargaēs	 	mān	 	dankuwaēs	 	ŪL kuitki	 	duqqāri
 	 	whether	 	white	 	or whether	 	black	 	not at all	 	is important
 	 	"Whether (the rams) are white or black is not at all important."

Lesson 8
Sara E. Kimball, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
Unlike the speakers of the other Indo-European languages, the Hittites have many prayers among their literary products. These probably resulted from influence by their Semitic neighbors. From the book of Daniel, Chapter 6, we know that the Hebrews prayed three times a day, but lengthy prayers like those of the Hittites are not recorded in the Old Testament. For the most part the Psalms, if considered to be prayers, are general hymns of praise. Nor are they as lengthy nor as specifically directed at problems as those of the Hittites.

The plague prayers of Mursilis II, circa 1321-1295, are highly specific, as the sections from one included here illustrate. The other selection details the effects of the plague without indicating a possible reason for it. As here, the prayer is read to the god by a scribe sent by the king.

Reading and Textual Analysis
This prayer is highly structured. In the first section included here, the purpose of the prayer is stated, that being to remove the plague that has affected the kingdom since the days of Mursilis's father, Suppiluliumas I. Mursilis then absolves himself of the blame, and seeks the reason for it. An oracle tells him of two tablets, the second of which is summarized in the second section included here. While the source of the plague might seem to us to be the prisoners brought back after the war with the Egyptians, Mursilis finds from a further oracle as the source that the Hattians broke their word, which they had given in a treaty made under oath to the Hattian Storm-god. Mursilis then indicates the steps he has taken to appease the Storm-god. He has presented him and also other gods with offerings, while confessing that humans are sinful, as was his father, though he himself has committed no sin. Becoming poetic he points out that a bird takes refuge in its nest, and the nest then saves its life. Similarly, if a servant repents and appeals to his lord, the lord will not punish him. Mursilis has now confessed the sin of his father. But if that is not the reason for people dying, he makes a final request to the Storm-god that he inform him in a dream, or an oracle, or through a prophet, ending with the request that the Storm-god save his life and let the plague abate.

Translation
O, Stormgod of Hatti, my Lord, and gods of Hatti, my Lords, Mursilis your servant has sent me, (saying) go and speak to the Stormgod of Hatti and to the gods, My Lords, as follows: "What is this that you have done? You have let loose the plague in the interior of the land of Hatti. And the land of Hatti has been sorely, greatly oppressed by the plague. Under my father (and) under my brother there was constant dying. And since I became priest of the gods, there is now constant dying under me. Behold, it is twenty years since people have been continually dying in the interior of Hatti. Will the plague never be eliminated from the land of Hatti? I cannot overcome the worry from my heart; I cannot overcome the anguish from my soul."
The second tablet concerned the town of Kurustamma--how the Stormgod of Hatti brought the men of Kurustamma into the territory of Egypt (and) how the Stormgod of Hatti made a treaty between them and the men of Hatti. And they were put under oath by the Stormgod of Hatti and the men of Egypt were (bound) under oath by the Stormgod of Hatti. And the men of Hatti got the upper hand and immediately the men of Hatti broke the oath (of the treaty). My father sent infantry and chariot fighters and they attacked the border territory at Amga. And, moreover, he sent (more troops); and again, they attacked. (The tablet related) How the men of Egypt became afraid. They came, and they asked my father outright for his son for kingship. And when they led him away, they killed him. And my father became angry, and he went into Egyptian territory, and he attacked the infantry and chariot fighters of Egypt.
Grammar
36 R-, L- and N-stem nouns
Unlike the neuter r/n-stem nouns, the r-stem nouns have a suffix in -r- throughout their paradigms. The word for "hand," kessar, which is animate, retains an especially archaic kind of inflection. In the nominative singular, the archaic form kessar is often replaced by kessaras with -as the ending of nominative animate a-stems:

 	 	Singular	 	Plural
nom.	 	kess-ar	 	 
acc.	 	kess-er-an	 	kiss-er-us
gen	 	kis-r-as	 	*kiss-r-as
dat/loc.	 	kessar, kiss-ar-i, kis-r-i, kessar	 	kis-r-as
abl.	 	kiss-ar-ā	 	 
inst	 	kiss-ar-az, kis-r-az	 	 
all.	 	kiss-r-it	 	 
The paradigms of other r-stem nouns are not as elaborate as that of kessar. These nouns have traditionally been understood as neuters, but evidence from adjectival and pronominal agreement suggests that at least some may originally have been animate. The nouns huppar 'bowl' and kūrur 'war, hostility' illustrate the inflection of nouns in -ar- and -ur-. Like kessar, huppar sometimes adopts the ending of the animate a-stem nouns. Forms with the animate accusative a-stem ending -an are also found. Nominative-accusative plural neuter and nominative and accusative forms both occur. In some contexts, kūrur is best translated as an adjective 'hostile'. Nominative-accusative plural neuter forms occur, and genitive and dative-locative plural forms end, like huppar, in -as, but accusative forms are not attested.

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	hupp-ar, hupp-ar-as	 	kūr-ur, kūr-ur-as
acc.	 	hupp-ar, hupp-ar-an	 	 
gen.	 	huppar-as	 	kūr-ur-as
dat/loc.	 	hupp-ar-i	 	kū-ur-i
abl.	 	hupp-ar-az, huppa-ra-za	 	kūr-ur-an-za
inst.	 	hupp-ar-it	 	*kūr-ur-it
all.	 	*huppar-a	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom/acc. neut.	 	hupp-ar-i	 	kū-ur, kū-ur-i
nom.	 	hupp-ar-as	 	 
acc.	 	hupp-ar-us	 	 
gen.	 	hupp-ar-as	 	*kū-ur-as
dat/loc.	 	*hupp-ar-as	 	kū-ur-as
L-stem nouns have a suffix with -l throughout their paradigms. Like the r-stems, they may, at least in part, have originally been animate. Ishiul 'instruction, treaty', which is related to the verb ishiya- 'bind', illustrates the inflection of a stem in -ul-. Mēmal 'meal' is a stem in -al-:

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	ishi-ul	 	mēmal
acc.	 	ishi-ul	 	mēmal
gen.	 	ishi-ul-as	 	mēmal-as
dat/loc.	 	ishi-ul-i	 	*mēmal-i
abl.	 	ishi-ul-aza	 	 
inst.	 	*ishi-ul-it	 	mēmal-it
all.	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom/acc. neut.	 	ishi-ul-i	 	 
37 The Allative
With verbs of motion or setting in motion, the allative is the case that indicates goal. Its ending is -a or -ā. The allative is an archaism and normally found in older texts and in later copies of older texts:

 	 	namma-as	 	sakuniya (all.)	 	paizzi
 	 	moreover-she	 	to the spring	 	goes
 	 	"Moreover, she goes to the spring."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-as	 	āsga	 	parā paizzi
 	 	and-he	 	to the gate (all.)	 	goes onward
 	 	"He goes onward to the gate."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ÍD-pa	 	ishuwai
 	 	into the river (all.)	 	she scatters
 	 	"She scatters into the river"
The dative-locative, with or without a postposition, was also used to indicate goals in early texts, and in texts composed in the period of the Hittite Empire, the allative was gradually replaced by the dative-locative:

 	 	n-at-kan	 	kariz	 	aruni	 	anda	 	pidāu
 	 	and-it-locatival	 	flood	 	to the sea (dat.)	 	into	 	let carry
 	 	"Let the flood carry it into the sea (or 'The flood shall carry it into the sea')."
38 Relative and Indefinite Pronouns and Clauses
In Hittite, as in English, the relative and interrogative pronouns and adverbs are identical in form:

Singular	 	animate	 	 	 	neuter
nom.	 	kuis	 	 	 	kuit
acc.	 	kuin	 	 	 	kuit
gen.	 	 	 	kuēl	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	kuedani	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	kuēz	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	kuyēs	 	 	 	kue
acc.	 	kuyus	 	 	 	kue
gen.	 	 	 	 	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	kuedas	 	 
abl.	 	 	 	 	 	 
Hittite sentences with relative clauses are composed of at least two clauses: a main clause and a subordinate relative clause modifying a noun in the main clause. Either the main clause or the relative clause may have additional subordinate clauses (e.g., adverbial clauses). As in English, the relative pronoun or adverb need not have the same syntactic function as the noun it modifies in the relative clause. One way in which Hittite relative clauses differ from English relative clauses is that the main clause often has a pronoun or noun that refers back to the relative pronoun.

38.1 Definite and Indefinite Relative Clauses
Hittite has two kinds of relative clauses: so-called determinate relative clauses, clauses in which the relative pronoun refers to a specific known entity, and indeterminate relative clauses, clauses in which the relative pronoun refers to an unspecified entity whose existence may be in doubt. The indeterminate clauses are similar in meaning to English clauses with the indefinite relative pronouns "whoever" and "whichever," etc., or to clauses in which the noun modified is preceded by an indefinite such as "any." Determinate and indeterminate clauses are distinguished by the position of the relative pronoun:

In indeterminate clauses, the relative is in initial position. It may be preceded only by a conjunction (with or without attached enclitics):

 	 	kuis	 	IKRIBI	 	sarninkuwas	 	n-an	 	sarninkanzi
 	 	whatever	 	votive offering	 	of restitution	 	and-it	 	they make restitution
 	 	"Any votive offering which is to be made in restitution, they will make it (in) restitution."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-asta	 	kuis	 	kūs	 	NIŠ DINGIRMEŠ	 	sarriezzi
 	 	and-locatival	 	anyone who	 	these	 	oaths	 	breaks
 	 	n-an	 	kē	 	NIŠ DINGIRMEŠ	 	appandu	 	 
 	 	and-him	 	these	 	oaths	 	let them seize	 	 
 	 	"Let these oaths seize anyone who breaks these oaths."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuit	 	handān	 	apāt	 	īssa
 	 	whatever	 	fitting	 	that	 	he shall do
 	 	"Whatever is fitting, that he shall do."
In determinate clauses, by contrast, the relative is never clause initial. It may precede or follow the noun or noun phrase it refers to:

 	 	nu	 	IKRIBIHI.A-ma	 	kuyēs	 	sarnikuwēs	 	n-as	 	sarninkanzi
 	 	and	 	votive-offerings-but	 	that	 	restitution	 	and-them	 	they make restitution
 	 	"But they will make in restitution those votive offerings which are to be made in restitution."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	tuk-ma	 	DUTUŠI	 	kuit	 	KUR-TAM	 	ADDIN
 	 	to you-but	 	my majesty	 	which	 	land	 	I have given
 	 	nu-za	 	apāt	 	KUR-TAM	 	pahsi	 	 
 	 	and-reflexive	 	that	 	land	 	protect	 	 
 	 	"But protect that land which I, my majesty, have given to you."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	BE-LU-ma	 	kuyus	 	LÚ. MEŠTEMI	 	wiēskesi
 	 	lord-but	 	whom	 	messengers	 	you keep sending
 	 	n-as-kan	 	ammuk	 	parā naiskemi	 	 
 	 	and-them-locatival	 	I	 	will keep dispatching	 	 
 	 	"Lord, the messengers whom you keep sending, I will keep dispatching them (to their next stop)."
38.2 Non-restrictive Relative Clauses
Like English, Hittite made a distinction between restrictive, or identifying clauses, such as those give above, that identify a particular person or entity and non-restrictive, or commenting clauses, that simply provide a comment on the noun they modify. Non-restrictive clauses, which are relatively infrequent, always come after the main clause:

 	 	nu-za	 	DKumarbis	 	GALAG-tar	 	ZI-ni	 	kattan daskezzi
 	 	and-reflexive	 	Kumarbi	 	wisdom	 	into mind	 	takes
 	 	UD.KAM-an	 	kuis	 	LÚ	 	HUL-an	 	sallanuskezzi
 	 	day	 	who	 	man	 	evil	 	raises
 	 	"Kumarbi, who raises the day as an evil being, takes wisdom into his mind."
38.3 Relative Adverbs
Relative clauses may also contain relative adverbs modifying expressions of time or place, for example:

 	 	n-as	 	seszi	 	kuwapi	 	nu-za-kan	 	apiya-pat	 	warpzi
 	 	and-he	 	sleeps	 	where	 	and-reflexive	 	in-place-very-same	 	he bathes
 	 	"And he sleeps in the very same place where he bathes."
38.4 Emphasis
Indefinite relative clauses are emphasized in a number of ways. The conjunctive particle -a 'but' is sometimes found attached to the relative pronoun, for example:

 	 	namma	 	kuis-a	 	LUGAL-us	 	kisari
 	 	moreover	 	whoever	 	king	 	becomes
 	 	"Moreover, whoever becomes king..."
The relative pronoun may be repeated:

 	 	LÚ-as	 	kuis kuis	 	LUGAL-was	 	peran	 	ēszi
 	 	man	 	whichever	 	king	 	in front of	 	sits
 	 	"Whichever man sits in front of the king..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuit kuit	 	harkzi	 	t-at	 	sarnikzi
 	 	whatever	 	gets lost	 	and-it	 	he compensates
 	 	"He compensates whatever is lost."
The relative pronoun in indefinitie clauses is sometimes strengthened with the adverb imma, which when used independently means 'indeed, surely', and this adverb often comes between repeated relative pronouns:

 	 	kuis-kan imma kuis	 	ŠA-BI	 	KUR	 	ÍDHulaya	 	es:zi
 	 	whoever-locatival-indeed-who	 	inside	 	land	 	Hulaya river	 	is
 	 	"Whoever is in the Hulaya river land..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuedani imma kuedani	 	ITU-mi
 	 	in-whatever-indeed-in-which	 	in month
 	 	"in whatever month"
In addition to the relative-interrogative pronoun and adjective in kui- Hittite also had remnants of a interrogative and indefinite relative made from a stem masi-. Although the pronoun itself is relatively rare, its stem masi- forms the basis for several relative adverbs and adjectives, such as masiwan 'as much as, how much as, however many times', or masianki 'however many times'. Its use seems to parallel that of kui- in indefinite relatives.

 	 	nu-kan	 	INA	 	URUZithara	 	masiyēs
 	 	and-locatival	 	in	 	Zithara	 	however many
 	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	ŠÀ	 	ÉDINGIRLIM	 	 
 	 	deities	 	of	 	temple	 	 
 	 	n-at	 	hūmandus-pat	 	SIXSA-antat	 	 
 	 	and-they	 	all-surely	 	were determined by oracle	 	 
 	 	"However many deities (are) in the temple in Zithara, they were all determined by oracle (as causes of the king's sickness)."
As with kui-, indeterminate relative clauses may be strengthened by repeating the pronoun or by the addition of the adverb imma 'indeed'.

38.5 Indefinite Pronouns
In addition to relative and interrogative pronouns, Hittite has a series of indefinite pronouns meaning "someone," "something," "anyone," or "anything." These are made from the relative-interrogative pronoun to which a particle spelled ki, ka, ga or qa is attached. They are used in non-relative sentences in which the referent of the pronoun is an unknown person or thing.

 	 	if	 	merchant	 	Hatti	 	someone	 	kills
 	 	"If someone kills a merchant of the city of Hatti..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	GU4-s	 	A.ŠÀHI.A-ni	 	kuelqa	 	aki
 	 	if	 	cow	 	in field	 	someone's	 	dies
 	 	"If a cow dies in someone's field..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	ANA	 	KUR	 	LÚKÚR	 	nawi kuitman	 	kuedanikki	 	pāun
 	 	and	 	to	 	country	 	hostile	 	before	 	any	 	I went
 	 	"Before I went into any hostile country..."
When the indefinite pronouns are used with negative particles, their sense is "no one," "nobody," "nothing," etc.:

 	 	lē kuitki	 	sannaskesi
 	 	nothing	 	conceal
 	 	"Keep nothing secret."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at-za	 	parā	 	le kuiski	 	kuedanikki	 	memai
 	 	and-it-reflexive	 	to	 	nobody	 	to anyone	 	say
 	 	"Let nobody tell it to anyone."
39 The Uses of har-, hark-
The verb har-, hark- basically means 'have, hold, keep'. Its stem-final consonant is lost before endings beginning with consonants, and the resulting paradigm has a stem that alternates between har- (e.g., harzi 'she has') and hark- (e.g., harkanzi 'they have'):

Present	 	Singular	 	Plural
1.	 	har-mi	 	har-wani, har-weni
2	 	har-si, har-ti	 	har-teni
3.	 	har-zi	 	hark-anzi
Preterit	 	 	 	 
1.	 	hark-un	 	har-wen
2.	 	har-ta	 	har-ten
3.	 	har-ta	 	hark-er
Imperative	 	 	 	 
2.	 	hark	 	har-ten
3.	 	har-du	 	hark-andu
The loss of the stem-final k is not the result of a regular sound change (compare, for example, har-ak-zi 'it perishes', a spelling for /hargtsi/, stem harg-) but the loss may have come about because the verb is used very commonly, especially as an auxiliary verb in a construction much like the English perfect with "have." Compare the reduction of the verb in forms of the English perfect in which the auxiliary verb "have" has been contracted (e.g., "I've fed the cat") for a similar sort of reduction in a common auxiliary verb. The second person singular imperative, spelled har-ak, indicates that the stem-final consonant was not lost before a pause.

39.1 Basic meaning
The verb often has the simple meaning 'have':

 	 	GIŠTUKUL-ma	 	kuin	 	apiya	 	harkun
 	 	weapon-but	 	that	 	there	 	I had
 	 	"But the weapon that I had there..."
It may also mean 'hold', both in the literal sense and in the sense 'restrain':

 	 	SÌG	 	dankuin	 	harmi
 	 	wool	 	black	 	I hold
 	 	"I hold the black wool."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nepis	 	tēkan-a	 	harsi
 	 	heaven	 	earth-and	 	you hold
 	 	"You hold heaven and earth."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	appūnn-a-wa	 	hahhimas	 	harzi
 	 	and	 	him-and-quotative	 	frost	 	holds
 	 	"And frost holds (or restrains) him too."
39.2 Use with Adjectives, Particples, and Locatives
With an adjective or participle from an intransitive verb, constructions with hark- can mean 'hold' or 'keep' something in the state denoted by the adjective or participle:

 	 	n-an	 	TI-nuan	 	hartin
 	 	and-him	 	alive	 	keep
 	 	"Keep him alive!"
Such constructions also occur with nouns in the locative:

 	 	apedani-ya	 	uddani	 	wasduli	 	harteni
 	 	for this-and	 	for matter	 	in sin (loc.)	 	you hold
 	 	"...and for this matter you hold (us) in sin."
39.3 The Perfect
Hittite has perfect and past perfect constructions that use hark- as an auxiliary verb and that look remarkably like the perfect in English. Instead of being made with the auxiliary plus past participle as in English, however, the Hittite construction uses the only participle in the language, the participle in -ant in the nominative-accusative singular neuter. Normally, the verb is transitive. It is important to remember that although the hark-perfect is usually to be translated by appropriate forms of the English present and past perfect, simple past tense forms of any verb can be translated by the English perfect when the context demands such translations.

The present perfect is composed of hark- plus the nominative-accusative neuter of the participle:

 	 	ANŠE.KUR.RAMEŠ	 	tūriyan harti
 	 	horses	 	harnessed you have
 	 	"You (singular) have harnessed the horses."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-at	 	waranti	 	pahhuni	 	piyan harzi
 	 	and-it	 	burning	 	fire	 	given he has
 	 	"He has given it to burning fire."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	sumas-ma-az	 	kuin	 	maklandan	 	markan-harteni
 	 	for you-but-reflexive	 	whatever	 	thin-one	 	cut up you have
 	 	"But whatever thin (animal) you have cut up for yourselves..."
The construction of the past perfect is essentially the same, except the auxiliary verb is in the past tense:

 	 	EN-YA	 	ZI-an	 	ŪL	 	warsiyanuwan harkun
 	 	lord-my	 	soul	 	not	 	appeased I had
 	 	"I had not appeased the soul of my lord."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	antuhsatar	 	ŪL	 	tarnan hartin
 	 	and	 	humanity	 	not	 	let loose you had
 	 	"You had not abandoned humanity."
The combination of participle plus auxiliary may be broken up by the conjunction kuit 'because':

 	 	nu-mu	 	istamassan	 	kuit	 	harker
 	 	and-me	 	heard	 	because	 	they had
 	 	"And because they had heard me..."
There are relatively few examples of the hark-perfect made with intransitive verbs:

 	 	nu-za	 	LÚKÚR	 	halkius	 	warsūwanzi	 	arha tarnan harta
 	 	and-reflexive	 	enemy	 	grain	 	to harvest	 	gone away had
 	 	"The enemy had gone off to harvest the grain."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	mān	 	LÚ.MEŠMEŠEDI	 	kuēz	 	parasnan harkanzi
 	 	and	 	if	 	guards	 	to the side	 	squatted they have
 	 	"If he throws (the towel) to the side where the guards have squatted..."
40 The Reflexive Particle
The particle -za (or -az), often called the reflexive particle, is used to indicate that the action of the verb affects the subject of the sentence in some way. Compare, for example, the English sentence with the reflexive pronoun 'himself', "He made himself a sandwich." Since this sort of construction with a reflexive pronoun indicating that the action benefits the subject is fairly uncommon in English, it is only rarely that we would translate Hittite sentences with -za into English sentences with reflexive pronouns.

The verb hās- 'give birth' or 'beget' is often, though not inevitably, used with -za; hās- plus -za can be translated with an English reflexive:

 	 	nu-za	 	MUNUS-za	 	DUMU.NITA-an	 	hasta
 	 	and-reflexive	 	woman	 	son	 	bore
 	 	"And the woman bore herself a son (or, more idiomatically: 'And the woman bore a son')."
The verb ēs- can mean 'sit, take a seat', or 'seat one's self'. With -za, however, it means 'seat oneself':

 	 	māan-san	 	MTelepenus	 	INA	 	GIŠGU-za	 	 	 	 
 	 	when-locatival	 	Telepenus	 	on	 	on throne	 	 	 	 
 	 	ABI-YA	 	ēshat	 	nu	 	URUHassuwa	 	lahha	 	pāun
 	 	father-my	 	sat	 	then	 	Hassuwa	 	on campaign	 	I went
 	 	"When I, Telepenus, sat (or 'seated myself') upon the throne of my father, then I went on a military campaign to Hassuwa."
In the first clause of the following sentence, a plant is said to have grown on behalf of itself:

 	 	nu	 	sankus	 	alil	 	mahhan	 	nu-za	 	parkiyat
 	 	and	 	sankus	 	plant	 	just as	 	and-reflexive	 	grew
 	 	tuell-a	 	ŠA	 	DU	 	ZI-KA	 	parktaru	 	 
 	 	your-and	 	of	 	Stormgod	 	soul-your	 	let grow	 	 
 	 	"Just as the sankus flower grew, may your soul, O Stormgod grow."
Again, in this sentence from the "Plague Prayer of Mursilis" the action is supposed to affect the subject:

 	 	ammuk-ma-az	 	ŠÀ-az	 	lahlahhiman	 	ŪL	 	tarhmi
 	 	I-but-reflexive	 	from heart	 	worry	 	not	 	overcome
 	 	"But I cannot overcome the worry from (my) heart."
The compound verb pēran weriya- with -za means 'involve oneself with'. The following sentence is a nominal sentence made with the participle:

 	 	ANA	 	LÚ.ME^S	 	URUMira-ma-wa-za	 	peran lē weriyanza
 	 	with	 	men	 	Mira-but-quotative-reflexive	 	do not be involved
 	 	"Don't be involved with the men of Mira."
Sometimes the effect of -za is to change the meaning of the verb subtly. For example, the verb halzāi- generally means 'recite, call out', or sometimes 'read'. It can also mean 'summon'. In this sentence, a participant in a ritual calls out the Hattic word missā 'take':

 	 	nu	 	kās	 	missā	 	halzāi
 	 	and	 	this	 	missa	 	calls out
 	 	"And this (person) calls out 'missa'."
With -za, however, the meaning is 'invite':

 	 	nu-za	 	1 LIM	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	halzaīs
 	 	and-reflexive	 	one thousand	 	gods	 	he called
 	 	"And he invited the thousand gods (to a feast)."
The verb mimma- means 'refuse' without -za:

 	 	takku	 	attass-a	 	annas	 	mimmai
 	 	if	 	father-and	 	mother	 	refuse
 	 	"If the father and mother refuse (to make compensation to their daughter's jilted fiance)..."
With -za, however, the meaning of mimma- is 'reject':

 	 	UDU-us-za	 	SILÁ-ZU	 	mimmas
 	 	ewe-reflexive	 	lamb-her	 	rejected
 	 	"The ewe rejected her lamb."

Lesson 9
Sara E. Kimball, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
Although the Hittite political texts may be of greatest interest to us today, as indicated by the selections included in these lessons, religious texts like those in Lessons 8 through 10 make up far more of the materials left to us. Among these are recordings of the rituals. In contrast with the festivals, which are elaborate celebrations involving the gods, the rituals deal with individual problems, such as the one represented here. They have been referred to as examples of sympathetic magic. They are carried out by qualified persons, who are referred to as Old Women when they are females, as in the Tunnawi ritual. Among their topics, specific rituals deal with birth and development of individuals, removal of deficiencies or evils like the uncleanness that has supposedly brought about the inability of the ritualist to have children. As in this ritual, which involves activity next to a river, there are specific steps that need to be taken to overcome the deficiency. These are elaborated in great detail in the remainder of the ritual, and presumably at the end have succeeded in "purifying the twelve parts of the body of the ritualist and also reestablished his or her generative faculty."

Reading and Textual Analysis
The first passage given here identifies the problem of the ritualist as experiencing uncleanness and then states items of the specific ritual that will lead to a cure. The second passage specifies the animals involved, and then the clothing of a female ritualist. The following paragraph does the same for a male, followed by a list of the ingredients that the Old Woman must take along to the river bank which should remove the "evil uncleanness". Some of these must be given to the spirit of the river, such as part of a thin loaf of bread and a jug of wine, as she collects clay for fashioning objects involved in the cleansing. In the morning the ritualist comes to the river bank, puts on the black clothes, and is subjected to various actions by the Old Woman, such as having objects made from the clay of the river bank passed over him or her, all with appropriate statements by the Old Woman. These are listed in thirty further sections, the last of which provides the assurance of purification as given above.

Translation
6 When she arrives at the river bank, she crumbles one thin bread for the Mother Goddess of the River Bank and places it on the river bank. She scatters sweet oil cake and meal on it. She libates wine and she says:
7 "O, Mother Goddess of the River Bank, behold, I have come back to you." "From whatever river bank this clay is taken, take the clay in your hand, scrub the patient with it and purify him or her in his or her twelve body parts." Then she takes clay of the river bank. And, moreover, she goes to the spring. And she crumbles one thin bread, and she takes it -- (namely) the mud of the spring. She scatters sweet oil cake and meal. And she libates wine and says:
8 "Just as you, O, spring, keep bubbling back up from the dark earth, in the same way, for the patient, from his or her limbs remove evil impurity." Then she takes clay of the spring. But while the wise woman is taking these things, meanwhile reed tents have been built previously beside the river. (The scribe:) "Where do they build them?" (The wise woman:) "Where there is no cultivation nearby, where the plow has not come, they build the tents there."
Grammar
41 Iteratives
Virtually every Hittite verb may make a formation called the iterative through the addition of a suffix to the verb stem. By far the most common suffix for forming iteratives was the suffix -ske-, -ska-, but a handful of verbs makes iteratives using the suffixes -anna- or -ssa-. These suffixes seem to be synonymous with the more frequent -ske-, -ska-. The general function of the iterative suffixes is to mark the action of the verb as extending over a noticeable period of time or as repeated. This general sense, however, is modified by the basic meaning of the verb and by context, in particular by accompanying adverbs. Iteratives may often be translated into English by "keeps on (doing something)" or, in the past tense, "kept on (doing something)," or "would (do something)" as in a sentence that describes a habitual action in the past like "He would eat pancakes for breakfast every Sunday."

41.1 Habitual activity
One use of the iterative is, indeed, to indicate that a particular activity is habitual. For example, in this passage from an Old Hittite text, the implication of the iterative hatreskezzi, iterative of hatrāi- 'write', is that one of the king's customary activities is to send written instructions to his noblemen, the LÚ.MEŠDUGUD. The iterative may be contrasted with the perfect hazzian harzi, which concerns a particular tablet that the king has had inscribed:

 	 	mān-smas	 	ABI	 	parnas-ma	 	tarna
 	 	when-you	 	father	 	to houses-but	 	lets go
 	 	nu-smas	 	mānhhanda	 	hatreskezzi	 	 
 	 	and-to	 	you	 	just as	 	he writes (iter.)
 	 	natta-smas	 	LÚ.ME^SDUGUD-as	 	tuppi	 	hazzian harzi
 	 	not-for you	 	dignitaries	 	tablet	 	written has
 	 	"When (my) father lets you go to (your) houses, just as he customarily writes to you, has he not inscribed a tablet for you dignitaries?"
In the "Law Code" and other texts, the adverb karū 'previously' is used with the iterative in the past tense to strengthen the idea that a particular penalty used to be the customary one:

 	 	takku	 	LÚ.U19.LU-as	 	SÀG.DU-ZU	 	kuiski	 	hūnikzi
 	 	if	 	of a person	 	head-his	 	someone	 	injures
 	 	karū	 	6	 	GÍN	 	KÙ.BABBAR	 	pisker
 	 	previously	 	six	 	shekels	 	silver	 	they used to give (iter.)
 	 	"Previously... they used to give six shekels of silver."
The following, from a spell recited by the ritual practitioner, Tunnawi, presents the action of a spring bubbling up mud as customary, or eternal:

 	 	zik-kan	 	mahhan	 	sakunis	 	GE6-az	 	KI-az	 	purut	 	EGIR
 	 	you-locatival	 	as	 	spring	 	from dark	 	from earth	 	mud	 	back
 	 	sarā sakuneskesi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	keep bubbling up (iter.)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as you, O spring, keep bubbling up mud from the dark earth..."
41.2 Extensive action
The iterative may be used for an action that is marked as extending over a continuous period of time. The action may be continuous, or it may be on-going but interrupted. Adverbs may be used to delimit the period of time during which the action is occurring, or to specify a particular time during which an action continues. An endpoint for the action may be specified or implied:

 	 	kī-ma-kan	 	tuppi	 	DUB.SAR	 	ANA	 	DINGIRLIM
 	 	this-but-locatival	 	tablet	 	scribe	 	before	 	deity
 	 	anda	 	UD-at UD-at	 	memiskezzi	 	 	 	 
 	 	to	 	daily	 	will read (iter.)	 	 	 	 
 	 	"This tablet the scribe shall read daily before the deity."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-us-kan	 	ishanas	 	DUTU	 	DIM-ni	 	paranta
 	 	and-them-locatival	 	of blood	 	Sungod	 	Stormgod	 	across
 	 	idalu	 	memisket	 	n-us	 	alwanzahhisket	 	 
 	 	unfavorably	 	kept speaking (iter.)	 	and-them	 	kept bewitching (iter.)	 	 
 	 	"He kept mentioning them unfavorably to the Sungod of Blood and the Stormgod, and he kept bewitching them."
The action of raising a child may be viewed as an ongoing one:

 	 	n-an	 	annisan-pat	 	ABU-YA	 	sallanusket
 	 	and-him	 	already-indeed	 	father-my	 	raised (iter.)
 	 	"And indeed, my father had already raised him."
Similarly, calling out "like a wolf" in a ritual is viewed as an on-going action, and the iterative of halzai- 'call out', which takes the suffix -ssa-, is used:

 	 	nu	 	UR.BAR.RA-ili	 	halzissai
 	 	and	 	in wolf fashion	 	calls out (iter.)
 	 	"He keeps calling out like a wolf."
In this passage from the "Law Code," the period of time during which a substitute keeps working in the house of someone who has been injured is limited by the phrase kuitmān-as lāzziatta 'until he (the victim) recovers'.

 	 	nu	 	Éri-ssi	 	anniskezzi	 	kuitmān-as	 	lāzziatta
 	 	and	 	in house-his	 	he keeps working (iter.)	 	until-he	 	recovers
 	 	"He (a substitute worker provide by the offender) keeps working in his (the victim's) house until he recovers."
41.3 Repeated action
The iterative may mark action performed on a series of objects. In other words, the action is viewed as repeated. The repeated actions may follow closely upon each other in time and space, or they may be separated temporally, spatially, or both.

In this passage, giving birth to a litter of piglets is viewed as a series of actions. Naturally, each birth follows relatively closely after the previous one:

 	 	nu-za	 	1	 	SAH	 	mahhan	 	SAH.TURHI.A	 	mekkus	 	haskezzi
 	 	and-reflexive	 	one	 	sow	 	just as	 	piglets	 	many	 	gives birth (iter.)
 	 	"Just as one sow gives birth to many piglets..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	MUNUS.ŠU.GI	 	DUGhupuwa-ya	 	hassi	 	anda	 	lahuskezzi
 	 	old woman	 	vessels-and	 	hearth	 	into	 	keeps pouring (iter.)
 	 	"And the old woman keeps emptying the vessels onto the hearth."
In the following, from a report to the king from a provincial outpost, the enemy's harvesting Hittite grain is viewed as a continuous action, though one that is necessarily distributed over time and space:

 	 	LÚKÚR-wa	 	pangarit	 	ispandaz	 	kuwapi	 	VI ME	 	LÚKÚR
 	 	enemy-quotative	 	in force	 	by night	 	in place	 	600	 	enemy
 	 	kuwapi-ma	 	IV ME	 	LÚKÚR	 	yattari	 	nu-wa-kan	 	 
 	 	in place-but	 	400	 	enemy	 	is marching	 	and-quotative-locatival	 	 
 	 	halkius	 	arha waraskezzi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	grain	 	lit. up-harvests (iter.)	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"The enemy is marching in force in the night -- in one place 600 enemy, in another 400 enemy, and they keep on harvesting the grain."
It has been claimed too that iteratives are used to mark actions performed by multiple subjects. The following sentence can be interpreted in this fashion:

 	 	1 LIM	 	MULHI.A	 	hukkuskanzi
 	 	1,000	 	stars	 	recite a spell (iter)
 	 	"The thousand stars are reciting a spell."
In this sentence, akkisk- the iterative of āk-, akk- 'die' is used impersonally of an action that was necessarily performed by many subjects during a plague:

 	 	nu-wa	 	PAN	 	ABI-YA	 	PAN	 	SEŠ-YA	 	akkisketat
 	 	and-quotative	 	under	 	father-my	 	under	 	brother-my	 	was repeated dying(iter.)
 	 	"Under my father (and) under my brother (i.e. during their reigns), there was repeated dying."
41.4 Inhibitive sense
When used in commands with the emphatic particle lē the iterative may have an inhibitive sense; in other words, the sense is "stop doing something that one has been continuously doing." In these two passages from letters written by scribes to other scribes, this use of the iterative lahlahhiske- 'keep on worrying' may be contrasted with the non-iterative form of the verb lahlahhiya- 'worry, be agitated'. In the first passage, the writer is telling his correspondent not to worry about the state of affairs in his household in Hattusas, an on-going situation. ŠEŠ.DÚG.GA-YA 'my dear brother' is a courtesy title, used by officials of equal rank:

 	 	kā-ya	 	INA	 	É-KA	 	hūman	 	SIG5-in
 	 	here-and	 	in	 	household	 	all	 	well
 	 	n-asta	 	ŠEŠ.DÚG.GA-YA	 	lē	 	kuwatqa	 	lahlahhiskesi
 	 	and-locatival	 	dear brother-my	 	not	 	in anyway	 	you keep worying (iter.)
 	 	"And here in your household everything is well. My dear brother, stop worrying in any way."
In this passage from the same letter, by contrast, the scribe is advised not to worry about another official who has been attacked by the enemy but is apparently unharmed. The use of the non-iterative form suggests that worrying is viewed here as an action that is not to be considered on-going:

 	 	MTahazzilinn-a	 	kuit	 	walhan harker	 	 
 	 	Tahhazili-and	 	because	 	he has been attacked	 	 
 	 	n-ssi	 	kāsa	 	LÚTEMI	 	awan arha wet
 	 	and-to-him	 	look	 	messenger	 	came away
 	 	SIG5-anza-war-ssi-kan	 	lē	 	kuwatqa	 	lahlahiyasi
 	 	well-quotative-to him-locatival	 	not	 	in any way	 	you worry
 	 	"And Tahazzili -- because they have attacked him -- look, (his) messenger came away (with the news) 'It is well with him.' Don't worry in any way."
41.5 The supine
Hittite has a construction with the so-called supine form in -wan plus a form of dāi- 'put' (or, less frequently, tiya- 'step', harpp- 'take to', or karpp- 'lift, undertake'). It is used to focus attention on an action's initiation and can usually be translated with "begin to..." Although the supine need not be made from the iterative stem, the iterative stem is used far more frequently in such constructions than the non-iterative stem:

 	 	nu-mu	 	ÉRINMEŠ	 	peskewan dāer
 	 	and-to me	 	troops	 	to give they began
 	 	"And they (a conquered city) started to give me troops."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	mahhan-ma	 	LÚMEŠ	 	URUAzzi	 	auer	 	URUDIDLI.HI.A	 	BÀD-kan
 	 	when-but	 	people	 	of Azzi	 	saw	 	cities	 	fortified
 	 	kuit	 	zahhiyaz	 	katta daskeuwan tehhun	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	that	 	in battle	 	I had begun to take	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"But when the people of Azzi saw that I had started taking fortified cities in battle..."
In the following, the expression meaning "become a god" is used of a king's dying:

 	 	LÚ.ŠU.GI	 	kisat	 	n-as	 	DINGIRLIM-is	 	kikkiskewan dais
 	 	old man	 	became	 	and-he	 	god	 	began to become
 	 	"He became an old man and began to become a god (i.e. 'started dying')."
The use of the supine construction in this sentence implies that the dream began to recur:

 	 	nu-mu	 	asi	 	memiyas	 	teshaniskewan tiyat
 	 	and-to-me	 	the aforementioned	 	mattter	 	began to appear in a dream
 	 	"And the aforementioned matter began to appear to me in a dream."
41b Questions
The scribes who wrote the Hittite documents did not use punctuation or any other special means to indicate questions. Questions that demand and answer "yes" or "no" are of the same syntactic form as statements. Presumably they were distinguished from statements in speech by intonation. The lack of punctuation means that the modern reader often has to infer that a sentence is a question from the context. Doing so is especially difficult, not only because of the lack of punctuation, which makes it difficult to determine whether a sentence is intended as a yes/no question, but also because the interrogative and relative pronouns and adverbs were identical.

41b.1 Yes/No and Rhetorical Questions
On the one hand, determining whether a sentence is intended as a yes/no question is complicated by the fact that the Hittites were especially fond of rhetorical questions. On the other hand, the fact that a sentence seems to express a sentiment that might seem redundant, out of place, or peculiar in context may be a clue that it is to be interpreted as a rhetorical question.

This sentence, for example, if interpreted as a statement, would indicate that the speaker is condoning murder:

 	 	ēshar	 	INA	 	KUR	 	URUKÙ.BABBAR-ti	 	āra
 	 	bloodshed	 	in	 	country	 	Hatti	 	right
 	 	"Is bloodshed in Hatti right?"
This question comes from a letter from a Hittite king to an Assyrian king. Since there are no historical grounds for assuming that the two kings were brothers, the intent is presumably sarcastic:

 	 	zik-za-kan	 	ammuk-a	 	1-edani	 	AMA-ni	 	hassantes
 	 	you-reflexive-locatival	 	I-and	 	to one	 	to mother	 	born
 	 	"Were you and I born of one mother?"
This rhetorical question from "The Apology of Hattusilis III" comes at a point in the document when Hattusilis has been complaining about how he has been treated by Urhi-Teshup, the king he installed after the death of Muwatallis, and just before he describes the battle in which he deposes Urhi-Teshup. The tone can be interpreted as self-justifying:

 	 	n-an-kan	 	ANA	 	GIŠGIGIR	 	waggariyanun
 	 	and-him-locatival	 	in	 	chariot	 	I rebelled
 	 	nasma-an-kan	 	ŠA	 	É-TI	 	waggariyanun
 	 	or-him-locatival	 	of	 	house	 	I rebelled
 	 	"Did I rebel against him in the chariot (i.e. 'as a military commander'), or did I rebel against him in the house (i.e. in a palace conspiracy)?"
The rhetorical question may provide its own grounds in the form of a conditional, temporal, or contrary-to-fact clause. The following is a quotation from a letter from the widow of the Egyptian pharoah Tuthankamen, who has been corresponding with Suppiluliuma I asking him to send one of his sons to be her new husband:

 	 	DUMU.LUGAL-man-wa	 	kuwapi	 	ēsta	 	 
 	 	prince-irrealis-quotative	 	anywhere	 	was	 	 
 	 	anzas-man-wa	 	damedani	 	KUR-e	 	uwawen
 	 	we-irrealis-quotative	 	to another	 	to country	 	we came
 	 	mān-wa-nas	 	anzel	 	BELI	 	wesiskewen
 	 	if-quotative-to us	 	of us	 	lord	 	we kept requesting
 	 	"If we had a prince (suitable for marriage) anywhere, would we have come to a foreign land and kept requesting a lord for ourselves?"
Questions that are negated are often rhetorical questions that demand "yes" as an answer. In such questions, the negation is often, though not inevitably, the first word in its clause. The following is from a text sent by a Hittite prince to noblemen reminding them of their duty to protect the people:

 	 	mān-smas	 	ABI	 	parnas-ma	 	tarna
 	 	when-you	 	father	 	to houses-but	 	lets go
 	 	nu-smas	 	mānhhanda	 	hatreskezzi	 	 
 	 	and-to you	 	just as	 	he writes (iter.)	 	 
 	 	natta-smas	 	LÚ.ME^SDUGUD-as	 	tuppi	 	hazzian harzi
 	 	not-for you	 	dignitaries	 	tablet	 	written has
 	 	"When (my) father lets you go to (your) houses, just as he customarily writes to you, has he not inscribed a tablet for you dignitaries?"
In the following question, however, the negation comes within the clause:

 	 	man	 	zik	 	ŪL	 	arsaniese
 	 	irrealis	 	you	 	not	 	be upset
 	 	"Wouldn't you be upset?"
In questions, negatives reinforced by kuiski 'someone, anyone' or the adverb imma 'indeed, surely' are not normally clause initial:

 	 	nu-wa-ta	 	ŪL	 	imma	 	pehhi	 	pehhi-ta
 	 	and-quotative-to you	 	not	 	indeed	 	I give	 	I give-to you
 	 	"Won't I indeed give (it) to you? I (surely) will give (it) to you!"
In order to determine the causes of troubles or to make decisions about future actions, the Hittites routinely employed various kinds of oracles, many of which contain an exacting series of yes/no questions. Therefore, oracle texts, of which many are preserved, are good places to find such questions. The following is from an oracle about the possible causes of a god's anger:

 	 	DINGIR-LUM-za	 	kidas	 	waskuwas	 	ser	 	TUKU.TUKU-wanza
 	 	deity-reflexive	 	these	 	sins	 	over	 	angered
 	 	"Is the god angry on account of these sins?"
42 Questions with Interrogative Pronouns, Adjectives, and Adverbs
As in English, questions that demand information rather than a yes/no answer are made with interrogative pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs. The interrogatives from the stem kui- have the same forms as the relative pronouns. Similarly, the rarer stem masi- is shared by relatives and interrogatives. Often, the interrogative word is the first word in the question:

 	 	kuis-war-as-kan	 	kuenta
 	 	who-quotative-them-locatival	 	killed
 	 	"Who killed them?"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuit	 	iyanun	 	kuit
 	 	what	 	I did	 	what
 	 	"What have I done? What?"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuit-wa	 	wastul-tit
 	 	what-quotative	 	sin-your
 	 	"What is your sin?"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuedani-wa-za	 	menahhanda	 	ishamiskesi
 	 	whom-quotative-reflexive	 	before	 	you are singing
 	 	"Before whom are you singing?"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuwat-war-an	 	parā ŪL pesti
 	 	why-quotative-him	 	over not you give
 	 	"Why didn't you hand him over?"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuwapit	 	armenun
 	 	where	 	we have come
 	 	"To where have we come?"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	DIM-as	 	DNIN.TU-ni	 	tet	 	mahhan	 	iyaweni
 	 	Stormgod	 	to Hanannana	 	said	 	how	 	we act
 	 	"The Stormgod said to Hannahanna, 'How shall we act?' (i.e., 'What shall we do?')"
The interrogative word does not always come at the front of the question clause, however. Certain elements, such as verbs or adverbial phrases, may be moved to the front for emphasis.

 	 	nu-wa-mu	 	iwaru	 	kuit	 	pāi
 	 	and-quotative-to me	 	dowry	 	what	 	he gives
 	 	"What dowry will he give me?"
Questions in the form of nominal sentences with the interrogative kuit 'what' following the demonstrative pronoun kī are quite common:

 	 	kī	 	kuit
 	 	this	 	what
 	 	"What is this?"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	zik-wa-kan	 	apūn	 	anda	 	kuwat	 	austa
 	 	you-quotative-locatival	 	that (woman)	 	at	 	why	 	you looked
 	 	"Why did you look at that (woman)?"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu-wa	 	wattaru	 	māhhan	 	iyan
 	 	and-quotative	 	fountain	 	how	 	is made
 	 	"How is the fountain made?"
In the following exchange from the "Ritual of Tuwanni," the scribe who is taking the ritual from dictation questions the ritual practitioner about the location of the tent that is built for the ritual. The fact that the sentence is followed by a statement specifying a type of location indicates that it is a question.

Scribe:

 	 	iyanzi-ma	 	kuwapi
 	 	they make-but	 	where
 	 	"Where do they make (the tent?)"
Tunnawi:

 	 	nu	 	kuwapi	 	harsauwar	 	maninkuwan	 	NU.GÁL	 	GIŠAPIN	 	UL	 	aranza
 	 	and	 	where	 	cultivation	 	nearby	 	there is not	 	plow	 	not	 	arrived
 	 	nu	 	GIŠZA.LAM.GAR	 	apiya	 	iyanzi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	and	 	tent	 	there	 	they make	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Where there is no cultivation nearby, (where) the plow has not come; they make the hut there."
Like kui-, the pronoun masi- is used in questions. The following, for example, is a rhetorical question, asked by King Hattusilis I, who is is recounting the aftermath of a rebellion:

 	 	nu	 	masiēs	 	MUHI.A	 	pāer	 	masiess-a-kan	 	huwāer
 	 	and	 	how many	 	years	 	have gone	 	how many-and-locatival	 	ran
 	 	"How many years have passed, and how many (of the offenders) have escaped (retribution)?"
43 Infinitives
Hittite has two infinitive forms, both of which may be active or passive in sense. One, in -ānna, is made from athematic verbs of the mi-conjugation that show an alternation, called ablaut, in the vowels of their roots, e.g. adānna 'to eat' from ēd-, ad- 'eat', or huganna 'to recite a spell' from hwēk-, huk- 'strike'. The verb aus- 'see', which is mostly inflected as a hi-conjugation verb, but which makes the mi-conjugation third person singular present, preterite, and imperatives auszi, austa, and ausdu also make an infinitive in -ānna, uwanna. All other verbs, whether mi-conjugation or hi-conjugation, make an infinitive in -wanzi. The infinitives of verbs in stem final u- have the shape -manzi (or -mannzi), since a sequence u plus w regularly becomes um, for example the infinitive of wahnu- 'make turn' is wahnumanzi, and the infinitive of sallanu- 'raise, make big' is sallanummanzi. Both types of infinitive have the same functions.

43.1 Purpose or goal
As in English, the Hittite infinitive may express a purpose or goal:

 	 	INA	 	KUR	 	URULawzantiya	 	ANA	 	DINGIRLIM	 	BAL-uwanzi	 	iyahhahat
 	 	to	 	country	 	Lawanzantiyas	 	to	 	deity	 	to sacrifice (inf.)	 	I went
 	 	"I went to the country of Lawanzantiyas to sacrifice to the deity."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nu	 	EN.SISKUR	 	warpuwanzi	 	paizzi
 	 	and	 	patient	 	to wash (inf.)	 	goes
 	 	"The patient goes to wash."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-as	 	ÍD-i	 	arrumanzi	 	pehudanzi
 	 	and-them	 	to the river	 	to be washed (inf.)	 	they take
 	 	"They take them to the river to be washed."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	annissan-pat-an	 	MNIR.GÁL-is	 	LUGAL-us	 	ANA	 	ABU-YA
 	 	before-already-him	 	Muwattallis	 	king	 	to	 	father-my
 	 	MHattusli	 	sallanummanzi	 	piyan harta	 	 	 	 
 	 	Hattusilis	 	to raise (inf.)	 	given had	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Already before, the king, Muwattalli, had given him to Hattusili to raise."
43.2 Infinitive as object
The infinitive may be the object of some verbs. For example, wek- 'ask for, demand' often takes the infinitive akuwanna 'to drink' in ritual texts:

 	 	LÚSANGA	 	akuwanna	 	wekzi
 	 	priest	 	to drink (inf.)	 	asks
 	 	"The priest asks to drink"
An infinitive is often the object of sanh- 'seek' in the sense 'try'.

 	 	1-as 1-an	 	kunanna	 	lē	 	sanhanzi
 	 	one another	 	to kill (inf.)	 	not	 	seek
 	 	"One should not seek to kill another."
Mazz-, which otherwise means 'endure, withstand', means 'dare' with the infinitive:

 	 	mān	 	apās-ma	 	memiyauwanzi	 	ŪL	 	mazzazzi
 	 	if	 	he-but	 	to tell (inf.)	 	not	 	dare
 	 	"But if he doesn't dare to tell..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	uwanna	 	ŪL	 	mazatti
 	 	to look (inf.)	 	not	 	you dare
 	 	"You don't dare to look."
43.3 Infinitive with object
The infinitive itself may take a direct object:

 	 	apās-ma-mu	 	harkanna	 	sanhta
 	 	he-but-me	 	to destroy (inf.)	 	he sought
 	 	"He sought to destroy me."
43.4 Adverbial infinitives
Infinitives may also be used adverbially. In the following, liliwahhnuwani is the infinitive of the verb liliwahh- 'move swiftly':

 	 	mahhan-ta	 	kās	 	tuppianza	 	anda wemiyazzi	 	 
 	 	as soon as-you	 	this	 	tablet	 	reaches	 	 
 	 	nu	 	MAHAR	 	DUTUŠI	 	liliwannuwanzi	 	ūnni
 	 	and	 	before	 	my majesty	 	in a hurry	 	drive
 	 	"As soon as this tablet reaches you, travel to my majesty in a hurry ."
44 N-stem and S-stem Nouns
Hittite preserves a number of nouns with archaic inflection and stems in -n- or -s-. Both sorts of declension, though inherited from Indo-European, are quite rare.

44.1 N-stems
The neuter nouns lāman 'name' and tēkan 'earth' preserve an archaic inflection in which both the shape of the root and the shape of the suffix change according to case form. In lāman a stem lām-an in the nominative-accusative alternates with a stem lam-n- in the other cases, and in the word for 'earth' the nominative-accusative tēk-an alternates with a stem tag-ān in the locative and a stem tak-n- in the other cases:

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	lāman	 	tēkan
gen.	 	lam-n-as	 	tak-n-ās
dat.	 	lam-n-i	 	tak-n-ī
loc.	 	 	 	tagān
abl.	 	*lam-n-az	 	tak-n-āz
inst.	 	lam-n-it	 	 
all.	 	 	 	tak-n-ā
Plural	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	 	 	 
acc.	 	 	 	 
gen.	 	 	 	 
dat/loc.	 	lam-n-as	 	 
Animate n-stems, for example kutruwa-, kutruwen- 'witness' and ishimā-, ishimān- 'cord, rope', are inflected partially as a-stems and partially as n-stems. The suffix of the former noun is wen- and the suffix of the latter noun is -mān-. The a-stem forms of these animate nouns were probably formed on the model of the nominatives, in which earlier forms of the suffixes were *-wan-s and *-man-s and the original *n was lost before the animate ending -s by regular sound change. The neuter n-stem sahhan 'feudal service', by contrast, is of a type in which neither the root sahh- nor the suffix -an- changes shape according to case.

Singular	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	kutr-uwa-s	 	ishi-mā-s	 	sahhan
acc.	 	 	 	ishi-man-an	 	sahhan
gen.	 	 	 	 	 	sahhan-as
dat/loc.	 	kutr-u-i	 	 	 	sahhan-i
abl.	 	 	 	ishi-man-az	 	sahhan-az
inst.	 	 	 	ishi-man-da	 	sahhan-it
all.	 	 	 	 	 	 
Plural	 	 	 	 	 	 
nom.	 	kutr-uwen-es	 	ishi-mān-es	 	 
acc.	 	kutrūs	 	ishi-mān-us	 	 
gen.	 	 	 	 	 	 
dat/loc.	 	 	 	 	 	 
44.2 S-stems
A handful of Hittite nouns have stems that end in vowel plus -s. Perhaps the most common of these is the neuter noun nēpis 'heaven'. This noun shows an invariant stem nēpis throughout its paradigm. In the paradigm of the neuter s-stem āis 'mouth', however, the stem āis- in the nominative-accusative singular, alternates with a stem iss- elsewhere in the paradigm. Both nouns are attested only in the singular.

Singular	 	 	 	 
nom/acc.	 	nēpis	 	āis
gen.	 	nēpis-as	 	*iss-ās
dat-loc.	 	nēpis-i	 	iss-ī
abl.	 	nēpis-az	 	iss-āz
inst.	 	 	 	*iss-it
all.	 	nēpis-a	 	iss-ā
45 Postpositions
In Hittite the function words that are the equivalent of English, Latin, or Greek prepositions normally come after the nouns which they govern. The technical term for such a function word that follows its noun is postposition. Like prepositions, postpositions generally specify spatial or temporal relations, though they may also take on less concrete meanings. Many postpositions also function as adverbs or as preverbs. We find a comparable situation in English, for example in the use of the English function word 'down' in "down the river" (preposition); "she tossed the ball down" (adverb); and "she lived her reputation down" (verbal particle). As in Latin and Greek, Hittite postpositions cause the nouns they govern to take specific case forms, and many postpositions may take more than one case form.

For example, mēnahhanda 'facing, against, opposite' usually takes a dative-locative:

 	 	na-as-kan	 	LUGAL-i	 	menahhanda	 	tiyazi
 	 	and-he-locatival	 	the king (dat-loc)	 	opposite	 	steps
 	 	"He takes a position opposite the king."
The postpositions istarna 'in the midst of, among', tapusza 'alongside (of)', and andurza 'inside (of)' may take a noun in the dative-locative. Since many actions in rituals involve the hearth, one finds these postpositions with the word for 'hearth'.

 	 	hassi	 	istarna	 	pēdi
 	 	hearth (dat-loc.)	 	in the midst of	 	in place
 	 	"in a place in the midst of the hearth"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	hassī	 	tapusza
 	 	hearth (dat-loc.)	 	alongside
 	 	"alongside the hearth"
This phrase uses the Sumerogram GUNNI plus phonetic complement for dative-locative hassī 'hearth':

 	 	GUNNI-si	 	andurza
 	 	hearth (dat-loc.)	 	inside
 	 	"inside the hearth"
Tapusza may also take a noun in the genitive:

 	 	parsulli	 	hassās	 	tapusza
 	 	bread crumbs	 	of the hearth (gen.)	 	alongside
 	 	"bread crumbs alongside of the hearth"
The postposition pēran 'before' may take the accusative:

 	 	hāssan	 	pēran	 	dāi
 	 	the hearth (acc.)	 	before	 	he places
 	 	"He places (it) before the hearth."
It may also take the genitive, however:

 	 	t-an	 	hassās	 	pēran	 	tiyanzi
 	 	and-it	 	hearth (gen.)	 	before	 	they place
 	 	"They place it before the hearth."
The postpositions hānda and handas 'for the sake of, because of, out of regard for' are normally followed by a noun in the dative:

 	 	āssiyanni	 	handas
 	 	of love (dat.-loc)	 	for the sake
 	 	"for the sake of love"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ŠA	 	ŠEŠ-YA	 	nakkiyanni	 	handas
 	 	of	 	brother-my	 	importance (dat-loc.)	 	out of regard for
 	 	"out of regard for my brother's importance"
In this phrase, the Akkadian preposition ANA signals that the following noun is to be understood as a dative:

 	 	ANA	 	ŠEŠ-YA	 	handas
 	 	dative	 	my brother (dat.-loc)	 	out of consideration
 	 	"out of consideration for my brother"
With many postpositions, differences in the case of the preceding noun may contribute to subtle differences in meaning. The preverbs āppa and āppan, 'following, after, behind', for example, often take the genitive:

 	 	attas-mas	 	āppan
 	 	father-my (gen.)	 	after
 	 	"after my father"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	kuis	 	ammel	 	āppan	 	LUGAL-us	 	kīsari
 	 	who	 	me (gen.)	 	after	 	king	 	becomes
 	 	"who becomes king after me..."
But āppa may also take the ablative, the case of separation, as in:

 	 	tuzziyaz	 	āppa
 	 	army (abl.)	 	behind
 	 	"behind the army"
katta, and kattan, meaning 'down, below, under' can take the genitive:

 	 	hassās	 	katta	 	edi	 	parsanān harzi
 	 	hearth (gen.)	 	down by	 	there	 	squatted he has
 	 	"He has squatted there down by the hearth."
But with the dative-locative, the meaning is 'located under':

 	 	GIŠBANŠUR-i	 	katta
 	 	table (dat.-loc)	 	under
 	 	"under the table"
With the ablative, the meaning is 'down from' as in:

 	 	URU-az	 	katta
 	 	from the city (abl.)	 	down
 	 	"down from the city"
With the dative-locative anda and andan mean 'into', for example:

 	 	É-ri	 	anda
 	 	the house (dat.)	 	into
 	 	"into the house"
Used with the genitive, however, they mean 'in' or 'at':

 	 	istananas	 	anda	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	wisūriyanantati
 	 	altars (gen.)	 	at	 	gods	 	were stifled
 	 	"At (their) altars the gods were stifled."
The postposition iwar 'like' is used with the genitive in similies:

 	 	nu-za	 	LÚMEŠ	 	huelpi	 	GA.RASSAR	 	iwar	 	arha karapta
 	 	and-reflexive	 	men	 	fresh	 	leek (gen.)	 	like	 	you eat up
 	 	"You eat up men like (one would eat up) a fresh leek."
The word mān, which has a number of other functions, may be used as a postposition following a genitive with the sense 'like' in similies:

 	 	suminzan-a	 	ÌRMEŠ-am-man	 	UR.BAR.RA-as	 	mān	 	pangur	 	I-EN	 	ēstu
 	 	your-but	 	servants-my	 	of the wolf (gen.)	 	like	 	clan	 	one	 	let be
 	 	"Let your clan, my servants, be united like (that) of the wolf."
The closely related māhhan may also be used as a postposition meaning 'like':

 	 	nu-war-as	 	arha	 	dannarus	 	DUGUTÚLHI.A	 	mahhan
 	 	and-quotative-them	 	away	 	empty	 	vessels	 	like
 	 	duwarniskesi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	you will keep breaking	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"You will keep breaking them up like empty vessels."
45.1 Frozen case forms
Etymologically, many postpositions are frozen case forms of nouns; tapusza and andurza, for example, are from ablatives. Postpositions formed from different case forms may have somewhat different meanings. For example, katta and kattan normally mean 'down', but the related katti means 'with'. The postposition sēr, formed from the endingless locative of an old noun, retains its locatival sense and means 'upon' or 'up upon' as in:

 	 	HUR.SAG-i	 	sēr
 	 	mountain (loc.)	 	upon
 	 	"upon the mountain"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	suhhi	 	sēr
 	 	roof (loc.)	 	up upon
 	 	"up upon the roof"
The related sarā 'up', which is formed from an old allative, and is used with both the dative-locative and the allative, however, often has the sense of 'up to':

 	 	HUR.SAG-i	 	sarā
 	 	mountain (dat.-loc)	 	up to
 	 	"Up to the mountain"
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	suhha	 	sarā
 	 	roof (all.)	 	up to
 	 	"up to the roof"
45.2 With enclitic pronouns
When used with enclitic pronouns, the postpositions, as independently accented words, naturally precede the pronouns they govern:

katti-mmi 'with me'
katti-tti 'with you'
sēr-smet 'over them' (spelled se-e-er-sa-me-et)
pēan-ttit 'in front of you'
In early texts, the final -n- of pēran may become m before the initial m of the first person singular enclitic pronoun (i.e. pēram-mit for pēram-mit) or it may be lost before the initial s of the third person singular and second and third person plural pronouns (i.e. pērasset for pēran-sset).

Lesson 10
Sara E. Kimball, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
The festival texts make up the largest group of tablets found at Boğazköy. Stereotyped, they describe in detail the rituals that must be carried out at a given festival. They also include information of importance for reconstructing the history of the Hittites, such as lists of place names, and data on the gods and the functionaries in the various cults. The texts are lengthy; those for the KI.LAM festival, "The Festival of the Gate-House," make up more than 12 tablets, while the purulli festival is recorded in 32. They are also of importance for determining changes in the Hittite language over time, as well as supplies for the participants in the festival, such as their rations of food, their festive garments, and their ornaments. For the KI.LAM festival the priest selects 4 sheep on the first day, and again on the third, leading to a total of more than 120. Similar information is included for bread and beverages, as well as for the clothing and ornaments, some of which have not been identified. The participants are also identified by types, such as priests of the various deities and cities, and cult functionaries in addition to men and women of the town. Much of this information still remains to be assembled and published.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The sections from the description of the KI.LAM festival that are presented here are self-explanatory. The first provides information on the participants and their functions. The remainder list the procedures as the king and queen proceed from their palace to the site of the ceremony. The central features of the ceremony in the procession viewed by the king, first at the palace gate and then at the upper gate of the gods, consisted of cult objects. The priest of KAL is followed by "the spears," the "copper fleeces," and the animals of the gods; these are metal figures, including a silver panther, a silver wolf, a golden lion, a lapis lazuli boar, a silver boar and a silver bear. They in turn are followed by the "god-men," metal figures of the stags, and birds of ivory. Further ceremonies include the race of the runners, who bring a libation vessel to the king. This is filled with wine, which the king then pours into the hands of the priests, who are mentioned in the lists of garments given them. Thereupon the king and the queen ride in a chariot to various houses and temples, finally to the ceremonial tent of the Storm-god where a "Great Assembly" is held at which 40 different gods are worshipped, as by drinking to them. Finally the king and queen return to the palace, entering through the palace gate.

Translation
22 To the accompaniment of the large INANNA-lyre, the singers sing, the comedian speaks, the applauders applaud, (and) the reciter recites. The cupbearer brings one sour thick bread from the gate/outside. He gives it to the king (and) the king crumbles (it). The cupbearer holds out a thick loaf to the king and he (the cupbearer) takes (it) away.
1 When the king comes from the palace complex, he goes to the tents; and the king (and) queen seat themselves. The Son of the Palace of the Gold Spear steps in. With his hand, he holds the lituus and the towel of the golden spear. He comes(?) and gives the towel to the king, but the lituus he sets down at the throne. The Son of the Palace again steps in front of the king. He holds the golden spear. He calls out "kassmissa!"
24 And the chief of the bodyguard marches in front and he steps facing the king. And two Sons of the Palace take hand-water to the king and queen with a gold bowl. The Son of the Palace of the Gold Spear steps to the left of the two Sons of the Palace of the Vessel. The chief of the Sons of the Palace holds out a linen towel to them (the king and queen). And when he approaches the throne, then the Son of the Palace of the Gold Spear steps back. And 2 Sons of the Palace hold out water for the hands of the king and queen. And the king and queen wash their hands and they (the Sons of the Palace) take (it) away.
12 And the king throws the towel away. If he throws it among the bodyguards, the bodyguards from where they have been squatting pick it up, and the bodyguards take it away. But if he throws it among the Sons of the Palace, the Sons of the Palace from where they have been squatting pick it up, and they take it away and give it to the Men of the Table.
Grammar
46 Negatives
Hittite has two widely used negative particles. One, natta, can be considered the general negative. The other, lē, which was rarer, was an emphatic negative, used in expressing strong wishes or commands.

46.1 Emphatic negative
The emphatic negative could be used, at least in early texts, in commands with the imperative. It could also be used with verbs in the indicative to express strong wishes in texts from all periods.

 	 	lē-ta	 	nāhi
 	 	negative-yourself	 	fear (imp.)
 	 	"Don't fear for yourself."
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	memiyann-a-ssi	 	lē	 	mematti
 	 	word-but-to her	 	not	 	you speak
 	 	"And you should not speak a word to her."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ehu-wa	 	īt	 	kuwapi-wa	 	paisi
 	 	come on-quotative	 	go	 	where-quotative	 	you go
 	 	ammuk-ma-wa-tta	 	lē	 	saggahhi	 	 
 	 	I-and-quotative-you	 	not	 	know	 	 
 	 	"Go! And I don't want to know where you go!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-asta	 	lē	 	āssawēs	 	id:lauwas	 	anda harkanzi
 	 	and-locatival	 	not	 	good	 	bad	 	perish together with
 	 	"Let not the good people perish together with the bad."
With a verb in the second or third person iterative le: can be translated as "stop" doing the action conveyed by the iterative:

 	 	lē	 	kuwatqa	 	lahlahhiskesi
 	 	not	 	in any way	 	keep worrying
 	 	"You should stop worrying in any way."
46.2 General particle natta
By far the more common negative particle, however, was the general particle natta. It is usually written out as na-at-ta in the earliest Old Hittite texts, but in later texts, the syllabic spelling is normally replaced by the Akkadogram ŪL, which was read as natta. Natta normally occurs before the part of the clause that is negated. So-called "double negatives" are perfectly grammatical in Hittite.

Natta may negate the entire predicate of a sentence of a sentence, or a noun that is part of the predicate:

 	 	takku	 	natta-ma	 	taranzi	 	nu	 	natta	 	paimi
 	 	if	 	not-but	 	they say	 	then	 	not	 	I go
 	 	"But if they don't say, I will not go."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	eter	 	n-e	 	ŪL	 	ispiēr
 	 	they	 	ate	 	not	 	were satiated
 	 	"They ate, (and) they were not satiated."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	kussan-a	 	natta	 	piyan
 	 	if	 	wage-but	 	not	 	paid
 	 	"But if the wage is not paid..."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	lalesmess-a	 	ŪL	 	siyānza
 	 	the invoice-and	 	not	 	sealed
 	 	"And the invoice was not sealed."
In the following the direct object or one of its modifiers is negated:

 	 	ŪL	 	pittuliantan-ma	 	anda warpiskesi
 	 	not	 	intimidated-but	 	you enclose
 	 	"You enclose even the unintimidated."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	qāsa-smas-kan	 	parkuin	 	misriwantan	 	harkin	 	 
 	 	look-to you-locatival	 	pure	 	perfect	 	white	 	 
 	 	GIŠPA-it	 	ŪL	 	walhantan	 	UDU-un	 	sipantahhun
 	 	with a stick	 	not	 	struck	 	sheep	 	I offer
 	 	"Look, I am offering you (as sacrifice) a pure, perfect, white, never-struck with a stick sheep."
The subject or one of its modifiers can also be negated:

 	 	natta-an	 	ūk	 	tarnahhun
 	 	not-it	 	I	 	released
 	 	"It wasn't I who released it."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ektas-ma-du-ssan	 	erhaz	 	ŪL	 	nahsariyauwanza	 	arha	 	ŪL	 	wezzi
 	 	net-but-you-locatival	 	circle	 	not	 	afraid	 	out	 	not	 	comes
 	 	"Even the unafraid will not come out of the circle of your net."
46.3 Indefinite pronouns and adverbs
Indefinite pronouns and adverbs can be negated, for example natta kuiski means 'no one', natta kuitki means 'nothing', natta kuatqa means 'in no way', and natta kuwappiki means 'in no way, at no time, never':

 	 	nu-wa	 	ŪL kuitki	 	sakti
 	 	and-quotative	 	nothing	 	you know
 	 	"You know nothing."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ANA	 	M.DLAMMMA-ma-kan	 	wastul	 	ŪL kuitki	 	āsta
 	 	to	 	Kurunta-but-locatival	 	fault	 	not any	 	remained
 	 	"No fault whatsoever attached to (lit. 'remained with') Kurunta."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	M.DLAMMA-as-ma-kan	 	ŪL kuwappiki	 	anda	 	ēsta
 	 	Kurunta-but-locatival	 	in no way	 	in	 	was
 	 	"Kurunta was in no way involved (in the insurrection)."
46.4 Negative adverb nāwi
The negative adverb nāwi means 'not yet'. When nāwi is used with a verb in the present tense, the sentence or clause in which it occurs is to be translated by the English present perfect:

 	 	mān-kan	 	DSIN	 	nawi	 	ūpzi
 	 	if-locatival	 	the moon	 	not yet	 	rises
 	 	"If the moon has not yet risen..."
When nāwi is used with a verb in the past tense, the sentence should be translated by the Engish past perfect:

 	 	EGIR-izzi-ma-ssi	 	TUPPU	 	nāwi	 	wemiyawen
 	 	last-but-to it	 	tablet	 	not yet	 	found
 	 	"We had not yet found its final tablet (i.e. the final tablet of a multi-tablet composition)."
46.5 Adverb nūmān
The adverb nūmān, which is a compound whose second element is probably related to the irrealis particle man, is used with negative wishes, for example:

 	 	n-e	 	namma	 	hattesnas	 	kattanda nūmān pānzi
 	 	and-they	 	moreover	 	to holes	 	down not they go
 	 	"And they (snakes) do not want to go back down into (their) holes again."
47 Local Adverbs and Preverbs
Hittite has a handful of function words that may act as postpositions (function words that are comparable to English prepositions), as adverbs specifying location, and as preverbs, words that modify verbs. As adverbs, anda 'into', āppa 'after(wards), behind', arha 'outward, away', katta 'downward', parā 'forward, forth, further', and sarā 'upward' indicate movement in a particular direction. The related adverbs āppan 'behind, after(wards)', kattan 'at the side', pēran 'before, in front, previously' and sēr 'upon', tend to indicate location in relation to a particular position. Āppa and āppan are often written with the Sumerogram EGIR with or without phonetic complement, while pēran may be written with the Akkadograms PANI or MAHAR. The adverbs may be used of spatial, temporal, or logical relationships, for example:

 	 	DINGIRDIDLI.HI.A-s-a	 	DUMUMEŠ-us	 	A.AB.BA-az	 	sarā	 	dāer
 	 	gods-but	 	children	 	out of the sea	 	up	 	they took
 	 	"But the gods took the boys up out of the sea."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	aniūr-kan	 	EGIR-an	 	iyanzi
 	 	ritual-locatival	 	again	 	they do
 	 	"They perform the ritual again."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	āppa-ma	 	URUDalawas	 	kūrur	 	IṢBAT
 	 	afterwards-but	 	city of Dalawa	 	hostilities	 	took
 	 	"But afterwards, the city of Dalawa took up hostilities."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ammuk-at	 	kattan	 	lahhi	 	iyantat-pat
 	 	me-they	 	together	 	to war	 	they went-indeed
 	 	"Together with me they indeed went to war."
47.1 Compound Verbs
Combinations of preverb plus verb may be considered compound verbs. As preverbs, these words modify the sense of the verbs in much the same way that function words like "in," "up," or "down" modify the sense of the verb in English phrasal verbs like "fill in (a form)" (compare "fill"), "give up" 'surrender' (compare "give"), "put down" 'insult someone' (compare "put"). Preverbs tend to precede the verbs they modify as closely as possible, and in most instances, the preverb comes immediately before the verb. As with English phrasal verbs, the meaning of the preverb plus verb combination may be fairly close to the meaning of the uncompounded verb or it may be may be idiomatic and not entirely predictable from the literal meanings of the elements of the compound.

Sometimes, the addition of the preverb simply makes the meaning of the verb more emphatic. For example, the verb karap- means 'eat, devour'. With arha the sense is more akin to English 'eat up':

 	 	nu-za	 	LÚMEŠ	 	huelpi	 	GA.RASSAR	 	iwar	 	arha karapta
 	 	and-reflexive	 	men	 	fresh	 	leek (gen.)	 	like	 	you eat up
 	 	"You eat up men like (one would eat up) a fresh leek."
The verb huwāi- means 'run, march, go'. When used with the preverb pēran 'in front, before' it can have the literal meaning 'run in front' or it can have the figurative meanings 'lead' or 'help, support'. The compund pēran huwāi- normally takes a dative object.

 	 	nu	 	DUTUŠI	 	ANA	 	KARAŠHI.A	 	G\R-it	 	peran hūiyanun
 	 	and	 	my majesty	 	dative	 	army	 	on foot	 	marched-before
 	 	"And I, my majesty, marched before the army on foot."
The phrase pēran huwāi- is often used of the gods supporting the king or his troops in battle:

 	 	nu-nnas	 	DINGIRMEŠ	 	peran hūwaēr	 	 
 	 	and-us	 	gods	 	before-ran	 	 
 	 	nu	 	ÉRINMEŠ	 	LÚKÚR	 	hullumen
 	 	and	 	troops	 	enemy	 	we defeated
 	 	"The gods supported us, and we defeated the enemy troops."
The basic meaning of pēssiya- is 'throw', though it can have metaphorical meanings such as 'waive' or 'disregard'. With the preverb arha, however, it can take on a variety of meanings, including 'reject' or 'repudiate':

 	 	nu	 	apūn	 	MĀMĒTUM	 	arha pessiyatten
 	 	and	 	that	 	oath	 	away-throw
 	 	"Repudiate that oath."
The compound verb pēran weriya- with the reflexive particle -za means 'involve oneself with'. In the following sentence, a nominal sentence made with the participle, the negative adverb lē separates the preverb from the verb:

 	 	ANA	 	LÚ.ME^S	 	URUMira-ma-wa-za	 	peran lē weriyanza
 	 	with	 	men	 	Mira-but-quotative-reflexive	 	do not be involved
 	 	"Don't be involved with the men of Mira."
47.2 Separation of Preverb and Verb
Under certain conditions, the preverb may be separated from the verb it modifies. In the following sentence, for example, the verb is parā pāi- 'hand over', but the preverb is separated from the verb by a negative particle:

 	 	kuwat-war-an	 	parā ŪL pesti
 	 	why-quotative-him	 	over-not-you give
 	 	"Why didn't you hand him over?"
The preverbs parā and āppa, to which enclitcs have been attached are separated from the verb by negative indefinites in the following sentence with the compound verbs parā nāi-, meaning 'add' here, and āppiya pēssiya- 'leave off, neglect':

 	 	parā-ma-ssan natta kuitki nāi
 	 	forth-but-locatival-nothing turns
 	 	āppa-ya-kan natta kuitki pessiyazzi
 	 	back-but-locatival-nothing-throws
 	 	"He does not add anything, nor does he leave off anything."
The multiple functions of these words as adverbs, postpositions, and preverbs can be a source of ambiguity. A native speaker of Hittite presumably had intuitions about which elements in a sentence belonged together, just as a speaker of English can sense that 'in' belongs with 'turned' in the sentence "She turned in her homework," but 'in' belongs with 'the driveway' in "She turned the car in the driveway." A modern reader of Hittite, however, has to rely upon clues from syntax and meaning to distinguish the function of these words. When the function word appears directly before the verb, it is likely to be a preverb. When the function word appears after a noun or pronoun in the accusative, genitive, dative-locative, ablative, instrumental, or allative, it is possibly to be interpreted as a postposition. Negatives, indefinites, and the adverbs namma 'moreover', imma 'indeed', kissan 'thus', and apenissan 'just so' may intervene between a preverb and its verb. Finally, a combination of function word plus verb that has a meaning clearly distinct from the meaning of the verb and difficult to reconstruct from the literal meaning of its parts is most likely a verb with preverb, for example, pēran weriya-, 'be involved with', which is composed of pēran 'before' and weriya- 'call (out)'.

48 Sentence Particles
Perhaps the only thing that is entirely clear about the sentence particles -kan, -ssan, -asta, (or -sta), -apa (or -pa), and -an is that they occur at the end of the sentence-initial enclitic chain. These particles, or some of them, have been variously described as indicating local relations between the verb and other elements in the sentence, as indicating locatival or other case functions, as modifiers of the verb that work in conjunction with preverbs, as remnants of pronouns used to establish relations between clauses, or as connective particles used to connect sentences or clauses. Much of the research done on the particles, however, suffers from problems resulting from lack of evidence or doubtful methodology. The particle -an is very rare. It is found only in the earliest texts, and it seems to have dropped out of use quite early. The fate of -apa (-pa), which is also rare and archaic, was similar, though related particles are found in the other Anatolian languages. The particle -asta (-sta) is also found in early texts and in copies of early texts but was lost from the living language by the Empire period. By contrast, -ssan (also -san) is fairly well attested in texts from most periods except the very latest, and -kan (sometimes spelled -kkan), which is rare in Old Hittite, increases dramatically in frequency in later texts.

48.1 Examples of asta
The rarity of -an and -apa means that little can be said with certainty about the functions of these paricles. It has been claimed that -asta (-sta) has an affinity for the ablative case, or for meanings associated with it and indeed, a sense of separation is found in sentences such as the following:

 	 	GIŠTUKULHI.A-us-sus-sta	 	ZAG.LU.ZA	 	dāhhun
 	 	weapons-their-locatival	 	shoulders	 	I took
 	 	"I took their weapons from their shoulder(s)."
The particle is found in a sentence with a noun in the ablative and with the compound verb katta pāi- 'go down' in the following:

 	 	mān-asta	 	GUD.MAH-a	 	KÁ.GAL-az	 	katta	 	paizzi
 	 	when-locatival	 	bull	 	gate (abl.)	 	down	 	goes
 	 	"When the bull goes down through the gate..."
Similarly, -asta is used with kattanda paī- 'go down into', though not with a noun in the ablative in, for example:

 	 	n-asta	 	DIM-nas	 	tān	 	annas-sis	 	kattanda pait
 	 	and-locatival	 	of the Stormgod	 	for a second time	 	mother-his	 	downward went
 	 	"For the second time, the mother of the Stormgod went downward."
However, katta pāi- is found without -asta in, the following sentence from a copy of a fairly early text:

 	 	nu	 	nekuz mēhūni	 	hūdāk	 	katta paitten
 	 	and	 	at night-time	 	immediately	 	down go
 	 	"At night time, go down immediately!"
The compound kattanda pāi- is found without a particle in, for example:

 	 	n-e	 	namma	 	hattesnas	 	kattanda nūmān pānzi
 	 	and-they	 	moreover	 	to holes	 	down negative they go
 	 	"And they do not want to go back down into (their) holes again."
The postposition katta 'down', modifying a noun with the ablative occurs with pai- and with the particle -kan rather than -asta in the following sentence from a fairly early text:

 	 	n-at-kan	 	katta	 	IŠTU KÁ.GAL-az	 	URUDāuniya	 	pānzi
 	 	and-they-locatival	 	down	 	from the gate (abl.)	 	city of Dauniya	 	they go
 	 	"And they go down from the Dauniya gate."
48.2 Examples of -ssan
The uses and meaning of the particle -ssan are somewhat clearer. It may have an affinity with the dative, locative, and allative, and may add the idea of superposition ("over, upon, on"), proximity, or accompaniment. It does occur often with a dative-locative and/or with the preverb and adverb sēr 'over, upon', for example:

 	 	serr-a-ssan	 	harnamma	 	BAPPIR	 	IŠTU	 	KAŠ	 	harnan	 	lahuwai
 	 	over-and-over	 	yeast	 	BAPPIR	 	with	 	beer	 	fermented	 	he pours
 	 	n-at	 	anda immiyanzi	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	and-them	 	into mixes	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"He pours over them (herbs) yeast (and) BAPPIR fermented with the beer, and he mixes them together."
Similarly, s:er and -ssan occur with huwāī- in the following sentence about vegetation growing over the sleeping god Telepenus:

 	 	sēr-s-a-ses-san	 	halenzu	 	huwaīs
 	 	over-but-him-over	 	halenzu-plant	 	ran
 	 	"But over him the halenzu-plant grew."
It is possible that the sense 'over' is conveyed by sēr rather than -ssan, but the particle may also be used without sēr but with a dative-locative or allative. In many of these instances, -ssan may indicate a goal:

 	 	nu-mu-ssan	 	zigg-a	 	KARAŠ-pat	 	hūdāk	 	arnut
 	 	and-to me	 	you-and	 	troops-those same	 	immediately	 	bring
 	 	"And you, bring those same troops to me immediately!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	LUGAL-us-san	 	DU-as	 	NA4huwasiya	 	anda paizzi
 	 	king-over-to	 	of the Stormgod	 	stele	 	into goes
 	 	"The king enters (the enclosure) to the stele of the Stormgod."
The particle may also strengthen or add the idea of a goal. In the first sentence, -ssan accompanies the adverb apiya 'there'; in the second sentence, however, it may be that -ssan alone imparts the idea of location:

 	 	nu-ssan	 	apiya	 	iyaddumat
 	 	and-locatival	 	there	 	go (pl.)
 	 	"Go there!"
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	n-as	 	KUR	 	URUHattusi	 	ŪL	 	hūisuwezzi	 	aki-pat-ssan
 	 	and-he	 	land	 	Hattusas	 	not	 	lives	 	he dies-instead-locatival
 	 	"He will not go on living in Hattusas; instead, he will die there."
48.3 The Particle -kan
The function of -kan is much harder to describe because it is so rare in early texts, in which its original, limited, meaning may have been preserved, and it is so common in later texts, where it has clearly replaced other particles.

49 Enclitic Conjunctions
The Hitite conjunctions -a 'but', -ma 'but, moreover', and -a, -ya 'and' are enclitic. That is, they have no independent accent but instead instead attach to a preceding independently accented word. Each of the enclitic conjunctions precedes all other enclitic particles and pronouns in the enclitic string.

49.1 Adversative -a-
The conjunction -a- 'but' is found mainly in early texts, and, although it is found in these texts beside the enclitic conjunction -ma, which is similar in meaning, -ma gradually spread at the expense of -a-, until -a- was eliminated. After vowels or idiograms it is spelled -ya, and after consonants it is spelled -a. Generally, it is attached to the initial word in its clause. Enclitic -a- may be used to conjoin two clauses, for example:

 	 	takkuw-as	 	attas-sas-a	 	É-ri	 	aki

 	 	DTelepenus-a	 	arha iyannis
 	 	Telepenus-but	 	away ran
 	 	"But Telepenus ran away."
49.2 -ma-
The enclitic particle -ma is very common. Its basic function is to indicate a correlation between adjacent clauses or between words or phrases within clauses. Often, it has an adversative sense and may be translated 'but'. However, its more general use is to mark that two or more items or actions belong together. It can be used to join clauses. In the following the adversative sense is fairly clear.

 	 	ammuk-ma-az	 	ŠÀ-az	 	lahlahhiman	 	ŪL	 	tarhmi
 	 	I-but-reflexive	 	from heart	 	worry	 	not	 	overcome
 	 	"But I cannot overcome the worry from (my) heart."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	natta-ma	 	taranzi	 	nu	 	natta	 	paimi
 	 	if	 	not-but	 	they say	 	then	 	not	 	I go
 	 	"But if they don't say, I will not go."
In correlating sentences with negatives, the sense may be 'nor':

 	 	DUMU.LÚ.ULÙ.LU	 	ŪL	 	innara	 	uwanun
 	 	mortal-man	 	not	 	by force	 	I come
 	 	ŪL-ma	 	sullani	 	uwanun	 	 
 	 	not-but	 	for quarrel	 	I come	 	 
 	 	"I, mortal man, have not come on my own account, nor have I come for strife."
In other contexts, though -ma may be translated as 'but' or 'and', the sense is neither clearly adversative nor conjunctive; instead, the particle serves to mark that action continues. In this sense, -ma may be used to mark the beginning of a turning point in a narrative or it may be used in a sentence that begins a paragraph that changes topics in an extended text.

 	 	mahhan-ma	 	hameshanza	 	kisat	 	man	 	 
 	 	when-but	 	spring	 	became	 	irrealis	 	 
 	 	INA	 	KUR	 	URUAzzi	 	taninumanzi	 	pāun
 	 	into	 	country	 	of Azzi	 	to restore order	 	I went
 	 	"But as soon as it became spring, I would have gone into the land of Azzi to restore order."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	tuk-ma	 	DUTUŠI	 	kuit	 	KUR-TAM	 	ADDIN
 	 	to you-but	 	my majesty	 	which	 	land	 	I have given
 	 	nu-za	 	apāt	 	KUR-TAM	 	pahsi	 	 
 	 	and-reflexive	 	that	 	land	 	protect	 	 
 	 	"But protect the land which I, My Majesty, have given to you."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	pēdi-ssi-ma	 	ZÀ.HA.LI-an	 	anenun
 	 	in place-its-and	 	cress	 	I sowed
 	 	"And on its site I sowed cress."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	ANA	 	MUhha-LÚ-ma	 	LÚTE4MU	 	wiyanun
 	 	to	 	Uhhazitti-moreover	 	messenger	 	I sent
 	 	"Moreover, to Uhhaziti I sent a messenger."
The conjunction -ma may also mark the correlation, or equivalence, of words within adjacent clauses that are parallel or otherwise closely related. In the following sentence from the "Telpenus Myth," -ma marks the parallel between the ewe's treatment of her lamb and the cow's treatment of her calf. If the sentence were translated into English, a semicolon might be an appropriate way of indicating the relationship between the clauses:

 	 	UDU-us-za	 	SILA4-ZU	 	mimmas
 	 	ewe-reflexive	 	lamb-her	 	rejected
 	 	GU4-ma	 	AMAR-ŠU	 	mimmas
 	 	cow-and	 	calf-her	 	rejected
 	 	"The ewe rejected her lamb; the cow rejected her calf."
Similarly, in the following from a ritual text, -ma marks the contrast between the appearance of the hawthorn bush in the spring, when it is in flower, and in the fall. This passage shows the overlap in function between contrastive -a and -ma, since in first clause contains -a, while the second contains -ma:

 	 	hameshi-ya-z	 	BABBARTIM	 	wassasi
 	 	in spring-but-reflexive	 	white	 	you wear
 	 	BURU14-ma-z	 	isharwanda	 	wassasi
 	 	at harvest time-but-reflexive	 	red	 	you wear
In negative constructions, -ma can mean 'nor' or 'neither ... nor':

 	 	ŪL	 	iyat	 	kuitki	 	ŪL-ma	 	wastas	 	kuitki
 	 	not	 	did	 	anything	 	not-but	 	sinned	 	any
 	 	ŪL-ma-kan	 	dās	 	kuedanikki	 	kuitki	 	 	 	 
 	 	not-but-locatival	 	took	 	from anyone	 	anything	 	 	 	 
 	 	"He neither did anything, nor committed any sin, nor took anything from anyone."
49.3 Conjunctive -a-, -ya- 'and'
The correlative enclitic conjunction -a 'and' resembles -a 'but', and, indeed, it took scholars a number of years after Hittite was deciphered to distinguish the two. Like the particle -a 'but', it normally written -ya after vowels and often, though not always written as -ya after Sumerograms and Akkadograms. Unlike -a 'but', however, the conjunction -a 'and' causes gemination, or doubling, of a consonant that it follows. Also, unlike -a 'but', -a 'and' is not confined to early texts:

 	 	GUD-ya-wa-mu	 	kuin	 	tet	 	nu-war-an-mu	 	uppi
 	 	ox-and-quotative-me	 	that	 	you said	 	and-quotative-it-me	 	send
 	 	"And the ox that you promised me, send it to me."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	apedani-ya	 	uddani	 	wasduli	 	harteni
 	 	for this-and	 	for matter	 	in sin	 	you hold
 	 	"...and for this matter you hold (us) in sin."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	memiyann-a-ssi	 	lē	 	mematti
 	 	word-and-to her	 	not	 	you speak
 	 	"And you should not speak a word to her."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	lalesmess-a	 	ŪL	 	siyānza
 	 	the invoice-and	 	not	 	sealed
 	 	"And the invoice was not sealed."
The conjunction -a 'and' is often used to join nouns within a clause. Generally, the enclitic is attached to the second noun, but it may occasionally be attached to the first, as in the last phrase.

 	 	n-at-kan	 	DINGIRMEŠ-as	 	antuhsass-a	 	āssu
 	 	and-it-locatival	 	to gods	 	men-and	 	dear
 	 	"It is dear to gods and men."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	nepis	 	tēkan-a	 	harsi
 	 	heaven	 	earth-and	 	you hold
 	 	"You hold heaven and earth."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	takku	 	attass-a	 	annas	 	mimmai
 	 	if	 	father-and	 	mother	 	refuse
 	 	"If the father and mother refuse (to make compensation to their daughter's jilted fiance)..."
The following sentence, from an Old Hittite historical text, has both -a 'but' and -a 'and':

 	 	GI^SBANHI.A-a-ssan	 	kuyēs	 	huettiyanta
 	 	bows-but-locatival	 	who	 	drawn
 	 	GIŠKAK.Ú.TAG.GAHI.A-ya	 	harkanzi	 	 
 	 	bows arrows-and	 	they hold	 	 
 	 	"But those who hold drawn bows and arrows..."
49.4 The Akkadogram Ù
In some instances the Akkadogram Ù 'and' is employed as a conjunction. It is not known how it was read in Hittite.

 	 	kī	 	NA4pēru	 	māhhan	 	uktūri	 	 
 	 	this	 	boulder	 	just as	 	eternal	 	 
 	 	BĒLU	 	Ù	 	DAM-ŠU	 	DUMUMEŠ-ŠU	 	QĀTAMMA
 	 	lord	 	and	 	wife-his	 	children-his	 	likewise
 	 	uktūres	 	asantu	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	eternal	 	let them be	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"Just as this boulder is eternal, let the lord (i.e. the king), his wife, and his children be eternal."
49.5 Omitted Conjunctions
Finally, clauses or phrases within a sentence may be closely connected but not conjoined with an overt conjunction:

 	 	ītten	 	azzikatten	 	akkuskatten
 	 	go	 	keep eating	 	keep drinking
 	 	"Go, keep eating (and) drinking! (i.e., 'remain alive')"
50 The Modal Particle man
Hittite, unlike Greek and Latin, had neither a subjunctive nor an optative. Instead, sentences that denote unreal, or contrary to fact conditions, potential conditions, or wishes, were signaled with the irrealis particle man. Normally, the particle is spelled ma-an as distinct from the conjunction mān (spelled ma-a-an), but examples of the particle spelled ma-a-an are sometimes found. The reasons behind this variation in spelling are not entirely clear.

50.1 Use in contrary-to-fact clauses
The particle man, sometimes called the "irrealis particle" is used with verbs in the past tense to indicate contrary to fact conditions, actions that the subject would or might have taken that were prevented or that simply did not occur for some reason.

For example, in the following sentence from the "Annals of Mursilis," the reason Mursilis does not go on a military campaign into Azzi is that the people of Azzi hear that he is coming and capitulate in advance of his expedition:

 	 	mahhan-ma	 	hameshanza	 	kisat	 	man	 	INA	 	KUR	 	URUAzzi
 	 	when-but	 	spring	 	became	 	irrealis	 	into	 	country	 	of Azzi
 	 	taninumanzi	 	pāun	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	to restore order	 	I went	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	"But as soon as it became spring, I would have gone into the land of Azzi to restore order."
In this sentence from the "Proclamation of Telepenus," Telepenus claims that his brother-in-law would have killed him and his wife had not the brother-in-law's intentions become known:

 	 	mān-us-kan	 	MHuzziyas	 	kuenta	 	nu	 	uttar	 	isduwāti
 	 	irrealis-them-locatival	 	Huzziyas	 	killed	 	but	 	plan	 	became known
 	 	"Huzziyas would have killed them, but the plan became known."
In this sentence from Mursili's "Annals" the contrary to fact clause with man begins the sentence. The expression "the year had become short" means that winter, the season during which Hittite kings did not campaign, was closing in:

 	 	man	 	INA	 	URUHayasa	 	pāun-pat
 	 	irrealis	 	into	 	Hayasa	 	I went-also
 	 	nu-za	 	MU.KAM-za	 	ser tēpauēssanza	 	 
 	 	and-reflexive	 	year	 	had become short	 	 
 	 	"I would also have gone to Hayasa (to attack it), but the year had become short."
The particle can be present in both the conditional clause and in the result clause:

 	 	man	 	tiyat	 	man-as-kan	 	suhhaz	 	katta	 	maustat
 	 	irrealis	 	stepped	 	irrealis-she-locatival	 	from roof	 	down	 	fell
 	 	"Had she (the goddess, Hebat) taken a step, she would have fallen down from the roof."
50.2 Use With the Present-Future
Sentences with man and verbs in the present-future and nominal sentences with man express possible actions. This sentence from the "Deeds of Suppiluliuma" begins with a clause with the conjuction mān 'if', and suggests a possible outcome if the conditions expressed in the if-clause are fulfilled:

 	 	mān-wa-mu	 	1-an	 	DUMU-KA	 	paisti
 	 	if-quotative-to me	 	one	 	son-your	 	you give
 	 	man-war-as-mu	 	LÚMUTIYA	 	kisari	 	 
 	 	irrealis-quotative-he-to me	 	husband	 	become	 	 
 	 	"If you give me one (of) your son(s), he could become my husband."
50.3 Use in Wishes
Man may also be used to express a wish of a speaker or of the subject of a sentence:

 	 	asi-man-wa	 	URU-as	 	ammel	 	kisari
 	 	that-irrealis-quotative	 	city	 	mine	 	becomes
 	 	"I wish that city were mine."
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	man-wa	 	MDUTUŠI	 	TI-eszi
 	 	irrealis-quotative	 	his majesty	 	lives
 	 	"I hope his majesty lives."
