Old Iranian 

Scott L. Harvey and Jonathan Slocum

The term 'Old Iranian' is the designation for the sub-group of Indo-European languages which, between approximately 1350 and 350 B.C., spread across the Iranian plateau, an area bounded in the north by present-day Turkmenistan, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus Mountains, in the East by the Indus River, in the south by the Persian Gulf, and in the west by Mesopotamia. Of these languages, Old and Young(er) Avestan and Old Persian are textually preserved. Median, Parthian, (Old) Sogdian, Carduchi, and Scythian are also known from their mention in Greek and Hellenistic sources, but are recorded only sporadically as glosses, toponyms, and lexical borrowings by speakers of the better-attested languages.

Indo-Iranian Origins
Too little historical or archaeological evidence is available to reconstruct definitively the earliest emergence of Iranian-speaking communities. There are, however, striking linguistic and ideological similarities between the extant texts of Old Iranian and those preserved in the closely related dialects of Old Indo-Aryan recorded in the regions to the east and west of the Iranian plateau. These include the Vedic liturgical texts of the Punjab region on the one hand, and a few words and passages from the legal and diplomatic documents of southeastern Anatolia's Mitanni kingdom, ruled by an Indo-Aryan minority, on the other. These Indo-Aryan and Iranian dialects have been collectively termed Indo-Iranian. A rough chronology can be established for the members of each dialect family by analyzing their linguistic evolution.

At some time between 2500 and 2000 B.C., a group or groups of nomadic Indo-European speaking peoples of Southeastern Russia and Central Asia migrated to the regions just north of the Iranian plateau. As they settled the region, the proto-language of Indo-Iranian gradually divided into Indo-Aryan and Iranian. By ca. 1500 B.C., various tribes from the Indo-Aryan group began to penetrate the Indian subcontinent; a small number also headed west. Though these developments do not shed any direct light on the emergence of the Iranian dialects, the historical information that they provide may at least be used to establish an initial chronological boundary.

The Indic group left behind a body of texts that contain the most complete picture of Indo-Iranian mythology and religion available. In the late 19th century, the great German philologist Max Müller gave a date to these texts by starting with the much later Indian Buddhist sutra literature and working his way back in time. Since these sutras contained the names of Indian and Hellenistic kings that are also mentioned in Greek works datable to ca. 200 B.C., Müller concluded that the two sets of texts were contemporary. Then, positing 200 years as a reasonable time for the development of each of several previous bodies of religious texts, he moved backwards from the sutras through each genre to arrive at a date of ca. 1400 B.C. for the earliest Indian literature, the Vedas. This date agrees with that of a treaty between the Indo-Aryan-ruled Mitanni of Anatolia and the Hittites, their neighbors to the west, ca. 1380 B.C. Though no similar record exists regarding the Iranians, it is reasonable to assume that whatever motivations the Indo-Aryans had for migrating into their future homelands at this time also led the Iranian groups to move into the Iranian plateau during the same period.

Indo-Iranian Religion
The Indo-Iranian religion, as it is preserved in the Indian Rigveda and its ancillary literature, consisted of plant and animal sacrifice conceived as a system of hospitable exchange between a pantheon of gods, or devas, and communities of human beings. Through priestly intermediaries, a human sacrificer invited to a sacrificial feast those gods whose favor he sought, offering into the fire gifts of meat, dairy products, and the invigorating beverage called soma to enhance the gods' power and strength. According to the system of reciprocal exchange inherited from the Indo-European tradition, this obliged the gods to act in turn on the sacrificer's behalf by assuring him continual acquisition of cattle, sustained good health, frequent military victory, and male progeny. As far as can be gleaned from existing literature, a similar ideology lay at the foundation of early Iranian ritual practice as well.

Avestan: Dialects and Dates
The term Avesta -- from the Pahlavi, or Middle Persian, avestak -- is used to denote the sacred literature of the early Iranian people, which preserves the earliest collections of an Iranian language. Though its meaning is uncertain, it is likely that the term refers to either the collected texts themselves or to the sacred knowledge contained in them. The language is preserved in two dialect forms denoted as 'Old' and 'Young(er)' Avestan. It is likely, however, that there is an overlap in time between the latest Old Avestan and the earliest Young Avestan since they share certain features. It may then be assumed that the two dialects were spoken in distinct regions by independent tribes or clans.

Each of the dialects is preserved in the Yasna, or 'sacrificial liturgy' in seventy-two chapters, of the Zoroastrian religion. The core of this collection, Chapters 28-53, contains the Gathas, or songs, of Zarathustra, poet-priest of the clan Spitama, and the Yasna Haptanhaiti, or the 'Sacrifice of the Seven Chapters', which together preserve the only Old Avestan literature extant. The Gathas are subdivided into five groups -- chapters 28-34, 43-46, 47-50, 51, and 53. The Haptanhaiti are inserted between the first and second of these collections as chapters 35-42; written in prose, these include prayers and praise to the various divine beings. Their language is still fairly archaic. The remaining Yasna chapters consist primarily of praise and offerings of thanksgiving written in the younger language in both poetry and prose. Young Avestan is also found in the prayer book called Khorda Avesta, the liturgical extensions collected as Visperad, the mythical literature and ethical code known as Venidad, and various fragments.

Since none of these texts make reference to anything historically verifiable, they cannot be dated precisely. The Old Avestan of the Gathas, however, is both linguistically and stylistically similar enough to the middle chronological layers of the Indian Vedas to be dated to the same period of time -- i.e., ca. 1250 - 1000 BC. The Haptanhaiti may be as much as a century or two younger. Because Young Avestan shows significant developments away from the older language, it may be dated between the 10th and 6th centuries B.C., though texts composed toward the end of this period contain enough grammatical errors to prove that the language was no longer fully understood by that time.

Zarathustra
As the author of the Gathas, the poet-priest Zarathustra is commonly credited as inaugurating the radical innovation that sets Iranian religion -- called Zoroastrianism in the West, after the Greek version of the poet's name -- apart from the remainder of Indo-Iranian tradition. Such degree of originality, however, is not assured. Though the later Zoroastrian tradition recognizes Zarathustra as its founder, the religion's origin is so obscure and its development so long that it is possible that others preceded him but were forgotten because the institutional structure necessary to preserve their work was insufficient at such an early date, or because Zarathustra's poetic or theological genius eclipsed all who came before, or both, or because of some other accident of history. Moreover, the nature of the innovation ascribed may not be quite as radical as is generally believed since Zarathustra can only be seen to stand the Indo-Iranian tradition on its head -- as is typically assumed -- from the point of view of the more voluminous Vedic liturgy. But sheer bulk proves nothing, and continued study of the available data may yet render very different results.

In the Rigveda's most linguistically archaic layers, an epithet -- asura -- was attributed to several of the more important gods of the ritual pantheon. Though the term's precise meaning remains uncertain in these earliest passages, it is clearly honorific in usage. Yet even here a struggle between this special group of gods and the others can be detected; by the beginning of the middle compositional period -- still early in terms of both linguistic and ideological development -- the term asura had been stripped of its elevated meaning. The Indian kavis, or poet-priests, had begun to apply the term, not to the most honored of their gods, but exclusively to the losers in the ensuing battle of divinities. The devas, pure and simple, became the victors, the ones worthy of worship, while the asuras were demonized as a new class, the honorific sense of the word lost in the dust-bin of a mythology irrevocably changed.

Yet Zarathustra sang of a quite similar cosmic struggle, in which the asuras -- or rather the ahuras, as they were known to him -- appear to have retained their elevated status among other gods, who were otherwise like them. Taken in conjunction with the similar usage in the earliest Rigveda, this suggests the Indo-Iranian antiquity of the term's honorific meaning; the innovation in the ontology of gods seems then to have been an Indian rather than an Iranian one. What was new in the Iranian tradition, where it differed from the conservative elements of the Indian belief, was the elevated degree of demarcation between those gods who were 'ahuric' and those who were not and were therefore demoted to a sort of demonic status. If the Rigveda is any indication, Indo-Iranian cosmology never developed the sophisticated, systematic duality that divided the Iranian cosmos, from heaven to earth through and through, in half. Zarathustra's contribution, then, was not a wholly new world view but one carried to its logical conclusion, in which one member of a group of ahuras -- Ahura Mazda, the 'Wise Lord' -- was honored above the others of his group, who were then personified as aspects of the Wise One's personality or manifestation in the world.

To complete the picture, Ahura Mazda was given an opponent, the (non-ahuric) daeva Angra Mainyu, the 'Evil Spirit'. These two were conceived to be in eternal conflict, bringing respectively either good or evil, asha (Truth/Order) or druj (deception), to both the divine and human realms. In fact, it is the inability to distinguish between these moral and ontological dualities that distinguishes, according to Zarathustra, ahuric beings and their human followers from daevas and theirs. Only through the power of Vohu Manah, 'Good Thinking', can order and righteousness prevail.

Later Developments
In the Haptanhaiti and, more extensively, the Young Avestan texts, Ahura Mazda was thought to be aided by six moral qualities emanating from himself and personified as amesha spentas, 'Beneficent Immortals'. Zarathustra simply called these ahuras; it is interesting to note that, though in all lists the amesha spentas are six in number, the texts claim that there are seven. Most likely, the seventh is Ahura Mazda himself, chief among the other ahuras who, in time, ceased to be known as such and became only amesha spentas.

The amesha spentas include the following. Vohu Manah, 'Good Thinking' or 'Good Mind', was already mentioned above. Asha Vahishta was the 'Highest Truth' in the world, the ideal underlying the order of things; Zarathustra constantly exhorted Asha's earthly followers, the Ashavan, or 'Possessors of the Truth', that they not be seduced or confused by the Dregvan, or 'Possessors of the Lie'. Xshatha Vairya personified Ahura Mazda's desired rule over the earth as a realm emancipated from Druj, a condition that Zarathustra hoped to bring about by persuading all people everywhere to follow his teaching. The spenta Armaiti was thought to be the earth's 'beneficent accord,' and had the earth entrusted to her care. Haurvatat and Ameretat embodied the 'prosperity' (or 'well-being') and 'immortality' that humanity sought. Finally, Shraosha represented proper 'obedience' to the other spentas, to Ahura Mazda's prophet Zarathustra, and to Ahura Mazda Himself.

Old Persian
Old Persian is known exclusively from inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings of Persia, found in southeastern Iran at the ancient capital Persepolis, at the ancient sites of Naqs-i-Rastam, Murghab, Susa, Hamadan, Behistan, and Elvend, and in Armenia and Western Egypt. These are primarily the inscriptions of Darius the Great and his successor Xerxes, who ruled from 521-486 and 486-465 B.C., respectively. They are inscribed in the scripts of various languages. Usually cuneiform but also Aramaic versions are found.

The inscriptions offer first-hand accounts, often propagandistic, of their authors' accomplishments in battle, which are usually ascribed to the will of Ahura Mazda. Thus, commands to obey the will of the king are accompanied by the insistence that doing so is also to obey the will of Ahura Mazda (since the latter placed the king on the throne). Xerxes' Daeva Inscription at Persepolis (cf. Lesson 10) also includes a record of the persistence of some older form of Indo-Iranian deva-worship, long since supplanted in the Acheaminid royal house by the advent and spread of the Zoroastrian reforms. Unfortunately, the nature and extent of these older practices are impossible to gauge.

Old Persian is not descended from Avestan, but rather evolved from a distinct dialect. No earlier sample of it is attested, but significant phonetic differences from Avestan and a much simplified case and verbal system suggest that Old Persian had a long history of development. Some of the changes can also be accounted for through the influence of neighboring languages (e.g., Assyrian, Babylonian, and the Iranian dialect Median) and languages of trade (e.g., Aramaic and Elamite).

Lesson 1: Old Avestan
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
The Gathas of Zarathustra are the earliest extant collection of an Old Iranian language. In form and stylistic technique, they are not unlike the larger collections of hymns preserved in the Indian Rigveda, since their author was a sacrificial priest reared in the same traditional methods of Indo-Iranian liturgical composition. Much of their grammar and vocabulary, however, is unique, and their strikingly different mythology gives a great deal more weight to theodicy and moral code than anything in any Indian work contemporary to the period. These differences often render comparison with the Indian texts well-nigh impossible; interpretation is often difficult, given the total absence of other contemporary works in Old Iranian dialects. Fortunately, Zarathustra's composition and ideology are rigorously unified and consistent and can at least be understood, albeit to a limited extent, within the framework of the hymns themselves.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Yasna 29, the Cow's Lament, is one of the most widely discussed Gathas in Zarathustra's opus. Nevertheless, it remains one of the most difficult to comprehend, since the hymn is unique among the Gathas for its dialogic form. Who is the cow? What is her purpose? Which other characters are speaking or described? Though the Rigveda preserves a number of hymns of this type, scholars have yet to determine their rules of composition with satisfactory precision. Thus, answers to these questions must be tentative at best. Yet as with Zarathustra's other compositions, the hymn shares themes and formulae with other Gathas and one can utilize these and the context of the hymn itself to formulate an interpretation.

The cow represents humanity at large, the Wise Lord's great flock of men. Her plight is their plight and the provider she seeks is the virtuous man who can lead them to prosperity. Zarathustra opens the hymn with the cow plaintively asking her Fashioner why He created for her such a sorrowful existence and imploring him to wrest her from its estate. In verse two, the Fashioner asks Truth to respond to the cow. Verse three is not easily attributed, though one may presume it is Truth's reply. Zarathustra makes the verse serve double duty, both as a warning against questioning the intentions of the gods and implying that Truth has sent him -- the poet -- as the 'savior' who is sought by the cow: "he to whom I shall go ... will be the strongest of beings." This introduces a major theme of the hymn. Verses four and five then read as the first direct address to Ahura Mazda, his Wise Lord. The remaining verses will be covered in Lesson 2.

Translation
1	 	The cow's soul lamented to you, [the gods]: "For whom did you create me?
 	 	      Who fashioned me?
 	 	Cruelty, oppression, bloodlust, rage, and violence have fettered me,
 	 	[And] there is no herdsman for me other than you.
 	 	      Therefore, you must all show me [the way to] good pastures."
 	 	 
2	 	Then the cow's Fashioner asked Truth: "What [was] your allotment for the cow
 	 	when, ruling [the earth], you all gave her cow-tending nourishment
 	 	      together with pasturage?
 	 	Whom do all of you desire as the Lord who would destroy the cruelty [wielded] by the
 	 	      Possessor of the Lie?"
 	 	 
3	 	[The one who is] not a slayer of the alliance with Truth
 	 	      [and is] free from hatred for the cow would reply to him:
 	 	"[One] is not to know of those [things] by which He drives the lowly to lofty [heights].
 	 	[But] he to whom I shall go, on account of [his] having sent out requests [for aid?],
 	 	      [will be] the strongest of beings.
 	 	 
4	 	[Zarathustra:] "The Wise One [is he] remembering best the pacts
 	 	      that, indeed, he has made with daevas and men sometime before [now]
 	 	And [those also] that he will make sometime later.
 	 	He is the discerning Lord; it will be for us just as he would wish."
 	 	 
5	 	[Zarathustra: And] so, then, do we two -- my soul and the fertile cow's --
 	 	      devote ourselves with zeal, with hands stretched out to the Lord,
 	 	So [that] we may dispose the Wise One to [answer our] inquiries.
 	 	Is there no prospect for the cattle-breeder living justly among the Possessors of the Lie?"
Grammar
1 The Alphabet
The earliest complete Avestan manuscripts date from the 13th to 14th centuries A.D. They are written in a script based on the Pahlavi, or Middle Persian alphabet, invented to record an earlier version of the texts during the Sassanid dynasty (ca. 224-640 A.D.). This earlier script had itself evolved from the Aramaic characters brought to the Iranian plateau several centuries earlier still. Like Aramaic, Avestan is read from right to left.

The alphabet is presented here in its English transliteration, organized by place and manner of articulation. The example of each character's approximate pronunciation is taken from American English unless otherwise noted.

In addition to the alphabet as described, the diphthongs /ay/ and /ao/ are written as contiguous letters:

 	 	aē	 	sight
 	 	ao	 	ouch
2 The Sound System
2.1 Phonology
The original pronunciation of both the old and the younger Avestan language is unknown. Existing texts reflect only the liturgical enunciation of the hymns at the time they were first written down, ca. 400 A.D. No more than a few fragments of these earliest recensions are extant; peculiar word breaks, meaningless repetitions of verbal prefixes, and metrical erosion show that the scribes had lost living contact with the language by this time. (Pliny and the Parsi tradition both refer to an older manuscript recorded under the Arsacids who ruled from ca. 250 B.C. to 226 A.D., but no physical evidence survives. Scholars who accept its existence believe that it had an even simpler and more ambiguous orthography than the Sassanid fragments.) The degree of phonemic change that occurred between the original composition and this fifth century recension, and between this recension and the extant manuscripts from ca. 1350 A.D., cannot be gauged. Nevertheless, the pronunciation of the existing script is more or less certain. Each letter represents one discrete phoneme and must, for the most part, be read individually. Exceptions are the vowel combinations comprising diphthongs and the sequence ng.

Vowels:	 	Front	 	 	 	Central	 	 	 	Back
High	 	i, ī	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	u, ū
Mid	 	 	 	o, ō	 	 	 	e, ē	 	 
Low	 	 	 	 	 	a, ā	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	ə, ə̄	 	 	 	 
Diphthongs:	 	å, aē, ao

 	 	Unvoiced	 	Unvoiced	 	Voiced	 	Voiced	 	 	 	Unvoiced	 	Voiced

Palatals:	 	c	 	 	 	j	 	 	 	ń	 	š, ṣ̌, š́	 	ž
Cerebrals:	 	ṯ	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Dentals:	 	t	 	θ	 	d	 	δ	 	n, (ṇ)	 	s	 	z
Labials:	 	p, f	 	 	 	b, B	 	 	 	m, m̨	 	 	 	 
Semivowels:	 	y, r, v
Aspirates:	 	h
2.2 Accentuation
Avestan orthography does not indicate accentuation, but scholars have traced four phonetic patterns that must be ascribed to stress. The change h > xÉ is seen to occur when the vowel following h is accented. Likewise, an r clustered with a following unvoiced velar, dental, or labial devoices when the vowel preceding that r is accented: rk > hrk, rt > , and rp > hrp. In both instances, ca 'and' when added to the word shifts the accent to the final syllable.

2.3 Length of Final Vowels
Word-final vowels are generally long in Old Avestan (OAv) and short in Younger Avestan (YAv). The examples in these lessons are in Old Avestan.

3 Noun Inflection
Avestan is highly inflected. This means that, unlike English whose syntax is primarily governed by word order and the use of prepositions, the functional relationships among the various words in a sentence are expressed by inflections, or endings, added to the stem, or base form, of a noun or adjective.

There are cases in Avestan. In addition to syntactic function, these also express number -- singular, dual, or plural. Each noun also has gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter.

The cases are as follows:

Case	 	Primary Function	 	English Translation
Nominative	 	Grammatical Subject	 	(subject)
Accusative	 	Direct Object	 	(object)
Instrumental	 	Object of Means	 	by, with
Dative	 	Indirect Object	 	to, for, for the sake of
Ablative	 	Object of Origin	 	from, out of, on account of
Genitive	 	Subject of Possession or Character	 	of
Locative	 	Object of Location	 	in, on, upon, over, under, at, etc.
Vocative	 	Object of Address	 	('you', or name of person being addressed)
Case names and other grammatical terms are often abbreviated in these lessons (e.g., 'sg.' for singular, 'du.' for dual).

The nominal inflections applied to nouns and adjectives are classified according to the final letter of the noun's stem. Each "stem type" takes its own set of inflections, for which paradigms will be given through the course of these lessons. For each paradigm, a single word will be used; where a case form is not attested for that word, but is found for other words of the same stem type, the 'reconstructed' form will be marked by an asterisk. Where no attestation of a case exists for any word of the stem type, the form will be labelled 'unattested'.

4 Verb Inflection
Verbal inflections are added to a stem whose form conveys the tense of a verb. These endings express person, number, mood, and voice.

There are three persons (first, second, and third), and three numbers (singular, dual, and plural).

'Mood' refers to the attitude of the speaker towards an action. The indicative mood conveys a merely descriptive sense and is translated with the simple verb. The imperative mood indicates a command. Avestan also includes two potential moods, a subjunctive and an optative; the former conveys a greater sense of probability than the latter. As in Sanskrit, the subjunctive is found much more frequently in the older language (Vedic, Old Avestan) than in the younger (Classical Sanskrit, Younger Avestan); its functions are gradually replaced, with respect to the degree of probability to be communicated, by the optative mood and the future tense.

'Voice' refers to the nature of the action with respect to the logical subject of a sentence. The active voice indicates direct action. The middle voice signals that a self-reflexive purpose or benefit to the subject motivates the action expressed. The passive is used when the agent of a sentence is not the grammatical subject; it is treated in Lesson 5.

The four tenses -- present, aorist, perfect, and future -- are classified by the formation of the stem, to which endings are added. The present system is divided into two types, thematic and athematic. The thematic classes are presented below; the athematic classes and the other tense systems will be treated in subsequent lessons.

4.1 The Present Tense
The present tense conveys action that occurs at the time of speaking. It may be translated with either a general sense, as in "Zarathustra spins a tale," or with a continuous sense, as in "Zarathustra is spinning a tale."

Stems of the present system that end with the theme-vowel -a- are called thematic. This -a- may be added directly to a verbal root in its stong or weak grade (cf. Section 8.2 on vowel gradation) as in the examples below, or it may be a part of the fuller suffixes -ya- or -aya-. To this stem, various endings are added.

Thematic Present Paradigms: bara- 'carry, bear'

2 sg.	 	barahi	 	unattested

3 pl.	 	barayən	 	*barayan̨ta
4.2 The Imperfect
The present system also includes the imperfect, a past tense; it is discussed in Lesson 5.

5 Word Order
The standard word order of an Avestan clause or sentence is generally Subject-Object-Verb, though the texts in these lessons are poetic in nature and tend to be freer in form. Two common exceptions to the "verb last" rule are when a verb is accompanied by an adverbial preposition, which may appear in the final position, and when a verb is embedded between an adjective and a noun. Adjectives generally precede the nouns they modify, though sometimes separated by other words.

As an example of the "verb last" rule, Yasna 29 opens with a clause ended by the verb gərəždā:

 	 	xšmaibyā	 	gə̄uš	 	urvā	 	gərəždā
 	 	To you	 	the cow's	 	soul	 	laments...
The first line of verse 5 demonstrates typical adjective-noun word order,

 	 	aṯ	 	vā	 	ustānāiš	 	ahvā	 	zastāiš	 	frīnəmnā	 	ahurāi-ā
 	 	And so	 	we two	 	with outstretched	 	dwell	 	(with) hands	 	devoting ourselves	 	to the Lord,
where ustānāiš 'outstretched' precedes the noun zastāiš 'hands' and the phrase ends in the adverb rather than the verb (or, as here, rather than the verbal adjective). The adjective and noun enclosing the clause's main verb ahvā 'we two dwell' is a form of discontinuous word order called 'enclosure'.

These rules are of great help to the translator or interpreter of an Avestan liturgical text. Nevertheless, ambiguity may occasionally occur. A line from Yasna 43.15, for example, may be rendered in two ways:

 	 	... vīspə̄ng angrə̄ng ašanō ādarə
 	 	... They call all the evil (ones) truthful.
 	 	... They call all the truthful (ones) evil.
Here, the accusative plural adjective vīspə̄ng 'all' precedes both of the accusative plural nouns angrə̄ng 'evil' and ašanō 'truthful', and may be taken with either one since the stylistic device of the 'enclosure' may or may not be employed. In such situations one must decide, based on context, which of the meanings best represents the author's intent.

An exception to the standard adjective-noun pattern became formulaic in the later language: ahura- mazdah-, literally 'Lord wise'. The phrase first appeared in the Gathas, but only with a caesura or another [enclosed] word in between, as in 51.15 or 51.5,

caesura:	 	garō dəmānē ahurō       mazdā jasaṯ ...
 	 	Ahura Mazda went into the house of song ...
 	 	 
enclosure:	 	ahurō xšaθrā mazdå...
 	 	Ahura Mazda, by (his) power...
The phrase grew increasingly frequent in the Yasna Haptanhaiti and, by the time of the younger language, would become the usual form, with or without caesura or enclosure.


Lesson 2: Old Avestan
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
In addition to the 'ahuric' beings that Zarathustra's poetry brings to light, several Gathas also mention Geush Tashan, the 'Creator of the Cow', and Geush Urvan, the 'Soul of the Cow'. Though the ontological status of these two is not clearly spelled out, they do seem to maintain at least a semi-divine status due to their central role in early Iranian social life. Like their Indian cousins, the Eastern Iranians of this period were pastoral nomads. Their economy depended on cattle and, from the earliest times, their sacrificial ritual incorporated this most precious commodity by offering it up to the gods. While Zarathustra seems to have proscribed this older practice, he continued to employ the symbols of the earlier age, even as he refashioned them in keeping with new themes.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Yasna 29 continues with Ahura Mazda's response to Zarathustra's invocation. He appears to ignore Zarathustra himself and address only the cow, whose inquiry began the hymn. Zarathustra, as poet, seems to be using this speech to begin a progression to his main point, i.e. that it is he who is the spokesman who can lead humanity to their god. In verse six, Ahura Mazda declares that there is no one righteous enough to play this role, but then asks, in seven, if this is really so. In verse eight, Good Mind personified determines it is not, for Zarathustra Spitama stands ready to sing the Truth, inspired by the sweetness of right thinking. Verses nine through eleven then show the cow's reluctance to accept Zarathustra, Zarathustra's willingness to accept the responsibility, and finally the cow's acceptance of Zarathustra as her ambassador to the gods and Mazda's ambassador to the world.

Translation
6	 	So the Wise Lord, the Knowing One, speaks the solemn words [inspired] by [his] insight:
 	 	"There is no lord found by even one [among us], nor a paragon in accordance with any Truth.
 	 	Alas, the Fashioner has fashioned you for the benefit of the cattle breeder and the herdsman.
 	 	 
7	 	"The Lord [who is] allied with Truth fashioned the magic formula
 	 	      for [procuring] butter and milk for the cow.1
 	 	This Wise (One) is beneficent towards the emaciated in accordance with the teaching.
 	 	Who is there for you who might set these [things] down for mortals by Good Mind?"
 	 	 
8	 	[Good Mind?: There is] this [one] found here for me who alone hears our [holy] teachings --
 	 	Zarathustra Spitama: he wishes to recite [praises] for us and for Truth, O Wise One,
 	 	If I shall give to him sweetness of voice."
 	 	 
9	 	And so the soul of the cow laments: "I who am to accept a powerless provider,
 	 	A weak man's voice which I wish [to be] strong --
 	 	When during my lifetime will he emerge, [the one] who lends to him a helping hand?"
 	 	 
10	 	[Zarathustra:] "O Lord, may you give strength to them2 through Truth,
 	 	And that power, [which comes] through Good Mind, by which one may receive
 	 	      comfort and peace.
 	 	For I myself, O Wise One, know You as the Primordial Provider of that."
 	 	 
11	 	[The Cow:] "Where are Truth, Good Mind, and [their] power? Know me,
 	 	      through the mortal one,3
 	 	You, O Wise One, in Your concern for the great offering.
 	 	Come down to us now, O Lord, on account of our gift for those like you."

7 Personal Pronouns
Pronominal forms abound in the Avestan language. The first and second person are unique, while the third person uses primarily the first of three third person pronominal stems. Both full and enclitic forms appear (on the use of clitics, cf. Section 15). The oblique cases of all personal pronouns form a suppletive system, i.e., they are based on a stem different than that of the nominative case.

7.1 First and Second Person Pronouns
The first and second person pronouns have no inherent gender, and no locative or vocative forms appear. Dual forms are rare. The azem- 'I' and tvə̄m- 'you' paradigms are given here, with enclitic forms in parentheses.

Singular:	 	First Person	 	Second Person
Nom.	 	azə̄m	 	tvə̄m, tūm4 (tū)
Acc.	 	(mā)	 	θąm (θvā)
Instr.	 	unattested	 	θvā4
Dat.	 	mabya, mabyah (mai)	 	tabya, tabyah (tai)
Abl.	 	mat	 	θat
Gen.	 	mana	 	tava (tai)
Plural:	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	vayam	 	yūžam

Abl.	 	ahmat	 	šmat, yušmat
Gen.	 	(nah)	 	(vah)
7.2 Third Person/Demonstrative Pronouns
The unique third person pronoun stems hi- and YAv. di- 'he, she, it' are found only as enclitic forms. The demonstrative pronoun ha- 'this', suppletive ta-, doubles as the standard third person pronoun 'he, she, it'.

Singular:	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine

8 Athematic Presents and Ablaut
As noted in Lesson 1, verbs of the present system are based on various stems; thematic stems were discussed there. Five classes of athematic stems are attested, with grades that depend upon ablaut.

8.1 Athematic Classes
The root class stems add an ending directly to the verbal root, e.g. ahmi 'I am', first person singular present indicative active of ah 'be'. The root may appear in its strong or weak grade, depending on the verb's ablaut pattern, on which see Section 8.2 below.

The reduplicating class forms its stem by adding a reduplicated syllable to the beginning of a verbal root. For roots beginning in a consonant, the reduplication usually consists of that consonant plus a, a̱, i, or u. But if the initial consonant is velar, it is reduplicated with a corresponding palatal (cf. Lesson 1, Section 2 for lists of velars and palatals). For example, jigərəz- > gərəz. Further, when an original Proto-Indo-Iranian (PII) stop or s has changed in the Avestan, as e.g. *p > f and *s > h, the PII stop and the s are preserved in the root but changed in the reduplication. Thus, hišay- > ši, šay-.

The na̱- class and nu- class add a form of -na̱-/-na- or -nau-/-nu- to the root, according to ablaut pattern. A third nasal category, the infix class, has -na- inside the root.

Athematic Present Paradigms: ah 'be' and mrū 'speak, say'

Indicative	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	ahmi	 	mruyai
2 sg.	 	ahi	 	*mrušai

Optative	 	 	 	 
2 sg.	 	hyə̄m	 	mruviša
3 sg.	 	hyāṯ	 	mruvītā
8.2 Vowel Gradation
The Avestan verbal system exhibits evidence of vowel gradation, or ablaut, which occurred earlier in Proto-Indo-European. The vowel in either the root or suffix of a verbal stem may change depending on whether or not that syllable was stressed. When the vowel was stressed, its grade is strong or full. This strong grade is formed by adding a short -a- to the vowel. For example, the third person singular middle imperative of mru is mraotū 'let him speak!', where u > o under the influence of added a. If the vowel was unstressed, the grade is weak and the vowel remains unchanged, as in the first person singular middle indicative mruyai 'I say', or it is reduced, as in the third person plural active frinənti 'they satisfy' from the stem frinā-. (Here, the final ā of the stem is reduced to ə before the ending is added.) Another example, from the nasal-infix class, may be even more clear: the third person singular active indicative vinasti 'he finds', from the root vid, vs. the third person singlar middle *vindatai 'they find.'

Verbs of the root class also fall into two sub-categories according to their ablaut pattern. Roots of this class having a static ablaut pattern always have the accent on the root, so the verb always appears with the root in the strong grade; roots having a changing, i.e., dynamic ablaut pattern appear in the strong grade in the singular indicative and injunctive active, in the active and middle subjunctive, and in the third person singular imperative active.

9 Causatives and Denominatives
A causative stem is formed by strengthening a root and adding the suffix -aya- to it. The endings of the present system are then added to complete the verb. As its name implies, the causative form changes a verb's meaning to convey the sense of causativity: e.g., vat, vatahi 'you understand' vs. vātayahi 'you cause to understand' = 'you explain'.

A denominative is a verbal stem formed by adding the suffix -ye- to a noun stem. Like the causative, it takes the endings of the present system: vāra- msc. 'rain' > vārayemi 'I rain down'.

10 Adverbs, Prepositions, and Preverbs
Avestan adverbs can be analyzed into two types: those that are clearly derivative from inflectional forms, and those that are not.

10.1 Derived Adverbial Forms
The derivation of adverbs from adjectives or other parts of speech was not systematic in Avestan. Some are frozen inflectional forms.

Adverbs based on a-stems, h-stems, and t-stems may be accusative; e.g., arəm 'correctly, properly', ākāh 'certainly' (?), and θaṯ 'then, again'.

Adverbs derived from a-stems and t-stems may be instrumental; e.g., tā 'thus, in this way, therefore' and yavatā 'insomuch as'.

Adverbs with ablative endings are based only on a-stems; e.g., asnāṯ 'nearby'.

There is one locative adverb, durai 'far', with the ablative durāṯ having similar meaning.

Derivative adverbs usually stand after the object of the verb that they modify; in a standard Subject-Object-Verb sentence, between the object and the main verb. This rule is not hard and fast, however.

10.2 Non-derivative Adverbs, including Prepositions and Preverbs
A number of adverbial forms do not appear to be derived from other parts of speech. These may be classed as to whether they function independently, or as prepositions and verbal prefixes.

Some examples of independent non-derivative adverbs include:

 	 	āviš visible, manifest
 	 	azdā certain
 	 	kū where
 	 	nū, nūrə̄m now
Some adverbs function as prepositions and verbal prefixes. The most common examples are as follows:

 	 	Preposition or Verbal Prefix	 	Verbal Prefix	 	Preposition
 	 	antar between	 	apa away	 	parā before
 	 	api toward	 	ni down	 	 
 	 	ava down	 	niš out	 	 
 	 	ā near, back	 	fra forth, toward	 	 
 	 	upa up to	 	vi apart	 	 
 	 	pati toward, against	 	ham together	 	 
 	 	pairi around	 	 	 	 
 	 	parā away	 	 	 	 
Non-derivative adverbs follow the word order of their derivative counterparts. Those functioning as prepositions and preverbs usually precede the word they modify. Preverbs may commonly be used as postpositions.

Footnotes

1	 	'Butter and milk' is a metaphor for 'strength and prosperity' often employed by Zarathustra.
2	 	Insler renders this 'to these mortals' and Humbach 'to those present,' suggesting a request on behalf of all men or just Zarathustra's audience, respectively. I leave the pronoun's reference open.
3	 	Zarathustra.
4	 	Young Avestan form.

Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
A stark contrast between good and evil forms the backbone of Zarathustra's teaching, permeating every aspect of existence, both human and divine. The continuous war between Ahuras and Daevas parallels the continuous war between the old religion and the new, the struggle between the followers of the Truth and the followers of the Lie, and every individual's personal dilemma in choosing 'good thoughts, words, and deeds' over bad. Victory turns most poignantly on the last: every right choice on the part of a single individual increases the quantity, strength, and power of good in the entire world; every wrong choice, the magnitude of bad.

Reading and Textual Analysis
Yasna 53, the 'Wedding Hymn', is relatively short but densely packed. It continues the thematic link already seen in Yasna 29 between fertility and prosperity on the one hand, and morality and faith on the other, by likening both the social and physical union of the earthly bride and groom to the 'mythic' union of Wisdom and Truth, an event that lays 'the firm foundation of Good Mind'.

Zarathustra opens the hymn by announcing the conditions that would prove it is his sacrificial practice -- and by extension his doctrine -- that should be taken as the model for all others. Perhaps, too, he is even subtly invoking Ahura Mazda to create these very conditions in exchange for the people's support: "If you make a good existence for me, your sacrificer and voice among men," Zarathustra seems to say, "and for those who follow me as well, many more will adopt the practice you have laid out for humankind." In verse two, the audience is formally introduced to the fathers of the bride and groom, Kavi Vishtaspa and Frahaostra, respectively. In verses three and four, Zarathustra then turns to the matter at hand -- the marriage of Vishtaspa's daughter to Frahaostra's son -- and enunciates the merits thus brought to the community.

Verse five seems to be more generally directed, addressing everyone who is married or soon to be married, or perhaps others who are getting married alongside Spitami and Frahaostra's son. In verse six, Zarathustra waxes didactic, explaining how marriage remains 'the firm foundation of Good Mind' only insomuch as the spousal pair remain faithful to each other and not give in to the superficial pleasures that immoral actions may bring. Prosperity that comes by means of Deceit, by means of the Lie, will ultimately, Zarathustra insists, bring only weakness and death, while in verse seven he promises that fidelity, moral purity, and quite persistent 'exertion' will bear fruit. He clearly puts the brunt of the ethical burden, however, on the wife, for it is only she, he says, whose sexual purity will keep 'the spirit of the Possessor of the Lie' at bay. If all these conditions are maintained, Zarathustra promises in verse eight, the wealth and vitality of the unfaithful will be redirected to Ahura Mazda's flock. The poet closes the hymn with further encouragement to choose right over deceit and a last invocation to Ahura Mazda.

Translation
1	 	The sacrifice of Zarathustra Spitama is feted as the best
 	 	If the Wise Lord would, in accordance with Truth,
 	 	      give [these] rewards to him throughout all [his] life:
 	 	A good existence for him and for those who determine and understand
 	 	The words and deeds of [his] good vision.
 	 	 
2	 	And so let Kavi Vishtaspa -- a Spitama, a son of Zarathustra
 	 	      -- and Frahaostra readily pursue,
 	 	With good thought, with words and deeds,
 	 	The succor of the Wise One, and paeans for His adulation,
 	 	And [also] the straight path of the gift whose inspiration
 	 	      the Lord gives out of [his] power to give.
 	 	 
3	 	And now, Pouruchista Spitami, descendent of Haecataspa,
 	 	Youngest of the daughters of Zarathustra,
 	 	Gives to all of you the alliance of Truth and Wisdom,
 	 	      the firm foundation of Good Mind.
 	 	Therefore, consult your inner strength and blessedly engage yourself
 	 	      with the most sacred [deeds] of Armaiti.
 	 	 
4	 	For on behalf of all of you, I shall eagerly wed to him [the woman]
 	 	      who tends to [her] father
 	 	[Her] husband, the herdsman [of his clan], and [his] family possessions.
 	 	Truthful to the truthful ones, Ahura Mazda gives [to her] the sun-like
 	 	      fruition of Good Mind, illuminating [her] thought
 	 	For the sake of good vision, throughout [her] entire life.
 	 	 
5	 	I pronounce to [you] young women being married,
 	 	      and [likewise] to you [men],
 	 	The commandments of one possessed of [good?] speech:
 	 	      Bear them in mind.
 	 	Through good vision, find for yourselves -- and for them, [your wives] --
 	 	      a life which [is] of Good Mind.
 	 	[And] through Truth, let each of you desire to win the other over.
 	 	For that would be fruitful for each one.
 	 	 
6	 	In this way these [things are] true, O men; in that way [they are true], O wives.
 	 	[There is an] adherent of deceit whom all of you see
 	 	     [clinging] to the prosperity [arising] out of deceit:
 	 	[But] I take away these defenses of [his] person. For Advocates of the Lie,
 	 	      sighing, poor nourishment results,
 	 	      [and a life of] 'easy breathing' is lost1
 	 	For Violators of Truth. [Allied] with them, you will destroy for yourselves
 	 	      the spiritual life.
 	 	 
7	 	And so, for all of you, [good] fruit will come from this ritual exchange
 	 	As long as the 'impeller,' full of zeal, [keeps] driving, down and deep,
 	 	At the base of [her] two thighs, from whence the spirit
 	 	      of the Possessor of the Lie has already disappeared.
 	 	Abandon this ritual exchange and your last word is 'woe'!
 	 	 
8	 	Let the wrong-doers be [made] impotent by these [things],
 	 	And, weakened, let them all cry out.
 	 	And by means of good rule among man-killing and
 	 	      man-defiling [Possessors of the Lie?]
 	 	Let one grant peace with them to the settled clans.
 	 	Let that greatest pain arise upon them, [that which comes]
 	 	      through the shackle of death. And let it be soon!
 	 	 
9	 	On account of those who choose badly,
 	 	      poison adheres to him, [the righteous man],
 	 	[As do] darkness and lack, those violators of Truth
 	 	      whose bodies are to be brought to an end.
 	 	Where is the truthful Lord who would rob them of life and liberty?
 	 	The power is yours, O Wise One, by which you would grant a better (life)
 	 	      to the poor man living rightly.
Grammar
11 an̨t-, man̨t-, and van̨t-stem Nouns
Nominal stems in an̨t form a simple adjective and the present participle active; man̨t and van̨t mark the possessive adjective. The inflections for the simple and possessive masculine adjectives are nearly the same, taking the weakened stem at in the oblique cases. Participles built on thematic verbal stems maintain the full nominal stem in most instances. Those built on athematic stems decline like other adjectives. Masculine and neuter oblique cases are identical. The feminine shows the same ablaut pattern, but adds ī to complete the stem and thus declines like long ī-stem nouns (cf. Section 6.2).

13 The Aorist Tense
As already noted in Section 4, a verb's tense is indicated by the formation of its stem. In addition to the present stems encountered there, Avestan also includes a category of aorist stems that, like those of the present system, are constructed in various ways. Seven forms of the aorist stem occur: root, reduplicated, thematic, and four forms of sigmatic. The root aorist adds its termination directly to the root. The reduplicated aorist adds the first vowel of its root, and any consonant immediately preceding that vowel, in front of the zero-grade of that root. E.g., vaoc- < vac, showing the reduplicated syllable va before the zero-grade uc-. Thematic aorists, like thematic presents, add the theme-vowel -a- to the root, which is usually in middle grade. Sigmatic aorists add -h/š-, -ha/sa-, -ih/iš-, or -hih/šiš-, with aspirate and sibilant variation according to environment.

The basic structure of an aorist verb is: augment + stem + termination, with the short vowel a- filling the space of the augment. In practice, however, the augment is rare, and is seen only in the indicative mood. This has led to a further distinction between the aorist 'injunctive', which exhibits no augment, and the aorist 'indicative', which has the full formation. Both have indicative sense, but there is a distinction between them. The aorist indicative denotes a definitely past sense, as in the form anąsaṯ in verse 7 of the passage above:

 	 	... yaθrā mainyuš drəgvatō anąsaṯ parā
 	 	... [the place] where the spirit of the Deceitful One disappeared.
Here, the Deceitful One's disappearing has transpired: the action is fully past. The injunctive, by contrast, more often denotes a more general sense with respect to time -- i.e., something that is just always generally so, as in verse 6:

 	 	... nąsaṯ xvathrə̄m / drəgvōdebyō
 	 	... [a life of] 'easy breathing' is lost / For Violators of Truth.
Here, given the previously established conditions, the loss of 'easy breathing' necessarily results and therefore the injunctive form is used. It is important to note, however, that though this distinction always holds for the aorist indicative, which only gives a fully past sense, Zarathustra used the injunctive in both ways. For this reason, the distinction has been analyzed in these lessons as one between the 'aorist indicative' and the 'augmented aorist indicative'. Accordingly, the 'aorist indicative' has been translated to convey either a general or a past tense, according to context, while the 'augmented aorist indicative' always indicates only past tense.

Since all aorist forms are similar, only the root aorist paradigm will be presented here.

14 The Present Participle
A participle is a verbal noun, a verb stem that takes a nominal ending. It functions syntactically as either an adjective to modify a noun, or as a substantive to replace it. Like verbs, participles display an active, middle, or passive voice and a past, present, or future tense.

An example of the present participle in English can be illustrated by the word 'running'. In each of the sentences, "The water is running" and "The running water is cold," the verb 'run' is an adjective describing 'water'. In Avestan, the word may also be used as the subject of the sentence to describe someone or something that is running, as in "The running (one) is passing by," but this is unusual in English. Keeping in mind that a participle is adjectival, however, the common slang "The big, the bad, and the ugly..." may illustrate the same principle. Though 'big', 'bad', and 'ugly' are not participles, they are adjectives standing in for the nouns they modify (e.g., 'The big men', 'the bad men', etc.), a usage that participles commonly have in Avestan.

The present active participle is formed by adding the ending -ant to a present verbal stem; the paradigm is given above in Section 12. As noted there, those constructed on thematic verbal stems have less ablaut in declension. The middle participle adds the ending -amna to the thematic stem, or -āna to the athematic. Both decline as short-a nouns in the masculine or neuter, and long-ā nouns in the feminine.

15 Conjunctions, Clitics, and a Note on Puns
15.1 Conjunctions, Particles, Interjections, and Clitics
Avestan uses many conjunctions and particles, and occassionally employs interjections. The most common conjunctions are ca 'and', uta 'and', ca ... ca 'both ... and', vā 'or', and tu 'but' (sometimes with emphatic sense). Like their Sanskrit conterparts, they are enclitic. Of the three, ca is the most variable in meaning: it can sometimes be translated as 'or', as 'but', or even as an emphatic particle.

Three types of particles -- negative, emphatic, and indefinite -- predominate. The negative particles are three: nōiṯ 'no, not', naēdā 'and not', and mā, a prohibitive particle employed with a verb in the imperative mood. The emphatic particles include bā, usually left untranslated, vai 'verily, indeed', and zi 'for, indeed'. The particles cit and cana added to an interrogative pronoun, and ciθit added to a preposition, produce an indefinite sense; e.g., kah 'who, what' beside kas-cit 'someone, any one' or pairī 'around, toward, away from' next to pairī-ciθit 'sometime/place before.'

Two interjections occur: avai and vayai. Their translations vary, depending on context.

15.2 Puns
The passage selected for this lesson includes an unusual syntactic construction. In verse 6, line 3, Zarathustra employs the verb nasaṯ as two words conveyed by one. The third person singular reduplicated aorist of ans and the third person singular root aorist of nas, both active, are both intended. The objects of the respective verbs flank their 'collapsed' appearance, dušxvarəθəm 'spoiled food' to be taken with ans 'result', and xva̱θrəm 'easy breathing' with nas 'be lost'.

 	 	drūjō āyəsə̄ hōiš piθā tanvō parā
 	 	vayū-beredubyō duš-xvarəthə̄m       nąsaṯ xvathrə̄m
 	 	For Advocates of the Lie, sighing, poor nourishment attains,
 	 	[and an existence of] 'breathing easy' is lost.
With the further alliteration and phonetic play between xvarəθəm and xva̱θrəm, the phrase is a prime illustration of Zarathustra's remarkable poetic skill and innovation.

Footnote

1	 	The play on the two verbs sharing one aoristic form našaṯ 'attain' and 'is lost' is unfortunately itself lost in its English rendition, but the reader should try to imagine the poetic elegance of the phrase.


Lesson 4: Old Avestan
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
Reading and Textual Analysis
This hymn, Yasna 30, provides an excellent statement of Zarathustra's dualism. While he maintained monotheism with Ahura Mazda as sole god, he also posited an opposition that existed from the beginning of the world between two principal spirits, Spenta Mainyu, 'the incremental spirit', and Angra Mainyu, 'the fiendish spirit' as stated in stanza 3. They, in turn, reflect a dualism beween Ashu 'Truth' and Angra 'Falsehood'. Human beings choose between these, as did the Daevas -- god-like beings who chose Falsehood. Their resulting status is in direct opposition to that in Indian religion, in which the devas make up the accepted pantheon. But the one who accepts Ahura Mazda is strengthened by Armaiti, 'Devotion'. The rewards or retribution for one's choice are stated graphically in stanzas eight through twelve.

Translation
1	 	And I shall proclaim, O seekers [of Truth], those things
 	 	           which [are] to be borne in mind, even for one knowing [them already]:
 	 	[Those] praises and hymns of Good Mind [to be sung] for the Lord and,
 	 	           attentive ones, for Truth,
 	 	Which by [their] lights [will bring] joys beautiful to see.
 	 	 
2	 	Listen with [your] ears to the best things [said]
 	 	           [And] observe with [your] mind, radiant,
 	 	The two alternatives of [your] choosing, each man for himself
 	 	Being careful to announce us to Him1 before the great retribution.
 	 	 
3	 	There are two primeval spirits, twins who are revealed
 	 	           [to us] through dream.
 	 	In mind, in speech, and even in deed they are better and bad:
 	 	The good choose between them correctly, not the evil.
 	 	 
4	 	And what's more, when these two spirits came together
 	 	           at the beginning of the world,
 	 	They bestowed [to it] both life and death. And likewise
 	 	At the end, a life most wicked will arise for followers of the Lie,
 	 	           and the best thought [will arise] for the followers of Truth.
 	 	 
5	 	Of these two spirits, the one possessed of the Lie chose to execute
 	 	           the most wicked things, [but] the beneficent spirit,
 	 	Who is clothed in the hardest stones, [chose] Truth,
 	 	[Just as those men do now] who readily satisfy the Lord, the Wise One,
 	 	           with true actions.
 	 	 
6	 	The Daevas did not choose correctly whatsoever between these two,
 	 	           since Deception approached them [as they were] deliberating [between
 	 	           them].
 	 	[And] since they chose the worst thought,
 	 	They thereby rushed headlong unto [that very] wrath by which they [now] poison
 	 	           the life of mortal men.
 	 	 
7	 	Yet He1 goes unto him2 with power, Good Mind, and Truth,
 	 	And youthful Armaiti gives [him] body [and] breath.
 	 	[And each] of these things will arise for you, [too], just as through retribution
 	 	           by molten iron the former [followers of the Lie (?)
 	 	           will be punished].
 	 	 
8	 	And so, when the punishment of these sins will arrive
 	 	Then dominion will finally obtain for You, O Wise One,
 	 	           through Good Thinking.
 	 	[In order] to proclaim, O Lord, to those who will
 	 	           give Deceit over to the Truth in both hands.
 	 	 
9	 	Therefore, may we be the ones who would make existence vibrant,
 	 	O Wise [Lord] and Lords, by means of the unbroken support [you have given?]
 	 	      to me2 and by means of Truth,
 	 	So that our minds will remain unified whenever our judgment may be in doubt.
 	 	 
10	 	For then the destruction of the prosperity of Deceit will descend
 	 	And the swiftest [steeds] will be yoked to the dwelling place of Good Mind,
 	 	Which will race ahead unto the good fame of the Wise One and of Truth.
 	 	 
11	 	When you, O mortals, learn those rules which the Wise One has given,
 	 	[When you learn that there is] freedom and constraint, and [likewise]
 	 	      long-lasting destruction for the Possessors of the Lie,
 	 	But blessings for the Truthful, then through these things [you have learned]
 	 	      the things that you desire will arise.
Grammar
16 Noun Stems in Sibilants and Stops
16.1 n-stem Nouns
Avestan has n-stem nouns in an, man, and van, whose declensions vary only by the strength of the stem. Stems in an generally show ablaut, extending to ān in cases that take a strong stem. This is not, however, consistent: some words follow this pattern while others do not, perhaps on analogy with man- and van-stems for which ablaut is unattested.

The paradigms given here include the ablaut.

Singular:	 	Masculine manθran- 'poet-priest'	 	Neuter nāman- 'name'
Nom.	 	manθrā	 	nąma
Acc.	 	*manθrā, *manθrānəm	 	nąma

Abl.pl	 	*manθrabyō	 	*nāmabyō
Gen.pl	 	*manθranąm	 	nāmanąm
16.2 r/n-stem Nouns
Avestan includes a few stems that end in r or n, depending on the case in which they appear.

Singular:	 	Masculine nar- 'man'	 	Neuter rāzar- 'declaration'
Nom.	 	nā	 	rāzar
Acc.	 	narəm	 	*rāzar
Dat.	 	narai	 	unattested
Gen.	 	nrš	 	rāzanh
Plural:	 	 	 	 
Nom.	 	narō	 	*rāzār
Acc.	 	nrnš	 	unattested
Gen.	 	*narąm	 	*rāznąm
17 Relative and Interrogative Pronouns
The relative and interrogative pronouns, ya- and ka-, respectively, decline similarly in Avestan. The interrogative also has a stem ci- that appears only in the nominative singular form ciš. The relative paradigm is given here.

ya-declension	 	Masculine	 	Feminine
Nom. sg.	 	yō	 	yā
Acc. sg.	 	yim, yəm	 	yąm, yām
Instr. sg.	 	yā	 	unattested
Dat. sg.	 	yahmai	 	unattested
Abl. sg.	 	yahmāṯ	 	yen̨hāṯ, yen̨hāda
Gen. sg.	 	yahya, yen̨he	 	yen̨haē
Loc. sg.	 	yahmi	 	yen̨he
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. du.	 	yā	 	 
Gen. du.	 	yayaē	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. pl.	 	yoi	 	yaē
Acc. pl.	 	yąn	 	yaē
Instr. pl.	 	yāiš	 	unattested

Gen. pl	 	yaēšąm	 	yaēn̨hąm
Loc. pl.	 	yaēšu	 	yāhu, yāhva
The neuter differs from the masculine in only the nominative and accusative cases:

Nom.Acc. sg.	 	yaṯ
Nom. du.	 	yā
Nom.Acc. pl.	 	yā
18 The Perfect Tense
In addition to the present and aorist stems encountered in previous lessons, Avestan also has a perfect stem which is formed by the reduplication of the root. Generally, this reduplication is created by adding the vowel of the underlying root and any consonant immediately preceding that vowel to the front of the root. Exceptions to this rule are as follows:

Diphthongs ending in i or u reduplicate in i or u, respectively.
The initial consonant c changes to k in the root syllable, e.g. cit 'think', cikait-.
Initial k reduplicates as c, e.g. kan 'desire, cakan.
Consonant clusters omit all but the initial consonant, e.g. vraz 'be joyful', vavraz-.
The root vid 'see, know' is not reduplicated.
The root takes full grade in the singular present indicative active and all forms of the subjunctive; zero grade, elsewhere.

In these lessons, the perfect has been translated with past sense, e.g. ṯaṯašā 'has fashioned'.

Perfect Paradigm

Since no root forms more than one perfect conjugation, the convention of using a single root per paradigm is not followed here.

Indicative	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	dadarəša	 	susruye
2 sg.	 	dadāθa	 	unattested
3 sg.	 	cakana	 	dāta
 	 	 	 	 
3 du.	 	unattested	 	mamanāite, dazde
 	 	 	 	 
1 pl.	 	didvišma	 	unattested
3 pl.	 	caxnar	 	unattested
 	 	 	 	 
Subjunctive	 	 	 	 
2 pl.	 	vavrazaθa	 	unattested
 	 	 	 	 
Optative	 	 	 	 
3 sg.	 	vidyāṯ	 	unattested
19 The Perfect Active Participle
The perfect tense also has active and middle participles. The active form is built by adding the suffix vas, weak grade uš, to the reduplicated stem. Feminines add ī and decline accordingly. Masculines decline thus:

 	 	vid/vidvas 'having known'
Nom. sg.	 	vidvå
Dat. sg.	 	vidušai
Gen. sg.	 	vidušō
The present middle participle is formed by adding the ending ana to the perfect stem, which declines according to the a/ā-paradigms in Section 3.

Perfect participles are translated with the verb 'having', as in vidvå 'having known', nominative singular masculine.

20 Relative-Correlative Syntax
Native English speakers sometimes find the Indo-Iranian relative clause difficult because it is not usually embedded within the main clause, as it is in English, but rather precedes the main clause, which 'picks up' the relative pronoun with a corresponding demonstrative, or correlative, pronoun. The relative pronoun may be placed anywhere within its own clause, though it is often found at the beginning. The correlative must begin the main clause. The antecedent, or the word that the relative pronoun represents in the relative clause, also (somewhat counter-intuitively) appears in the relative clause, usually immediately after the relative pronoun.

The relative clause aēibyō sastē ... yōi ašai dadən ... drujəm, taken from stanza 8 above, provides an illustration:

 	 	aēibyō	 	sastē	 	yōi	 	ašai	 	dadən	 	drujəm
 	 	to those	 	to proclaim	 	to whom	 	over to Truth	 	will give	 	Deceit
This is translated into English as "to proclaim to those who will give Deceit over to the Truth."

Lesson 5: Young Avestan
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
In the sixth century B.C. the Persians extended their empire greatly, especially under Darius the Great (521-486 B.C.). Known as the Achaemenian empire, after an earlier Persian ruler, it included the eastern Iranian state, Greater Chorasmic, which was the center of the Zarathustrian religion. As in that religion, Darius [in an Old Persian text inscribed at Behistan] proclaimed his adherence to Ahura Mazda, stating "Ahura Mazda is mine, I am Ahura Mazda's." But he does not refer to Zarathustra, nor to the spirits in that religion. In this way, a modified form of Zarathustrian religion arose, accompanied by other religions practiced by others in the empire. The Magi, priests, fostered it among other religions such as Mithraism. It underwent modifications, as did the language, both of which are represented in the Younger Avesta. Maintaining much of Zarathustra's teaching, it is referred to by the Greek version of his name, Zoroastrianism. As the first line of the hymn indicates, Ahura Mazda retains his prestige in the new religion, but he also acknowledges other gods, like Mithra.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The Hymn to Mithra, dated in the second half of the fifth century, provides an extensive account of the god, his cult, and his attributes. Included in the Rigvedic hymns, he must have been worshipped also a millennium earlier. There, as Mitra, he is paired with Varuna in many poems to Mitravaruna. In his book, The Avestan Hymn to Mithra (Cambridge University Press, 1967), Ilya Gershevitch cites Mitra's characteristics as summarized by A. A. Macdonell in A Vedic Reader for Students (Oxford University Press, 1917). Especially pertinent among these, for the interpretation of the initial stanzas of the hymn that are included here, is his role as upholder of truth, order, and contracts. The word mithra means 'contract' in Avestan. As Ahura Mazda informs Zarathustra in the second stanza, one cannot break a contract -- even with a rogue. Mitra's abode with Varuna is "golden and is located in heaven... great, very lofty, firm, with a thousand columns and a thousand doors" (Macdonell 1917: 118). His realm, described as vouru gaoyaoiti, literally 'having wide cattle-pastures', is in accordance with his role as protector of the cow. Benefits derived from his worship are indicated in the remainder of the verses here. These, as well as his worship, make up the 145 stanzas of the hymn.

Translation
1 Ahura Mazda said unto Zarathustra Spitama: And when I created Mithra, who has vast fields, I created him [to be] as worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of praise, as I, Ahura Mazda [am] my very self. 2 A [single] rogue, unfaithful to a contract, brings ruin upon the entire country, O Spitama -- as much [ruin] as some one hundred evil-doers, slayers of Truthful men. Do not break a covenant, O Spitama, which you would negotiate with a follower of the Lie, nor with a follower of the Truth who has found the good religion, for a convenant is valid for both the follower of the Lie and the follower of the Truth alike. 3 Mithra, who has vast fields, gives swift horses to [those] who do not break a covenant. Fire, [the servant?] of Ahura Mazda, gives the straightest path to [those] who do not break a covenant. The good, strong, [and] beneficent Fravashis of the followers of Truth give virtuous progeny to [those] who do not break a covenant. 4 Indeed, because of his radiance and glory, I shall offer to this Mithra, who has vast fields, a song of praise worthy of being heard, together with libations ... 6 I shall worship with libations this Mithra [who is] strong, worthy of sacrifice, mighty, [and] the most powerful of all creatures. I shall approach him with honor and reverence. I shall offer to this Mithra, who has vast fields, a song of praise worthy of being heard, together with libations. We sacrifice to Mithra, who has vast fields, with a meat offering [placed] between two haoma stalks, with sacrificial grass, with thought and word and deed, and with libations and rightly-spoken words ... 7 We worship Mithra, who has vast fields, whose speech is true, [who is] eloquent, with a thousand ears, [who is] well fashioned, with ten thousand eyes, [who is] great, well-procured, sleepless, [and] continuously awake ... 11 whom warriors worship on the backs of [their] horses, asking [for] vigor for [their] teams, vitality for [their] bodies, far-sightedness with respect to those whom they hate, the overcoming of the malevolent, [and] the striking down with a single blow of [their] enemies, adversaries, and those whom they hate.
Grammar
21 r- and r/n-stem Nouns
21.1 tar-stems
Avestan nouns ending in the suffix tar function either as agent nouns designating the performers of actions -- e.g., θvastar- 'fashioner' -- or as relational nouns describing familial ties -- e.g., ptar- (pitar-) 'father'. The two types are differentiated by the grade of their strong stem formations in the nominative and accusative: agent nouns show extended grade; relation nouns, full grade. All other cases form weak grade stems. Masculine and feminine decline similarly.

Masculine	 	dātar- 'creator'	 	ptar- (pitar-) 'father'
Nom. sg.	 	dātā	 	ptā
Acc. sg.	 	dātārəm	 	ptarəm
Instr. sg.	 	*dātrā	 	*ptrā
Dat. sg.	 	*dāθrāi	 	piθrai/fəδrai
Gen. sg.	 	*dāθr̥š	 	*piθr̥š
 	 	 	 	 
Nom. pl.	 	dātārah	 	unattested
Acc. pl.	 	*dātr̥nš	 	ptr̥nš
Gen. pl.	 	*dātrąm	 	ptrąm
Voc. pl.	 	unattested	 	*pitarah
21.2 r/n-stems
Masculine nouns in ar -- e.g., nar 'man' -- decline much like relational nouns in tar, except for the stem ātar 'fire', root āt + suffix ar, with nominative singular masculine ātarš in Young Avestan and accusative singular ātr̥m alongside the more regular ātarəm. It is supposed that this form was originally a neuter. Feminines do not appear.

Masculine	 	nar- 'creator'
Nom. sg.	 	nā
Acc. sg.	 	narəm
Dat. sg.	 	*niθrai
Gen. sg.	 	nr̥š
 	 	 
Nom. pl.	 	narah, unattested
Acc. pl.	 	nr̥nš
Gen. pl.	 	*nrąm
Neuter stems in ar have r/n alternation in the formation of the genitive case, except for the singular audr̥š > audar 'cold', followed by enclitic ca 'and'.

Neuter	 	rāzar- 'declaration'
Nom. sg.	 	rāzar
Gen. sg.	 	rāzanh
 	 	 
Nom. pl.	 	*rāzār
Gen. pl.	 	rāšnąm
22 Possessive Pronouns
Possessive pronouns based on personal pronouns appear in Old Avestan with adjectivival function. They are formed in the singular by adding the suffix a to the m-, tu-, and hu-stems of the first, second, and third person pronouns, respectively, with second person tu- > θu. Plural attestations are found only in the first and second person and are built by adding āka to the stems az- and yu-. Third person and neuter forms of all genders appear rarely and in only a small number of cases. They are therefore not included here.

Masculine	 	First Person	 	Second Person
Nom. sg.	 	mah	 	θvah
Instr. sg.	 	mā	 	θvā
Dat. sg.	 	mahmāi	 	θvahmāi
Abl. sg.	 	unattested	 	θvahmāṯ
Gen. sg.	 	mahya	 	θvahya
Loc. sg.	 	mahmi	 	θvahmi
 	 	 	 	 
Acc. pl.	 	ahmākanh	 	yušmakam
Instr. pl.	 	ahmākaiš	 	šmakā
Dat. pl.	 	unattested	 	yušmakāi
Gen. pl.	 	unattested	 	yušmakahya
 	 	 	 	 
Feminine	 	 	 	 
Nom. sg.	 	unattested	 	θvai
Gen. sg.	 	mahyāh	 	θvahyāh
Loc. sg.	 	unattested	 	θvāhu
 	 	 	 	 
Acc. pl.	 	unattested	 	šmākām
23 The Imperfect
Avestan includes the use of a simple preterite, or past tense called the imperfect. It is part of the present system, because it is made by adding characteristic endings to the present stem. It conveys past action and may be translated with either a simple or continuous sense, e.g., baraṯ from bar 'bear, support, carry', as 'he carried' or 'he was carrying'.

Imperfect	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	barəm	 	baire
2 sg.	 	*barō	 	*baran̨ha
3 sg.	 	baraṯ	 	barata
 	 	 	 	 
1 du.	 	*barāva	 	unattested
3 du.	 	baratəm	 	*baraētəm, barōiδe
 	 	 	 	 
1 pl.	 	barāma, barama	 	unattested
2 pl.	 	*barata	 	*baradvəm
3 pl.	 	barən	 	*barən̨ta
24 Passive Constructions
Passive stems include finite verbal formations in both the present and aorist systems. The present passive stem is formed by adding the suffix -ya to the root in its full grade, to which a middle ending is added; e.g., baryate < bar 'it was borne'. The aorist passive occurs only in the third person singular. It is formed by adding the ending -ī to the full grade of root; e.g., mraoī < mru 'it was told'.

A past participle passive is also found in Avestan. It is formed by adding either the suffix -ta or, more rarely, -na to the root, which usually appears in its weak grade; e.g., gušta- < guš 'hear', uxta- < vak 'speak'. A small number of roots add i before the suffix, e.g. zairita- < zar 'be/make angry.

As noted in Section 14, a participle is a verbal adjective and thus has adjectival inflection. Since the past participle passive ends in a, it declines accordingly (cf. Section 3).

25 Zarathustrianism and Zoroastrianism, Gathic Avestan and Younger Avestan
As noted in the Introduction, there is a considerable difference in doctrine between the Gathas, which are exemplified in lessons 1-4, and the Yasts or hymns, such as to Mithra herein and to Haoma in lesson 6. The Gathas present the doctrines preached by Zarathustra, whose dates are disputed, though roughly from 630-553 B.C. But the texts themselves, composed in an archaic dialect of Avestan, may be much older. The Yasts and other texts are dated from the second half of the fifth century B.C. To distinguish the differences in doctrine between the two sets of texts, the terms Zarathustrianism and Zoroastrianism have been introduced. Zarathustrianism is considered to represent the teaching of the prophet; it is monotheistic, featuring dualism between Truth and Falsehood, and between the Incremental Spirit and the Fiendish Spirit. The one god, Ahura Mazda, has created seven spiritual aspects of himself -- Amesha Spentas, who are representatives of man, cattle, fire, metal, earth, water, and plants.

The later religion is mixed, reflecting the expansion of the Achaemenian Empire under Darius I, who was king of Persia from 521-486 B.C. He apparently came to know the religion when its territory was conquered by the Persians and, recognizing Ahura Mazda as their chief god, took him over. But the Persians did not mention Zarathustra, and their priests were open to allowing worshippers to pay their reverence to Mithra, Anahita and the chief gods of other cults as well as to Ahura Mazda. This mixed religion spread widely; to distinguish it from the older religion, it was given the name Zorastrianism based on the Greek version of the name.

The language of the two periods also varies in details. The Later or Younger Avestan exhibits grammatical changes such as the use of the relative particle ya- also as an article. On the whole these changes are minor, with the basic grammars being the same.

Reading and Textual Analysis
This hymn glorifies Haoma -- on the one hand a yellow, milky liquid, on the other a priest serving Mithra. Highly prominent in the Rigveda as Soma, he is described in stanzas 88 to 90 of the Hymn to Mithra as a "healer, beautiful, majestic and golden-eyed, worshipped on the highest peak of Hara the high, ...whom Ahura Mazda installed as promptly-sacrificing, loud-chanting priest. He was the first mortar-priest to elevate the star-decked, supernaturally fashioned Haoma-stalks on the high Hara" (Gershevich 1967: 115-117). This hymn praises the liquid, its source in the mountains, and its effects. The Rigvedic hymn to Soma, 8:48, is laudatory, as in the first stanza followed by fourteen more: "I have partaken wisely of the sweet food that stirs good thoughts, best banisher or care, to which all gods and mortals, calling it honey, come together" (Macdonell 1917:155). Presumably created as stated here by a god, it may have been a center of worship already in Indo-Iranian, possibly even in Indo-European, times. Many attempts have been made to identify its source. According to some it was the juice of the rhubarb whose leaves turn yellow; to others, it was some kind of honey mead. But neither identification seems to accord with the description in this hymn, where it is a liquid that is derived from a plant pressed between two stones, and neither suggestion is likely for an intoxicating liquid with healing properties. With no historical record of its role in either Indian or Iranian worship, we can do little but interpret the words of the hymns.

Translation
2 I praise with speech, O you who are filled with inspiration, your lower pressing stone, which presses together the forces of life. I praise with speech, O you who are filled with inspiration, your upper pressing stone, with which I, a man, pound forcefully.
3 I praise both the cloud and the rain by which you acquire bodily form, causing [your] growth around the peaks of mountains. I praise the high mountains where, O Haoma, [you are infused] with growth.
4 Far and wide I praise the earth -- broad, vast, fertile -- [that is] your noble womb, O Haoma. I praise the earth's mountain where, O swift [intoxicant?], you grow fragrant. And [thus] may you grow upon that mountain, O Haoma, [bringing] the increase of wisdom...
5 Through my words may you grow in every root, every sprout, and every branch.
6 When praised, Haoma grows, so we who would praise Him become more victorious fighters. Even the lightest touch, O Haoma, even the faintest praise, O Haoma, even the smallest sip, O Haoma, is [carried out] for the sake of deaths by the thousands of daevas.
7 By means of the prepared [stalk], corruption disappears forever from the house wherein one would always bear up, wherein one would always extol, the manifest healing property of restorative Haoma.
8 For all other intoxicants bring on the madness of a bloody club, but that intoxication which belongs to Haoma brings about the Truth...
10 Inspired, the god created you, a swift steed given to creation. Inspired, the god set you down on high Haraiti, a swift steed given to creation.
11 Then the tutelary birds there carried you off in every direction...
12 And there on those mountains you, the milky, yellow-haired Haoma, are spread out. Your invigorating juices overflow for those of good mind.
Grammar
26 Root Nouns and Sibilant-Stems
Avestan exhibits a class of root nouns to whose endings an inflection is added directly. Root nouns appear in all three genders, with masculine and neuter declensions that vary only slightly. The feminine stem adds the final vowel ī and declines accordingly.

Neuter nouns in h are also found, deriving from Proto-Indo-Iranian s-stems, which some phonological contexts preserve (e.g., manah nominative singular 'mind', but manas ca 'and mind'). Such nouns are commonly, though not necessarily, root nouns, and thus decline similarly, but nasalizing the stem's final syllable in strong cases. Adjectival forms appear, as do perfect active participles in vah and comparatives in yah. These decline in all three genders according to the root noun paradigm, excepting the nominative singular which lengthens the vowel in the final syllable (e.g., sumanāh 'having a good mind').

27 The Future Passive Particple and the Infinitive
27.1 Avestan builds a future passive participle, or gerundive, by adding the suffix -tva or -ya directly to the root and declining accordingly. The form may be translated as 'to be done' (e.g., varya- 'the thing to be chosen' or 'the right choice'), or more fluidly (e.g., aujya- 'praiseworthy').

27.2 An infinitive is a verbal noun expressing tenseless action as an abstract concept. For example, in the English sentence "I want to read Avestan texts," the infinitive 'to read' -- a generalized action that takes place at no particular time -- is the object of the verb. Avestan forms its infinitive by adding one of a number of consonantal or syllabic endings to a present or aorist stem, and occasionally to a desiderative (see Section 28); this new stem is then declined as a dative singular masculine. Since the dative form is consistent, it may be easier to think of infinitive endings as a set of suffixes added to a verbal stem: -dyai, -ai, -tai, -hai, -sai, manai, and vai.

Some examples:

dar	 	'hold, support'	 	drdyai	 	present stem
pā	 	'protect'	 	pai	 	present stem
gam	 	'go'	 	gatai	 	present stem
vac	 	'speak, say'	 	vaucahai	 	thematic aorist stem
dəbąz	 	'support'	 	dibzadyai	 	desiderative stem
A rare nominative singular infinitive form in -h is also found; e.g., ava 'help', avah 'to help'.

28 The Future Tense and Derivative Conjugations
28.1 Future Tense as Action
The future tense conveys action that will occur some time after the speaker verbalizes it. As with the present tense, it may be translated using either a general sense, as in "Very soon Zarathustra will sing," or with a continuous sense, "At noon, Zarathustra will be singing."

Though rare in Old Avestan, which typically uses a subjunctive form to express future time, the future tense becomes somewhat more frequent in the younger language. Stems of the future system are built very simply by adding either -hya- or -sya- to a verbal root, which is usually found in its middle grade. The stems take primary endings.

Future Paradigms: vac- 'speak, say'

 	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	vaxš̨āmi, vaxš̨ā (Gathic only)	 	unattested
3 sg.	 	unattested	 	vaxš̨ete
 	 	 	 	 
3 pl.	 	unattested	 	vaxš̨ən̨te
28.2 Future Active and Middle Participles
Future active and middle participles are formed by adding -ant- and -amna- or -ana-, respectively, to the future stem. The form is relatively rare, though found based on several roots. E.g., saušyant- '(the one who) will be saving', or 'savior', from sū 'save'.

28.3 Causatives, Desideratives, and Intensives
Several verbal forms that can appear in any tense are derived by augmenting a stem to form a distinctive base. Causatives, desideratives, and intensives are seen.

The causative is formed by adding the suffix -aya- to the stem in its strongest grade: tap 'be hot', present stem tāpaya- 'cause to be hot', 'heat'; var 'believe', aorist stem vauraya- 'cause to believe', 'convince'.

The desiderative is formed by reduplicating the root and adding the suffix -sa: ji 'conquer', jijiša- 'desires to conquer'. With a few exceptions, the form is confined to the present stem, appearing in various roots in the indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods, as well as the participle.

The intensive is formed differently for thematic and athematic roots. Both are reduplicated. Thematic roots and their reduplication take their strongest grade; athematic roots appear in the weak grade, with the reduplicated syllable in the middle: thematic dis 'show', daidais- and athematic kar 'do, make', karkər. As the name suggests, the form is translated to convey an intensified or urgent sense.

29 Avestan Texts, Grammars, and Dictionaries
A compact survey of handbooks on the texts and other works on the Iranian languages is "The Iranian Languages," by Nicholas Sims-Williams, in The Indo-European Languages, ed. by Anna Giacalone Ramat and Paolo Ramat (London and New York: Routledge, 1998), pp. 125-153. It includes numerous references. Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum, ed. by Rüdiger Schmitt (Wiesbaden: Reichert, 1989) provides a fuller survey of the field, including essays by Manfred Mayrhofer on the pre-history of the Iranian languages (pp. 4-24, in German), by Jean Kellens on Avestan (pp. 32-55, in French), and by Schmitt on Old Persian (pp. 56-85, in German), among many others. And the Grundriss der iranischen Philologie, vols. I and II, ed. by Wilhelm Geiger and Ernst Kuhn (Strassburg: Trübner, 1895-1904) is still worth consulting.

Among works on the texts, The Gathas of Zarathustra by Stanley Insler (Leiden: Brill, 1975) provides translations as well as commentary. The Gathas of Zarathushtra and Other Old Avestan Texts, by Helmut Humbach (2 vols., Heidelberg: Winter), is more inclusive. See also The Avestan Hymn to Mithra, by Ilya Gershevitch (Cambridge University Press, 1967); and Avesta: The Sacred Books of the Parsis by Karl F. Geldner (3 vols., Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1886-1896), with the text in the original script, is still considered the standard edition. The standard grammar, if limited to phonology and morphology, is An Avestan grammar in comparison with Old Indian. Part I, Phonology, Inflection, Word-formation, with an introduction to the Avesta by A. V. Williams Jackson (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1892). Jackson also published A Short Grammar of Old Persian (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1936). More recent works are A Grammar of Gatha-Avestan, by Robert S. P. Beekes (Leiden: Brill, 1988) and Avestische Laut- und Flexionslehre, by Karl Hoffmann and Bernhard Forssman (Innsbruck: Institut für Sprachwissenschaft der Universität Innsbruck, 1996).

The standard dictionary is Altiranisches Wörterbuch, by Christian Bartholomae (Strassburg: Trübner, 1904).

30 The Avestan Legacy
The Old Persian materials, which will be taken up in the next lesson, are of primary interest for their historical and linguistic information. By contrast, the Avestan texts, which provide the works of Zoroaster, have given rise to a massive set of publications; they are also the basis of the present-day Parsee religion. A work devoted to the figure himself is A. V. Williams Jackson's Zoroaster, the Prophet of Ancient Iran (New York, 1899). A broader work is The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism, by R. C. Zachner (1961).



Lesson 7: Old Persian
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
Behistan -- Modern Bistin, Old Persian Bagastana, or 'place of the gods' -- lies in a gorge about sixty-five miles to the west of Hamadan, Iran, along the ancient caravan route between Baghdad and Tehran. A trilingual inscription (Elamite, Akkadian, and Old Persian), narrating the defeat of ten rebel kings, is carved near the ancient settlement on the face of the northern cliff, about 225 feet above the ground. Accompanying sculptural reliefs depict the same events with the Emperor Darius I (ca. 521 - 486 BC), flanked by two attendants, standing before a line of nine captives. His right foot is planted firmly on the prostrate figure of Gaumata, the tenth rebel king, while the god Ahura Mazda looks on from above. The Old Persian inscription consists of five columns surrounded by minor reliefs depicting the persons and events described in each column.

Reading and Textual Analysis
In column four, Darius wraps up his narration of events and turns to address future emperors of the Persian realm. Though the modern reader may be struck by his excessive bravado ("Among those [who] were earlier kings, not as much was done thus by them as was done by me..."), it is likely that he was primarily concerned with establishing and/or legitimating Persian claims on subjected lands. Several times in as many lines he makes the point that his deeds were done "by the will of Ahura Mazda" and that future kings must do as he has done if they are to retain sovereignty. He also insists on the truth of his words, that he did indeed do all that he claimed, with a rhetoric that places his deeds on a par with the "cosmic truths" of Zoroastrian religion. Like the latter, the conquests of Darius are to be both imitated and declared to all, and if any successor does not do so, Darius warns, he will be likened to a follower of the Lie and abandoned by Ahura Mazda.

Translation
36 Darius the King declares: 37 You who will be king hereafter, protect yourself from the Lie steadfastly. 38 The man who would be a follower of the Lie, punish him well if 39 you would think thus: 'Let my realm be secure.' 40 Darius the King declares: This is what I did, 41 [and] by the will of Ahura Mazda I did [it] in this very [time frame] of [one] year. You who will 42 hereafter read this inscription, may what was done by me persuade 43 you lest you think it deceit. Darius the King declares: 44 I turn myself quickly to Ahura Mazda, as this [is] true, not false, 45 [this that] I did in the very [time frame] of [one] year ...
50 ... Darius the King declares: Among those 51 [who] were earlier kings, not as much was done thus by them 52 as was done by me in the very [time frame] of [one] year by the will of Ahura Mazda. 53 Now, let what was done by me persuade you. 54 [And] thus, on account of the people, do not conceal [the deeds carved here]. If 55 you do not conceal this record [but] declare [it] among the people, Ahura Mazda 56 will become your friend, a large family will be [yours], and [your] life will be long. 57 Darius the King declares: [And] if you do conceal this record 58 [and] declare [it] not among the people, may Ahura Mazda become your smiter and may your family 59 not be born. Darius the King declares: This is what I did, 60 [and] by the will of Ahura Mazda I did [it] in this very [time frame] of [one] year. Ahura Mazda bore me aid 61 as did the other gods who exist. Darius 62 the King declares: [And] on account of this Ahura Mazda bore [me] aid as did the other 63 gods who are: because I was not hostile, I was not a follower of the Lie, 64 I was not an evil man -- not I, not [any] of my family. In accordance with Truth did I behave. 65 Neither to the weak nor to the powerful did I do harm. The man who collaborated 66 with my court, him I bore well; [and the man] who did damage, him 67 I punished severely. Darius the King declared: You who will be king 68 hereafter, the man who would be a follower of the Lie, or who would be an evil man, 69 to them you must not become a friend; you must punish [them] most severely.
Grammar
1 The Old Persian Alphabet
The Old Persian inscriptions are recorded in cuneiform, or 'wedge-shaped' characters based on those of the Akkadian syllabary invented in ancient Mesopotamia. Their relative simplicity suggests that they were quite deliberately modified for representing the Old Persian, and were perhaps even specifically developed for the royal inscriptions on which they are found. Each of thirty-six syllabic characters represents either a vowel or a consonant plus a vowel -- i.e., a complete syllable. In addition, there are five ideograms, or single characters that represent entire words. The script is read from left to right.

The syllabary is presented here in Roman transliteration. Each character appears in its standardized order and has been given alphabetic rather than syllabic form. Thus, distinct characters sharing the same initial consonantal phoneme but having different following vowels are transliterated by a common single consonant and the appropriate vowel (e.g., da, di, and du are seen as da, di, and du, respectively). The number of distinct characters is thereby reduced. Each character's approximate pronunciation is illustrated by a word articulated according to standard American English, unless otherwise noted.

Letter	 	Sound	 	Letter	 	Sound	 	Letter	 	Sound
a	 	gutter	 	k	 	kipper	 	y	 	youth
ā	 	father	 	x	 	Ger. Loch	 	r	 	room
i	 	sit, Ger. bitte	 	c	 	It. ciao	 	l	 	lump
ī	 	me	 	j	 	jest; medially azure	 	v	 	vice; medially, werewolf
u	 	book	 	t	 	time	 	 	 	 
ū	 	choose	 	θ	 	theater	 	s	 	sound
 	 	 	 	ç	 	tse tse fly	 	š	 	shout
 	 	 	 	d	 	dime	 	z	 	zoo
 	 	 	 	n	 	never	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	p	 	pour	 	h	 	horse
 	 	 	 	f	 	fair	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	b	 	boar	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	m	 	moot	 	 	 	 
The length of initial vowels is not indicated in the original inscriptions but has been determined, for the most part, through etymological comparison and morphological reconstruction. It is represented throughout these lessons accordingly. The inherent vowels of consonantal syllables in the inscriptions are transcribed here by a short vowel; long medial vowels and diphthongs show an original consonantal syllable plus following vowel.

2 The Old Persian Sound System
2.1 Phonology
The phonemic system of Old Persian is considerably less complex than that of the older sister dialects Old and Younger Avestan. Middle vowels and aspirated stops have dropped from the language entirely; the number of nasals and sibilants has been reduced. The following chart represents the phonemes of Old Persian in their totality.

Vowels:	 	Front	 	Central	 	Back
High	 	i, ī	 	 	 	u, ū
Low	 	 	 	a, ā	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Consonants:	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Unvoiced	 	Voiced	 	Nasals	 	Unvoiced	 	Unvoiced	 	Voiced
 	 	Stops	 	Stops	 	 	 	Fricatives	 	Sibilants	 	Sibilants
Velars:	 	k	 	g	 	 	 	x	 	 	 	 
Palatals:	 	c	 	j	 	 	 	 	 	š	 	medial-z
Cerebrals:	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	ç	 	 
Dentals:	 	t	 	d	 	n	 	θ	 	s	 	initial-z
Labials:	 	p	 	b	 	m	 	f	 	 	 	 
Labial-Dental:	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Semivowels:	 	y, r, l, v
Aspirates:	 	h
2.2 Ablaut
Vowel gradation, or ablaut, occurs in three degrees of length: strong, middle, and weak. The weak grade preserves the pure vowel alone. Middle grade adds an a and full grade adds an ā to the weak vowel. The functional distinctions that this generates are discussed in Section 4, below.

2.3 Sandhi
Orthography suggests that a simple system of sandhi, or rules for a change in pronunciation resulting from the combination of two sounds, was recognized. Thus, for example, doubled phonemes between words -- e.g., āpiš + šim = āpišim and vašnā + apiy = vašnāpiy -- seem to have been merged in pronunciation. Thus, two consonants were 'shortened' in speech and two vowels lengthened. Of course, such combinations may represent a graphic simplification only, but abundant examples of vowel shortening and/or the reversion of semi-vowels to vowels suggest otherwise. In these lessons, words combined through sandhi are written together in the text according to convention but analyzed separately in the analysis sections.

3 Noun Inflection
Like Avestan and most other ancient IE languages, Old Persian is highly inflected. This means that, unlike English in which syntax is primarily governed by word order and the use of prepositions, the functional relationships among the various words in a sentence are expressed by inflections, or endings, added to the stem, or base form, of a noun or adjective.

Old Persian has all the inflectional forms, or cases, of Avestan except the dative, whose function has been taken up by the genitive case. In addition to syntactic function, these inflections each also express the number -- singular or plural -- of the noun to which they adhere. The dual number found in the Avestan dialects seems to have fallen into disuse by Old Persian times, except instances of natural pairs, e.g., gaušā accusative singular masculine 'ears'. Each noun also has an inherent gender -- masculine, feminine, or neuter.

The cases are described as follows:

Case	 	Primary Function	 	English Translation
Nominative	 	Grammatical Subject	 	(subject)
Accusative	 	Direct Object	 	(object)
Instrumental	 	Object of Means	 	by, with
Ablative	 	Object of Origin	 	from, out of, on account of
Genitive	 	Subject of Possession/Indirect Object	 	of/to, toward
Locative	 	Object of Location	 	in, on, upon, over, under, at, etc.
Vocative	 	Object of Address	 	('you', or name of person being addressed)
These functions, however, are not all as distinctive as in the Avestan dialects. This is especially true with regard to the ablative case, whose singular forms have become identical to the instrumental or locative forms of various stems, either through the phonetic development of the language or by analogy with the ablative plural inflection being identical to the instrumental plural inflection. Such morphological and phonetic changes led to a similar conflation on the syntactic level, though the 'object of origin' function is primary.

The nominal inflections applied to nouns and adjectives are classified according to the final letter of the noun's stem. Each stem type takes its own set of inflections, for which paradigms are given through the course of these lessons. For each paradigm, a single word is used to fill-out the paradigm in order to aid memorization. Where no attestation of a particular case exists for the word selected, but is found for other words of the stem type, a reconstructed form is given, marked by a preceding asterisk. Where no attestation of a particular case occurs for any word of the stem type, the form is labelled 'unattested'.

4 Verb Inflection
Like case endings, verbal inflections or conjugations are added to a stem, whose form then conveys the tense of a verb. These endings express person, number, mood, and voice.

The persons are three (first, second, and third), as are the numbers (singular, dual, and plural).

'Mood' refers to the attitude of the speaker towards an action. The indicative mood conveys a merely descriptive sense and is translated with the simple verb. The imperative mood indicates a command. Old Persian also includes two potential moods, a subjunctive and an optative, both conveying a sense of probability. The former suggests either future or volitional meaning, the latter conditional. An injunctive form also remains. Its exclusive function, always in combination with a preceding particle mā, is prohibitive.

'Voice' refers to the nature of the action with respect to the logical subject of a sentence. The active voice indicates direct action in the world. The middle voice signals that a self-reflexive purpose or benefit to the subject motivates the action expressed. The passive is used when the agent of a sentence is not the grammatical subject. This last construction will be taken up in Lesson 9.

The four tenses -- present, aorist, perfect, and future -- are classified by the formation of the stem, to which various sets of endings are added. Each pattern of stem formation creates a system, named for the tense it expresses. The present system is divided into two types, thematic and athematic. The thematic classes are presented below. The athematic classes and the other tense systems will be treated in subsequent lessons.

4.1 The Present Tense
The present tense conveys action that occurs at the time of speaking. It may be translated with either a general sense, as in "Darius the King says," or with a continuous sense, "Darius the King is speaking."

Stems of the present system are built in various ways. Those ending with the theme-vowel -a- are called thematic. This -a- may be added directly to a verbal root or it may be a part of the fuller suffixes -ya- or -aya-. To this stem, a set of primary endings are added.

Thematic Present Paradigms: bara- 'carry, bear'

Indicative	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	*baramiy	 	*baraiy
3 sg.	 	ā-baratiy	 	unattested
3 pl.	 	barantiy	 	unattested
 	 	 	 	 
Imperative	 	 	 	 
2 sg.	 	pari-barā	 	*barahuvā
3 sg.	 	baratuv	 	unattested
 	 	 	 	 
Subjunctive	 	 	 	 
2 sg.	 	*barāhy	 	unattested
3 sg.	 	*barātiy	 	unattested
 	 	 	 	 
Optative	 	 	 	 
2 sg.	 	baraiš	 	unattested
4.2 The Imperfect
The present system also includes a preterite, or past tense, which can be misleading given the name of the system. The tense is called imperfect, and is categorized as part of the present system since it is built to a present stem. Nevertheless, it does convey a past meaning. It is formed by augmenting the stem with a preceding a and adding a set of secondary endings. It may be translated with either a general or continuous sense, as with the examples above: "Darius the King said," or "Darius the King was saying."

Imperfect	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	abaram	 	*abaraiy
3 sg.	 	abarat	 	unattested
3 pl.	 	abaran, abarahan	 	unattested
5 Word Order
The standard word order of Old Persian is Subject-Object-Verb, with the genitive and ablative cases preceding the words that they characterize, as in lines 58-59, above:

 	 	auramazdā	 	tay	 	jatā	 	biyā	 	utā	 	taiy	 	taumā	 	mā biyā
 	 	Ahura Mazda	 	your	 	smiter	 	may become	 	and	 	your	 	family	 	let not be born.
Relative clauses are usually inserted between the object and verb; for example, from line 37:

 	 	tuvam	 	kā	 	xšāyaθiya	 	hya	 	aparam	 	āhy
 	 	You	 	...	 	king	 	who	 	hereafter	 	will be.
When there are two or more subjects or objects, the primary subject or object appears in the expected position and the secondary subject or object follows the verb. An example is found in line 60:

 	 	auramazdā	 	maiy	 	upastām	 	abara	 	utā	 	aniyāha	 	bagāha	 	tyaiy	 	hatiy
 	 	Ahura Mazda	 	me	 	aid	 	bore	 	as did	 	the other	 	gods	 	who	 	exist.
In reality, however, this pattern is not rigidly upheld. Frequently, the words that an author wished to emphasize appeared in the order that he wished to emphasize them, as the common refrain:

 	 	θātiy	 	dārayavauš	 	xšāyaθiya
 	 	[Thus] declares	 	Darius	 	the king



Lesson 8: Old Persian
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
The inscriptions that bequeath to us the Old Persian language were commissioned by the Achaemenid kings, or those of the regnal line descended from Achaemenes, a minor ruler in the region of present-day southwestern Iran. From Achaemenes the line follows through Teispes to Cyrus the Great, who founded the Persian Empire by conquering the Median king Astyages sometime between 559 and 549 B.C. Upon Cyrus' death, his son Cambyses usurped the throne after secretly killing his older brother Smerdis. Cambyses then left the realm to invade Egypt, and nine vassal kings revolted in his absence. The inscription at Behistan records each of these rebellions and the subsequent reconquest by Darius, first cousin to Cambyses, ninth in the line of Achaemenid kings.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The narrative of revolts in the inscription at Behistan, structured by their geographic distance from the imperial center, begins with conquest of the capital by the warrior-priest Gaumata, who won support by claiming to be Smerdis. Upon hearing of this dissidence, Cambyses took his own life and Darius stepped in to restore the kingdom with the aid of a few loyal men (and Ahura Mazda!). Column one records Gaumata's rise to power and Darius' progress over the course of several months, ending with Gaumata's final defeat at the 'fortress' of Sikayauvati in Media.

Translation
26 Darius the King 27 declares: This is what was done by me when the king 28 I did become. The son of Cyrus, of our family, Cambyses by name -- 29 he was the king here. Of that Cambyses [there] was a brother, 30 Smerdis by name, having the same mother and father as Cambyses. And then Cambyses 31 struck down that Smerdis. When Cambyses struck down Smerdis, 32 it did not become known among the people that [he] had struck down Smerdis. And then Cambyses 33 went to Egypt. And when Cambyses went to Egypt, the people grew treacherous, 34 and thus deceit rose rampantly in both Persia and Media and 35 in the [Empire's] other lands. Darius the King declares: Later, 36 there was one man, a Magian, Gaumata by name, and he rose up from Paishiyauvada. 37 [There is] a mountain in Persia named Arakadri. From there, when fourteen days of the month of Viyakhna 38 were completed, he rose up, [and] he deceived the people [saying] thus: 39 "I am Smerdis, the son of Cyrus who [is] brother of Cambyses." 40 Thereupon, all the people became rebellious against Cambyses and went over to him, [Smerdis], 41 Persia and Media and the other lands, [and] he seized the kingdom. 42 Nine days were completed in the month of Garmapada [when] he seized the kingdom thus. 43 And then Cambyses died by his own hand ...
48 ... Darius the king declares: There was no man, 49 neither Persian nor Median nor any among our family who could render that Gaumata 50 kingdom-deprived. The people feared him greatly, 51 lest he would strike down the numerous people who knew him previously as Smerdis; 52 lest he would strike down the people on account of this: "Lest he who would know me [would know that] I am not Smerdis, 53 the son of Cyrus." No one dared to say anything 54 against Gaumata the Magian until I came. After that, 55 I asked Ahura Mazda for help, [and] Ahura Mazda bore me aid. 56 Ten days of the month of Bagayad were completed when, with a small number of men, 57 I struck down that Gaumata the Magian and those men who 58 were his foremost allies. [There was] a fortress called Sikayauvati, a land called Nisaya, 59 in Media, [and] there I struck him down. I seized the kingdom [from] him, [and] by the will 60 of Ahura Mazda, I became king. Ahura Mazda bestowed the kingdom to me.
Grammar
6 Short and Long i- and u-Stem Nouns
Nominal stems in short i and u are not easily distinguished from those in long ī and ū except by comparison with other Indo-Iranian languages. The declensions take identical inflections in all cases of the masculine and feminine and in the oblique cases of the neuter. Long ī- and ū-stem cognates with the Sanskrit are attested, e.g., bumi-, Skt. bhūmī-, but again these do not appear to have had declensions distinctive from the short i- and u-.

7 Personal Pronouns
Fewer Old Persian pronominal forms are attested than in the Avestan. The first and second person are known in only a few declensions, while the third person is found in only the nominative and accusative singular. As in the Avestan, the oblique cases of all personal pronouns form a suppletive system, i.e., they are based on a stem different from that of the nominative case.

7.1 First and Second Person Pronouns
The first and second person pronouns have no inherent gender. The azem- 'I' and tvə̄m- 'you' paradigms are given here, with enclitic forms given in parentheses.

7.2 Third Person Pronouns
The third person pronoun stem hauv- 'he' is found in only its masculine form.

8 Athematic Presents
As noted in Lesson 1, verbs of the present system are based on various stems. Those stems ending with the theme-vowel -a-, called thematic stems, were discussed there. Athematic stems are similarly attested. They are constructed in five distinctive but systematic ways.

The root class stems add their ending directly to the verbal root, e.g. ahmiy 'I am', first person singular present indicative active of ah 'be'. The root may appear in its strong or weak grade, depending on the verb's ablaut pattern (cf. Section 2.2).

The reduplicating class forms its stem by adding a reduplicated syllable to the beginning of a verbal root. Only a few instances of reduplicating class verbs are found in Old Persian: the 1st and 3rd person singular imperfect indicative adadā, from dā 'make'; the 3rd person singular present imperative active dadātuv, from dā 'give'; and the 2nd person singular present imperative middle dīdiy, from dī 'think, see, know'.

The na̱- and nu- classes add a form of -na̱-/-na- or -nau-/-nu- to the root, according to ablaut pattern. A third nasal category, the infix class, is found where the -na- appears inside the root itself in its middle or zero grade.

Athematic Present Paradigms: ah 'be'

9 Causatives and Denominatives
The causative stem -aya- that appears in Avestan conveying the sense of causativity (cf. Section 2.9) is also found in the Old Persian, though it does not necessarily effect a change of meaning: e.g., 3rd person singular imperfect indicative middle agarbāyatā 'he seized', from grab 'seize, grab'. The causative takes the endings of the present system.

A denominative stem is formed from a noun by adding the suffix -ya- to the noun stem. Like the causative, it takes the endings of the present system: patiyāvahyaiy 'I asked for help', from the prefix patiy added to the noun-stem avah- 'aid'.

10 Adverbs, Adpositions, and Preverbs
Old Persian adverbs function as adpositions (prepositions or postpositions) and verbal prefixes. Some function as both, some as one or the other. Adpositions precede or follow the noun they modify, while preverbs are attached immediately to the front of verbs. Some common examples of each are as follows:

Adposition or Verbal Prefix	 	Meaning	 	Case of Governance
ā	 	near	 	Locative
upa	 	up to	 	Accusative
ni	 	down	 	Locative
patiy	 	toward, against	 	Accusative, Instrumental, Locative
pariy	 	around	 	Accusative
parā	 	away	 	Accusative
 	 	 	 	 
Adposition Only	 	Meaning	 	Case of Governance
anuv	 	along, according to	 	Instrumental, Genitive
antar	 	between	 	Accusative
tara	 	through	 	Accusative
pasā	 	after	 	Accusative, Genitive
rādiy	 	on account of	 	Genitive
hacā	 	from	 	Ablative
hadā	 	with	 	Instrumental
 	 	 	 	 
Verbal Prefix Only	 	Meaning
ava	 	down
ud	 	up
niš	 	out
fra	 	forth, toward
vi	 	apart
ham	 	together
Footnotes

1	 	Proto-Indo-Iranian /s/ > Old Persian /h/ in most environments, but not in consonant clusters. Note here that the /m/ in first person ahmi is considered a resonant -- i.e. a sound that functions as a consonant when in a vocalic environment, or as a vowel when in a consonantal environment. Hence, the rule does not apply.
 	 	 
2	 	Final consonants are dropped in Old Persian, but a third person imperfect ending in t and n can be inferred from comparison with other Indo-Iranian languages. Thus, the 3rd singular āha is assumed to have developed out of the earlier form *āhat, and the plural out of *āhan.


Lesson 9: Old Persian
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
The tomb of Darius is located at Naqs-i-rastam, a few miles north of the ancient Persian capital at Persepolis. The second in a series of three other burial chambers with entryways carved, in the shape of Orthodox crosses each roughly seventy-three feet high, into the face of a cliff, it bears a relief of Darius standing at the base of his throne, supported by two lines of fifteen throne-bearers. Darius looks toward an altar; Ahura Mazda looks down from above. There are two inscriptions. Directly behind the Darius figure, 60 lines are carved in Old Persian, translated into 48 lines of Elamite and 36 lines of Akkadian on the adjacent rock. The second inscription flanks the door, with panels in Old Persian, Elamite, Aramaic, and Akkadian. Together, these constitute the Emperor's last public decrees, highlighting his deeds and moral and physical fortitude, both praising the god Ahura Mazda.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The passage behind Darius on the relief panel, called the inscription of Darius at Naqs-i-rastam A (DNa), opens by declaring Ahura Mazda great by virtue of his creation of the earth, sky, and happiness for humankind, and for making Darius the king. It immediately follows with Darius declaring himself and his noble ancestry to posterity and moves on to list the countries that bore him tribute during his reign. The passage then mentions, again, that Darius was made king by his god, but this time adds the reason: Ahura Mazda saw disorder, rebellion, and moral laxity on the earth, and therefore put Darius in charge, presumably to bring the people back into accordance with Zoroastrian teaching. Darius then refers his readers to the relief itself, should they forget just how many lands he conquered: "look at the reliefs [of those] who bear the throne." Their number is carved in stone. The passage closes with a request for Ahura Mazda to continue to protect him and his descendents from harm and, finally, a last command that his subjects never again rise in rebellion.

Translation
1 Great is the god Ahura Mazda, who 2 created this earth, who 3 created this sky, who created mankind, who 4 created happiness for mankind, 5 who made Darius the king, 6 one king of many, 7 one overlord of many. 8 I [am] Darius: great king, 9 king of kings, 10 king of the lands of all men, 11 king on this great earth 12 far and wide, son of Hystaspes 13 an Achaemenid, a Persian, son 14 of a Persian, an Aryan of Aryan descent ...
30 ... Darius the king declares: 31 When Ahura Mazda 32 saw the [peoples of] the earth rising up, 33 he then bestowed it upon me. He 34 made me king, [and therefore] I 35 am king. By the will of Ahura Mazda 36 I put it down in [its] place. 37 They did that which I asked of them, as 38 was my wish. [And] if you would wonder, 39 "How many were those countries 40 which Darius the King 41 held?" look at the reliefs [of those] who 42 bear the throne. Then you will know. 44 "The spear of a Persian man has 45 gone forth a great distance." [And] thus it will become known to you: 46 "A Persian man has done 47 battle far indeed from Persia." Darius the King 48 declares: I did all this which has been done 49 by the will of Ahura Mazda. 50 Ahura Mazda bore me aid 51 until I accomplished the task. 52 May Ahura Mazda protect me from evil, and 53 my house, and this country. This I 54 pray to Ahura Mazda: may Ahura Mazda 55 give this to me.
Grammar
11 r- and n-stem Nouns
11.1 r-stem Nouns
Old Persian nouns ending in the suffix tar function either as agent nouns that indicate the performers of actions -- e.g., jantar- 'slayer' -- or as relational nouns describing familial ties -- e.g., mātar- 'mother'. Based on Sanskrit evidence, a slight variation in declension would be expected in the nominative and accusative cases, but attestations in Old Persian are too few to verify this. The nominative, accusative, and genitive of pitar- 'father' are given here. The feminine mātar- declines similarly. Neuter declensions do not appear.

Nom. sg.	 	pitā
Acc. sg.	 	*pitārām

Old Persian nouns ending in an, man, and van generally function as action nouns. Their masculine and neuter endings are given here. Feminines are not attested.

In Section 7.2, the third person pronoun hauv- 'this' was described as functioning also as a demonstrative in the masculine and feminine. There are two other demonstratve pronouns, i- 'this' and ava- 'that', in masculine, feminine, and neuter declensions. The neuter third person pronoun aita- is also attested.

12.2 Relative Pronouns
Old Persian relative pronouns form a suppletive system, combining the *ha/ta demonstrative system with the *ya relative system of Indo-Iranian. (It happens to be the only pronoun declension that includes a dual form, not shown here.)

hya-declension	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	Feminine
Nom. sg.	 	hya	 	tya	 	hyā
Acc. sg.	 	tyam	 	tya	 	tyām
Instr. sg.	 	unattested	 	tyanā	 	unattested
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nom/Acc. pl.	 	tyaiy	 	tyā	 	imā
Gen.pl	 	imaišām	 	unattested	 	tyaišām
13 The Aorist Tense
As in Avestan, the Old Persian includes an aorist stem. By this time, however, the complexity of the aorist system had been significantly reduced, both in the number of forms and in modal function (cf. Avestan Lesson 3, Section 13 on the injunctive/indicative distinction for the aorist tense). The augment is always included in all moods except the optative, which may employ it or not, and the form conveys a simple past tense no different in meaning from the imperfect.

A sigmatic aorist is formed from the roots paiθ 'engrave' (with the prefix ni), e.g. niyapaišam, and dar 'support', e.g. adaršiy, in the first person singular adaršiyam. The root aorist, shown here, is more common, though still infrequent.

Root Aorist Paradigm: dā 'put, place, create'

Indicative	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	unattested	 	*adamā
3 sg.	 	adāt	 	*adātā
 	 	 	 	 
Imperative	 	 	 	 
2 sg.	 	adāuvā	 	unattested
Optative	 	 	 	 
2 sg.	 	(a)dyā, (a)dyāh	 	unattested
3 sg.	 	(a) dyā, (a)dyāt	 	unattested
14 Verbal Adjectives and Nouns
A participle is a verbal adjective -- a verb stem that takes an adjectival suffix. It functions syntactically as either an adjective modifying a noun, or as a substantive replacing it. Like verbs, participles are formed in the active, middle, and passive voices, and the past, present, and future tenses.

An example of the present participle in English is the word 'running'. In the sentence "The running water is cold," the verb 'run' functions as an adjective to describe 'water'. In Old Persian, the word might also be used as the subject of the sentence to describe someone or something that is running, as in "The running (one) is passing by," but this is unusual in English. Keeping in mind that a participle is adjectival, the common slang phrase "the big, the bad, and the ugly" may illustrate the same principle. Though 'big', 'bad', and 'ugly' are not participles, they are adjectives standing in place of the nouns they modify (e.g., 'the big men', 'the bad men', etc.) -- a usage that participles commonly have in Old Persian.

The present active participle is formed by adding the ending -ant to a present verbal stem, which declines according to the an- paradigm, given in Section 12, in the masculine and neuter. The feminine is formed by weakening the ant-ending to at and adding a long ī. The form then declines accordingly (cf. Section 6). The present middle participle adds the ending -amna to the verbal stem and declines like the a-/ā-stems in Section 3.

In addition to the present active and middle participles, Old Persian employs a perfect and a future passive participle. The perfect passive participle is most commonly formed by adding ta to the zero-grade root, e.g. marta 'dead', from mar 'die', though it is occasionally added to a stronger grade. A few roots add na, also to the zero-grade, instead of ta. The form is translated as a simple past tense verb with adjectival function, e.g. marta 'dead' as seen in line 48 ('[when I am] dead') of Lesson 10. It may also be used substantively, as in karta 'deed', from kar 'do, make', in line 46 of Lesson 10.

The future passive participle adds ata to the zero- or middle-grade root, e.g. θakata- 'past' from θak 'pass'. Despite the name passive, the form only appears in Old Persian with intransitive verbs and is therefore active in meaning.

The infinitive is the only verbal noun formation in Old Persian. It is formed by adding the suffix tanaiy to a middle grade root. It is translated as the English infinitive, e.g. bartanay 'to bear' from bar 'support, bear'.

15 Relative-Correlative Syntax
Native English speakers sometimes find the Indo-Iranian relative clause difficult since it is not usually embedded within the main clause, as it is in English, but rather precedes the clause, which 'picks up' the relative pronoun with a corresponding demonstrative, or correlative, pronoun. The relative pronoun may be placed anywhere within its own clause, though it is often found at the beginning. The correlative must begin the main clause. The antecedent, or the word that the relative pronoun represents in the relative clause, is included, somewhat counter-intuitively, in the relative clause, usually immediately following the relative pronoun.

The relative clause in lines 48 and 49 above provide an illustration:

 	 	aita	 	tya	 	kartam	 	ava	 	visam	 	vašnā	 	auramazdāhā
 	 	this	 	which	 	has been done,	 	that	 	all	 	by the will	 	of Ahura Mazda
This is translated into English as "I did all this which has been done by the will of Ahura Mazda."

Lesson 10: Old Persian
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
Herodotus (7.1) relays a dispute between Darius' sons Artobazanes and Xerxes for succesion to their father's throne. Each made an appeal according to Persian tradition, which held that the eldest son would become the next king. As Darius' first son by his first wife, Artobazanes presented a straightforward case favoring himself, while Xerxes was forced, like a more 'modern' politician, to stretch the meaning of the term 'first-born'. As Darius' first son by Atossa, daughter of Cyrus the Great, whom Darius had married after becoming king, Xerxes claimed that it was he who was the true heir apparent since it was he who was the eldest son of Darius the King while his brother was merely the eldest son of Darius the man. According to Herodotus, Darius found the latter argument more compelling and appointed Xerxes his successor. By Xerxes' own accounts, however, it was Ahura Mazda's desire for Darius to make Xerxes the next king, since he was the greatest of all his sons. It is for this reason alone, Xerxes implies, that he ascended the throne upon his father's death (486 B.C.).

Reading and Textual Analysis
Xerxes' so-called "Daiva Inscription" is carved on four stone tablets that were found in a building located on the southeast corner of the Royal Complex at Persepolis, Darius' and Xerxes' capitol. Of the four, two are in Old Persian, a complete version of 60 lines and a copy stopping in the middle of line 51. Elamite and Akkadian translations of 50 lines each complete the set. The inscription's opening lines are nearly identical to lines 1-6 and 13-15 of Darius' proclamation at Naqs-i-rastam (cf. Lesson 9), but for the necessary changes of name. Lines 13 to 28 then list the countries over which Xerxes held sway "by the will of Ahura Mazda." The selection below begins in the middle of line 28, where Xerxes declares that one of the countries just named rose against him but was defeated when Ahura Mazda bore him aid in putting the rebellion down. In line 35, Xerxes goes on to describe another kind of revolt -- the worship of daivas, or the practice of the old religion overturned by Zarathustra -- that he also put down. The immediate juxtaposition of these two events serves to highlight the integral nature of religion, morality, and politics in the ideology of the time: Ahura Mazda made Xerxes king; therefore it is his responsibility to see that the god's will is done in his kingdom, that the Zoroastrian ritual is carried out and the Zoroastrian teachings are obeyed. The moral component is also reinforced in lines 41-46, where Xerxes declares his righting of other wrongs, again with Ahura Mazda's aid. The king then declares what brings happiness to the living and the dead, namely reverence of and obedience to Ahura Mazda. In closing, Xerxes again copies Darius exactly (cf. DNa 51-5, Lesson 9).

Translation
28 ... Xerxes the King 29 declares: Since [the time] that I 30 have become king, there is among those 31 lands inscribed above [one that] 32 was rising up. And thereupon, Ahura Mazda 33 bore me aid. By the will of Ahura Mazda I struck [that] country 34 down and I [now] put it down in [its] place. 35 And among these lands there was [also] one where 36 the daivas were once worshipped; [but] later, by the will 37 of Ahura Mazda, I uprooted that altar to the daivas, 38 and proclaimed: "The daivas 39 shall not be worshipped!" [Then,] 40 being reverent, I worshipped Ahura Mazda and Truth where the daivas were worshipped once before. 41 And there was yet another thing 42 that had been done for ill, [and] that I 43 made right, [too]. All this that I did, 44 I did by the will of Ahura Mazda. 45 Ahura Mazda bore me aid, 46 as long as I was doing the deed. [And] if you who [would come] 47 after [me] should think, "May I be happy 48 [as long as I am] living, may I be blessed [when I am] dead," 49 [then] on account of that, honor the laws which Ahura Mazda has 50 set down. You, being reverent, should worship Ahura Mazda 51 and Truth. The man who, on account of that, 52 honors the laws which Ahura Mazda sets 53 down, and [who], being reverent, worships Ahura Mazda 54 and Truth, both becomes happy [as long as he is] living 55 and becomes blessed 56 [when he is] dead ...

Neuter nouns in is are seen in nominative and accusative singular hadiš. Masculine proper names in is, e.g., haxāmaniš, are treated as masculine i-stems and decline accordingly.

16.2 Stems in Stops
There are Old Persian noun stems in t, d, p, and θ. The nominative form is found only in napāt 'grandson', preceded by long a: napā. Feminine accusative, instrumental, genitive, and locative forms of each decline similarly, as follows:

Singular:	 	θard- 'year'
Acc.	 	θardam, *auramazdāham
Instr.	 	*θardā
Gen.	 	θarda
Loc.	 	θardiy, *θardiyā
Plural:	 	 
Instr.	 	*θardbiš
17 Compounds
Two types of nominal compound occur in Old Persian. Determinative compounds are made by joining two noun stems together such that the second determines the syntactic function of the first, which therefore remains undeclined. This case relation may be any one of the oblique cases (accusative through locative), e.g., hauma-varga- 'haoma-drinking' (accusative) or arda-stana- 'place of light' (genitive). The case ending on the second stem determines the relation of the whole unit to the other words of the sentence in which it appears.

Exocentric, or possessive-adjectival compounds, are made like determinative compounds but function as possessive adjectives modifying another noun which may or may not be explicity stated; e.g., hama-pitar- 'having the same father', 'they who have the same father', or aspa-cana- 'having a love for horses', 'he who loves horses'.

18 The Perfect Tense and the Passive Verb
Old Persian includes only one perfect form, caxriyā, the third person singular optative active of kar 'do, make'. The form shows reduplication as in the Avestan and Sanskrit, with the zero-grade root preceded by ca. The translation is 'he would have done'.

Passive stems appear in both the present and aorist systems with the suffix ya added to the stem in its normal grade. With two exceptions, an active ending is then added. E.g., abariya 'is born', 3rd person singular imperfect indicative.

19 The Passive and the Sequential Accusative
19.1 The Passive Construction
Sentences employing passive verbal forms, either finite or participial, require the logical subject to be placed in the instrumental case while the direct object becomes the grammatical subject of the verb, putting it in the nominative case, as in tya manā kartam 'what was done by me' beside tya adam akunavam 'what I did'.

19.2 The Sequential Accusative
The final member of any list containing two or more accusative objects has the instrumental case form; e.g., adam auramazdām ayadaiy / artācā... 'I worshipped Ahura Mazda and Truth...', where auramazdām is accusative and artā instrumental. The pattern is standard, though it most likely originated by conflating the instrumental's expression of accompaniment with the common sequence of accusatives: *auramazdām artā hadā 'Ahura Mazda along with Truth' > auramazdām artā ca 'Ahura Mazda and Truth'.

20 Old Persian Texts, Grammars, and Dictionaries
Roland G. Kent's Old Persian: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon (New Haven: American Oriental Society, 1953, 2nd ed.) is the standard work; as the title indicates, it includes the texts as well as the grammar and dictionary. Additional data are provided by Supplement zur Sammlung der altpersischen Inschriften, by Manfred Mayrhofer (Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1978); the Academy has also published a large number of volumes on manifold topics. And Rüdiger Schmitt has provided a new edition of the most extensive text in The Bisitun Inscriptions of Darius the Great: Old Persian Text (London: School of Oriental and African Studies, 1991).

Lesson 5: Young Avestan
Scott L. Harvey, Winfred P. Lehmann, and Jonathan Slocum
In the sixth century B.C. the Persians extended their empire greatly, especially under Darius the Great (521-486 B.C.). Known as the Achaemenian empire, after an earlier Persian ruler, it included the eastern Iranian state, Greater Chorasmic, which was the center of the Zarathustrian religion. As in that religion, Darius [in an Old Persian text inscribed at Behistan] proclaimed his adherence to Ahura Mazda, stating "Ahura Mazda is mine, I am Ahura Mazda's." But he does not refer to Zarathustra, nor to the spirits in that religion. In this way, a modified form of Zarathustrian religion arose, accompanied by other religions practiced by others in the empire. The Magi, priests, fostered it among other religions such as Mithraism. It underwent modifications, as did the language, both of which are represented in the Younger Avesta. Maintaining much of Zarathustra's teaching, it is referred to by the Greek version of his name, Zoroastrianism. As the first line of the hymn indicates, Ahura Mazda retains his prestige in the new religion, but he also acknowledges other gods, like Mithra.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The Hymn to Mithra, dated in the second half of the fifth century, provides an extensive account of the god, his cult, and his attributes. Included in the Rigvedic hymns, he must have been worshipped also a millennium earlier. There, as Mitra, he is paired with Varuna in many poems to Mitravaruna. In his book, The Avestan Hymn to Mithra (Cambridge University Press, 1967), Ilya Gershevitch cites Mitra's characteristics as summarized by A. A. Macdonell in A Vedic Reader for Students (Oxford University Press, 1917). Especially pertinent among these, for the interpretation of the initial stanzas of the hymn that are included here, is his role as upholder of truth, order, and contracts. The word mithra means 'contract' in Avestan. As Ahura Mazda informs Zarathustra in the second stanza, one cannot break a contract -- even with a rogue. Mitra's abode with Varuna is "golden and is located in heaven... great, very lofty, firm, with a thousand columns and a thousand doors" (Macdonell 1917: 118). His realm, described as vouru gaoyaoiti, literally 'having wide cattle-pastures', is in accordance with his role as protector of the cow. Benefits derived from his worship are indicated in the remainder of the verses here. These, as well as his worship, make up the 145 stanzas of the hymn.

Translation
1 Ahura Mazda said unto Zarathustra Spitama: And when I created Mithra, who has vast fields, I created him [to be] as worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of praise, as I, Ahura Mazda [am] my very self. 2 A [single] rogue, unfaithful to a contract, brings ruin upon the entire country, O Spitama -- as much [ruin] as some one hundred evil-doers, slayers of Truthful men. Do not break a covenant, O Spitama, which you would negotiate with a follower of the Lie, nor with a follower of the Truth who has found the good religion, for a convenant is valid for both the follower of the Lie and the follower of the Truth alike. 3 Mithra, who has vast fields, gives swift horses to [those] who do not break a covenant. Fire, [the servant?] of Ahura Mazda, gives the straightest path to [those] who do not break a covenant. The good, strong, [and] beneficent Fravashis of the followers of Truth give virtuous progeny to [those] who do not break a covenant. 4 Indeed, because of his radiance and glory, I shall offer to this Mithra, who has vast fields, a song of praise worthy of being heard, together with libations ... 6 I shall worship with libations this Mithra [who is] strong, worthy of sacrifice, mighty, [and] the most powerful of all creatures. I shall approach him with honor and reverence. I shall offer to this Mithra, who has vast fields, a song of praise worthy of being heard, together with libations. We sacrifice to Mithra, who has vast fields, with a meat offering [placed] between two haoma stalks, with sacrificial grass, with thought and word and deed, and with libations and rightly-spoken words ... 7 We worship Mithra, who has vast fields, whose speech is true, [who is] eloquent, with a thousand ears, [who is] well fashioned, with ten thousand eyes, [who is] great, well-procured, sleepless, [and] continuously awake ... 11 whom warriors worship on the backs of [their] horses, asking [for] vigor for [their] teams, vitality for [their] bodies, far-sightedness with respect to those whom they hate, the overcoming of the malevolent, [and] the striking down with a single blow of [their] enemies, adversaries, and those whom they hate.
Grammar
21 r- and r/n-stem Nouns
21.1 tar-stems
Avestan nouns ending in the suffix tar function either as agent nouns designating the performers of actions -- e.g., θvastar- 'fashioner' -- or as relational nouns describing familial ties -- e.g., ptar- (pitar-) 'father'. The two types are differentiated by the grade of their strong stem formations in the nominative and accusative: agent nouns show extended grade; relation nouns, full grade. All other cases form weak grade stems. Masculine and feminine decline similarly.

Voc. pl.	 	unattested	 	*pitarah
21.2 r/n-stems
Masculine nouns in ar -- e.g., nar 'man' -- decline much like relational nouns in tar, except for the stem ātar 'fire', root āt + suffix ar, with nominative singular masculine ātarš in Young Avestan and accusative singular ātr̥m alongside the more regular ātarəm. It is supposed that this form was originally a neuter. Feminines do not appear.

22 Possessive Pronouns
Possessive pronouns based on personal pronouns appear in Old Avestan with adjectivival function. They are formed in the singular by adding the suffix a to the m-, tu-, and hu-stems of the first, second, and third person pronouns, respectively, with second person tu- > θu. Plural attestations are found only in the first and second person and are built by adding āka to the stems az- and yu-. Third person and neuter forms of all genders appear rarely and in only a small number of cases. They are therefore not included here.

23 The Imperfect
Avestan includes the use of a simple preterite, or past tense called the imperfect. It is part of the present system, because it is made by adding characteristic endings to the present stem. It conveys past action and may be translated with either a simple or continuous sense, e.g., baraṯ from bar 'bear, support, carry', as 'he carried' or 'he was carrying'.

Imperfect	 	Active	 	Middle
1 sg.	 	barəm	 	baire
2 sg.	 	*barō	 	*baran̨ha
3 sg.	 	baraṯ	 	barata
 	 	 	 	 
1 du.	 	*barāva	 	unattested
3 du.	 	baratəm	 	*baraētəm, barōiδe
 	 	 	 	 
1 pl.	 	barāma, barama	 	unattested
2 pl.	 	*barata	 	*baradvəm
3 pl.	 	barən	 	*barən̨ta
24 Passive Constructions
Passive stems include finite verbal formations in both the present and aorist systems. The present passive stem is formed by adding the suffix -ya to the root in its full grade, to which a middle ending is added; e.g., baryate < bar 'it was borne'. The aorist passive occurs only in the third person singular. It is formed by adding the ending -ī to the full grade of root; e.g., mraoī < mru 'it was told'.

A past participle passive is also found in Avestan. It is formed by adding either the suffix -ta or, more rarely, -na to the root, which usually appears in its weak grade; e.g., gušta- < guš 'hear', uxta- < vak 'speak'. A small number of roots add i before the suffix, e.g. zairita- < zar 'be/make angry.

As noted in Section 14, a participle is a verbal adjective and thus has adjectival inflection. Since the past participle passive ends in a, it declines accordingly (cf. Section 3).

25 Zarathustrianism and Zoroastrianism, Gathic Avestan and Younger Avestan
As noted in the Introduction, there is a considerable difference in doctrine between the Gathas, which are exemplified in lessons 1-4, and the Yasts or hymns, such as to Mithra herein and to Haoma in lesson 6. The Gathas present the doctrines preached by Zarathustra, whose dates are disputed, though roughly from 630-553 B.C. But the texts themselves, composed in an archaic dialect of Avestan, may be much older. The Yasts and other texts are dated from the second half of the fifth century B.C. To distinguish the differences in doctrine between the two sets of texts, the terms Zarathustrianism and Zoroastrianism have been introduced. Zarathustrianism is considered to represent the teaching of the prophet; it is monotheistic, featuring dualism between Truth and Falsehood, and between the Incremental Spirit and the Fiendish Spirit. The one god, Ahura Mazda, has created seven spiritual aspects of himself -- Amesha Spentas, who are representatives of man, cattle, fire, metal, earth, water, and plants.

The later religion is mixed, reflecting the expansion of the Achaemenian Empire under Darius I, who was king of Persia from 521-486 B.C. He apparently came to know the religion when its territory was conquered by the Persians and, recognizing Ahura Mazda as their chief god, took him over. But the Persians did not mention Zarathustra, and their priests were open to allowing worshippers to pay their reverence to Mithra, Anahita and the chief gods of other cults as well as to Ahura Mazda. This mixed religion spread widely; to distinguish it from the older religion, it was given the name Zorastrianism based on the Greek version of the name.

The language of the two periods also varies in details. The Later or Younger Avestan exhibits grammatical changes such as the use of the relative particle ya- also as an article. On the whole these changes are minor, with the basic grammars being the same.
