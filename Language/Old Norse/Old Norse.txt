Vikings
Old Norse may be succinctly characterized as the "language of the vikings". Indeed the term víkingr is found in Old Norse itself; but its use in other languages (cf. Old English wicing), where it refers to the seafaring marauders who plagued their shores, typically forms the basis for the modern connotations. Beginning in the late 8th century AD, much of western Europe fell subject to periodic harassment by these ship-borne warriors from the north, and their desecration of such holy sanctuaries as Christian monasteries did much to cement the notion of ruthless, lawless savages which remains bound to the term viking.

But this is not the whole story. To be certain, the northmen who went on such raids were harsh warriors taking plunder from often defenseless peoples. They did not, however, form the entirety of the culture of Old Norse speakers. Not every speaker of Old Norse was termed a víkingr; and often when the term is applied, it has more the connotation of 'free enterpriser' than 'cutthroat pirate'. Archaeology rounds out the picture, showing that the part of Scandinavian culture not engaged in foreign raids was in places tied to the land, and more often centered on trading. Presumably it was the search for new trade routes which impelled Scandinavians to push into eastern Europe, laying the foundations for the cultures mentioned in the earliest Russian documents. Scandinavians prospered along such trade routes, the wealthiest evidently in Gotland. These Gotlanders were themselves wary of pirating, since most of the treasures unconvered by archaeologists come from hidden stashes deliberately buried by the foot of trees or near large rocks.

Of course it is the literature of Old Norse itself which finally rounds out the cultural picture. The literature is voluminous, and the lengthy sagas often mention a bold víkingr and his exploits. They tout manly virtues, extol armed combat, and laud rash and rowdy behavior. But most of these stories were written over a century after the viking raids ceased to dominate the concerns of other Europeans. Though the writing style of many sagas is matter-of-fact, it must be borne in mind that it is being written for a dispersed group of rural aristocrats sometimes more attached to political intrigue and literary pasttimes than to pillaging and plundering. It is uncertain how much of the heroic actions are to be attributed to historical fact, and how much to the romanticizing tendencies of the authors. Poetry, by contrast, does seem to date back to the period of the viking raids. And it may be telling that sagas often portray great warriors simultaneously as great poets. In fact, some of the Scandinavian poetry is more technically and metaphorically complex than anything else produced in Europe at the time.

Linguistic Heredity
The linguistic genealogy of Old Norse begins with the spread of Proto-Indo-European. Proto-Indo-European (PIE) refers to a language reconstructed by linguists and presumably extant before the advent of writing in its speaking area.  The term can likewise refer to the presumed speakers of this language: a group united by a linguistic identity, though perhaps ethnically diverse, as we see among modern languages like English and Spanish.  PIE provides the root of a linguistic family tree including, aside from Germanic, other branches such as Slavic, Celtic, Indo-Iranian, Romance, and Greek languages.  Schematically, we may imagine that a certain dialect group within the PIE speaking community began to distance itself from the remainder of the community.  This might have happened, for example, through migration, increased commerce with neighboring cultures, or an influx of speakers of non-Indo-European backgrounds. Over time this speech community became sufficiently distinct from other PIE speakers to allow for independent language evolution.  Through ensuing centuries of population influx, shifting geographic frontiers, and intermingling with neighboring cultures this dialect developed into what we may term Common Germanic or Proto-Germanic (PGmc). The same process then repeated, so that PGmc itself came to display ever more dramatic regional variation. By the late pre-Christian, early Christian era, there emerged three distinct dialects: East, West, and North Germanic. From West Germanic developed Old English and Old Frisian, as well as Old High German and Old Saxon. From North Germanic are descended the Scandinavian languages, with the oldest literature in Old Norse. East Germanic is only attested in Gothic, which has no modern descendants.

Such a tripartite division unfortunately oversimplifies the situation. There seem to be several points of convergence between branches, so that it is difficult to maintain a view of early division and subsequent isolation. For example, Old Norse and Gothic show a common innovation within the Germanic family, whereby medial jj and ww are both sharpened (to ddj and ggw in Gothic, to ggj and ggw in Old Norse). Likewise both retain -t as a marker of the second person singular past indicative. These might be considered indications of a close affinity between the East and North branches of Germanic.

On the other hand, Old Norse shares some features with West Germanic, to the exclusion of Gothic. In Old Norse and West Germanic both -dōm and -skapi are used as suffixes to produce abstract nouns, whereas they are only used as root nouns in Gothic. Old Norse and the West Germanic languages also show the pervasive traces of umlaut, which is absent in Gothic. Gothic exhibits the change of initial fl- to þl-, absent in both North and West Germanic. Reduplicated verbs are still somewhat productive in Gothic, but completely marginalized in Old Norse and West Germanic.

Thus a simplistic family-tree model resulting from presumed linguistic isolation is a tenuous and sometimes misleading synopsis of the early development of the Germanic languages. Close ties between speech communities must have survived migratory periods, and the relative uniformity of literary traditions must gloss over a more intricate web of common speech.

Origin and Geographical Location

Recent theories place the speech area of Proto-Germanic in the region of what is now Denmark and southern Sweden. Although archaeological evidence shows that the area was inhabited as far back as 10,000 BC, the Germanic presence is usually associated with the "Battle-Axe Culture", a group which invaded the region sometime in the third millenium BC. It seems that the speakers of North Germanic did not move far from this area in the earliest migration phases of the Germanic tribes. There is a general consensus that the locus of Norse speakers was still centered on this region just before their entrance into wider European historical traditions.

This is not to say that the North Germanic speakers were necessarily completely sedentary. The nature of the contact between various members of the three basic branches of Germanic in this region is not entirely clear. As seen in the discussion of linguistic heredity, though Germanic divided into three main branches, there is a complicated network of interrelations between them. If these linguistic interrelations are reflections of close contact, then the motions of the Germanic-speaking peoples in this area were constantly shifting, and sedentary lifestyles were possibly the exception and not the norm.

Matters of locale become quite a bit easier after Old Norse speakers start to migrate from the area of Denmark and Sweden, for then their exploits are recorded, either by the Norse themselves, or by other people of Europe upon whom they made an impression. Some pushed north into modern Norway, others west toward the Orkneys and Shetland Islands. Others made their way to the northern coast of France. From the island outposts it was not a far push to Iceland; then on to Greenland and as far as North America. A long period of migration established a lasting presence in the northern region of England. Ventures in the opposite direction took the Norse along rivers of eastern Europe through western Russia and into Byzantium itself.

In this vein it should be noted that Old Norse is a term not denoting a particularly uniform spoken language as such, but rather a collection of wide ranging dialects with extremely close affinities. Old Norse is a catch-all term for Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, Old Swedish, Old Danish, and Old Gotlandic, though it is often used as a synonym for Old Icelandic because the majority of documents come from this region.

Documents
The earliest documents from the Scandinavian speaking area are runic insciptions. These extend as far back as the 2nd century AD. For the most part they are inscriptions on stone, or on more personal artifacts, such as brooches or swords. The largest number of these come from Denmark and Sweden. Many of them are in a dialect much more archaic than Old Norse itself.

The preponderance of documents in Old Norse comes from Iceland. Among these literary monuments, Eddic poetry appears to represent the oldest stage. This is preserved mainly in one manuscript, which contains several poems of alliterative verse. The basic themes of the poems center either around the gods and mythic origins, or around heroes of an earlier age.

Another important genre in Old Norse was that of Skaldic poetry. This was a highly wrought form of poetry well steeped in tradition. It seems generally to have been a sort of praise poetry, meant to extol the virtues and sing the notable exploits of kings and other patrons. Many references talk of how skaldic poems were composed on the spot, all the more impressive because of the intricacy of the genre. The poetic forms were varied, yet each individual form was quite rigid. Direct statement was avoided, rather persons or things were referenced by means of ornate circumlocutions known as 'kennings'. So intricate was the style, and so long was the tradition, that Snorri Sturluson composed a monumental work dedicated to the subject. His Prose Edda contains a collection of stories which flesh out the mythic material often elliptically referenced in skaldic verse. It likewise contains a robust treatment of the mechanics of skaldic composition, together with examples of the various types of meter.

Historical investigations also occupied the literary talents of Icelanders. Foremost among these was Ari Þorgilsson, who compiled a history of the settlement of Iceland. The original version of his Íslendigabók (Book of Icelanders) is lost, but a shorter version composed later still survives.

A large body of Icelandic literature is in the form of sagas. These are prose compositions with single authors, generally intended to be read as entertainment. For the most part the sagas center around some historical figure or group, and purport to give an accurate account of events. But this notion is only a skeleton about which an ornate and richly decorated narrative art is woven. Sagas tell the stories of Norwegian kings, of the early settlers of Iceland, of Snorri's own family, and of legendary personages. Typical themes are family feuds and the quest for revenge.

Viking Expansion
Although the Scandinavians enter the records of Western Europe sometime around 790 AD, which therefore marks the beginning of the so-called 'Viking Age', these northern peoples had in fact begun a process of expansion some two or three generations before. The first waves of expansion originated in Sweden and Gotland in roughly 700, leading to colonies in modern-day Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. In grave sites near Libau (in Latvia), we find signs of a community of traders from Gotland accompanied by women. We also find signs of another community of Swedes, but here only males and accompanied solely by battle gear.

The famous attacks of almost a century later were spearheaded by the Norwegians, the most notable early attack being on Lindisfarne in 793. There the Norwegians landed and seized livestock, plundered the monastery, and killed several clergy. It was the desecration of the holy sites which set panic in the hearts of Western Europe as such raids continued in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and northern England.

Scandinavian settlement between the 8th and 11th centuries

These raids were nevertheless accompanied by true expansion in the form of colonies. The earliest Norwegian colonies were established around 800 on the Orkney and Shetland islands. Although raids were likely part of their economic input, remains from these settlements show that the inhabitants subsisted on the products of farming, fishing, and seal-hunting. Raids in Ireland increased over the ensuing decades until finally the first Scandinavian settlement was founded at Dublin in 836. Over the next few years the Norwegians strengthened their hold on this harbor under the authority of Thorgisl, whose wife gave prophecies at the altar of the monastery. There is little evidence that the Scandinavians attempted to push their settlements farther inland. They seem content to have secured a few ports, which served as launching points for expeditions to colonize the Isle of Man, Scotland, and other regions. Although most early colonization led to the expulsion of any indigenous population, the settling of the Isle of Man seems to have resulted in a blending of Scandinavian and Celtic culture, illustrated most acutely in the art. Some of the images clearly represent Norse mythology, interfused with Celtic designs and workmanship.

It was not until roughly 860-870 that the Scandinavian seafarers pushed west all the way to Iceland. The first expeditions encountered Irish hermits, but settlement did not start until sometime later. Colonization proceeded for some 60 years, at the end of which the population probably neared 20,000 inhabitatants. The process of settlement is described in Egils saga, whereby the leader of a group of settlers would lay claim to a great expanse of land and delimit the borders by beacons or boundary markers. After exploring the land for some time, they would then erect a permanent farmstead.

Scandinavia

The earliest colonizing expeditions came from Norway, where the growing population made land scarce on the mainland. But they were soon followed in large numbers by Danes and Swedes. Though the Danes were preoccupied for most of the early 9th century with raids in England and France, by roughly 870 focus turned toward colonizing the northeast portion of England. Settlements became so numerous that they occupied large portions of Mercia, Northumbria, and East Anglia. Eventually Alfred, in a treaty, officially recognized much of this as Danish territory, the so-called Danelaw. The question remains open as to whether the lion's share of the settlements was established through occupation by large Danish military forces campaigning in those regions, or by smaller forces and more attendant settlers following in their wake. Between 880 and 920 there was also large-scale settlement on the Continent, in the area of Normandy. Though the leader Rollo is said to have been Norwegian, the sources of the place-names suggest that a large number of the settlers were Danes.

In England there was peace for some 50 years, but in the 980s the Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes combined forces and proceeded to raid the English coasts. In 994 one party attacked London, but ceased when they were paid off at a sum of 16,000 pounds of silver. In 1002, Ethelred the Unready ordered the massacre of all Danes south of the Danelaw, which had the unfortunate result of inciting King Svein of Denmark to attack England. The invasion was bought off at a price of 36,000 pounds of silver. Svein returned in 1013 to conquer England, in which he succeeded as Ethelred fled to Normandy. Ethelred regained control when Svein died the following year, but Svein's son Cnut wrested control from Ethelred and became ruler of England at the tender age of 20.

At roughly the same time, the Scandinavians made their final push westward. The Icelander Erik the Red rediscovered Greenland in 982, and colonization began a few years later. In time the two main settlements grew to an estimated 3,000 inhabitants. Some homes still survive which were made of turf or stone, as well as a chapel erected in 1001 by Erik's wife. Farming consisted primarily of tending cattle, sheep and goats, but there is some evidence of less than successful attempts to grow grain. The inevitable finding of America may have come at first by accident, discovered by a certain Bjarni in 986. He apparently drifted off his course for Greenland in a fog and sighted an unfamiliar land several times before heading northeast and finally reaching Greenland. Years later, in 1003, Erik's son Leif the Lucky decided to investigate Bjarni's reports further and made his way to the newly dubbed Vinland.

Author Introduction
Ari Þorgilsson (1067-1148) was a meticulous historical researcher whose works laid the foundations for many of the later sagas. He was preoccupied with correctly establishing dates, sifting through evidence and often quoting his sources. The reliability of his research methods is almost unrivalled among later saga writers. His life and works are described in the preface of Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. From what information can be gathered concerning Ari, it seems he authored Íslendingabók, a work now lost. This contained lives of kings and genealogies. He also authored another work, the Libellus Islandorum, which is also called Íslendingabók. It gives a brief history of the settlement of Iceland. A comment in Landnámabók suggests that he may have assisted in the compilation of this work as well, but it is likely that the contents are merely based on the information of Ari's own works.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage comes from the Libellus Islandorum. The beginning relates the conditions that led to the work's composition, and its relation to the earlier Íslendingabók. It continues with the first settlement of Iceland in the year 870 AD. The prose style is simple and straightforward, without the literary polish of many later saga writers. Ari is quick to establish the authority of his sources, breaking off in the middle of a sentence to do so at some length. He is also quick to establish dates, anchoring events to the year of a king's reign.

En með því at þeim líkaði svá at hafa eða þar viðr auka, þá skrifaða ek þessa of it sama far, fyr útan Ættar-tǫlu ok Konunga-ævi. Ok jók ek því er mér varð síðan kunnara, ok nú er gørr sagt á þessi en á þeirri. En hvatki er missagt er í frœðum þessum, þá er skylt at hafa þat heldr er sannara reynisk.

Ísland bygðisk fyrst ór Norvegi á dǫgum Haralds ins Hárfagra, Hálfdanarsonar ins Svarta, í þann tíð -- at ætlun ok tǫlu þeira Teits fóstra mins, þess manns er ek kunna spakastan, sonar Ísleifs biskups ; ok Þorkels fǫðurbróður mins, Gellissonar, er langt mundi fram; ok Þóríðar Snorradóttur Goða, er bæði var margspǫk ok ólúgfróð -- er Ívarr, Ragnarsson Loðbrókar, lét drepa Eadmund inn Helga Englakonung. En þat var dccclxx vetra eptir burð Krists, at því er ritit er í sǫgu hans.

Ingólfr hét maðr Norrœnn, er sannliga er sagt at fœri fyrst þaðan til Íslands, þá er Haraldr inn Hárfagri var xvj vetra gamall, en í annat sinn fám vetrum síðar. Hann bygði suðr í Reykjarvík. Þar er Ingólfshǫfði kallaðr, fyr austan Minþakseyri, sem hann kom fyrst á land ; en þar Ingólfsfell fyr vestan Ǫlfossá, er hann lagði sína eigu á síðan. Í þann tíð var Ísland viði vaxit í miðli fjals ok fjǫru.

Þá váru hér menn Kristnir þeir er Norðmenn kalla papa. En þeir fóru síðan á braut, af því at þeir vildu eigi vera hér við heiðna menn, ok létu eptir bœkr Írskar ok bjǫllur ok bagla : at því mátti skilja at þeir váru menn Írskir.

Translation
I composed the Book of Icelanders first for our bishops Thorlak and Ketil, and I showed it both to them and to the priest Saemund. But as it pleased them to have it so or for it to be augmented, I have written this one concerning the same topic, without the Genealogy and the Kings' Lives. I have added what later became more clear to me, and it now deals more fully with this or that story. And whatever is misstated in these histories, it should later be necessary to have that instead which should prove more correct.
On the Settlement of Iceland
Iceland was settled first from Norway in the days of Harald the Fair-Haired, son of Halfdan the Black, at that time -- according to the opinion and reckoning of my foster-brother Teit, a man I regard as very learned, son of the bishop Isleif; and of my uncle Thorkel, son of Gellir, who could remember a long time back; and of Thorith, daughter of Snorri the Chief, who was both greatly wise and steeped in tradition -- when Ivar, son of Shaggy-Breeches Ragnar, ordered Saint Edmund, king of the Angles, to be killed. And that was 870 years after the birth of Christ, as it is written in his story.
The Norwegian man was called Ingolf, who it's said had actually first travelled from there to Iceland, when Harald the Fair-Haired was 16 years old; and then on another journey a few years later. He settled south in Reykjavik. The place is called Ingolf's Head, east of Minthak's Shoal, where he first came to land; and Ingolf's Fell west of Ale-Force River, which he afterwards took possession of. At that time Iceland was covered with forest between mountain and beach.
There were Christian men in this place, whom the Norwegians called "papas". But they later went on their way, since they did not want to stay here with heathen men, and they left behind their Irish books and bells and croziers: in this way they were able to determine that they were Irish men.
There was a very extensive migration of people out to here from Norway, up to the point when king Harald banned it, since it seemed to him to amount to a depopulation. Then they settled on this, that each man should pay the king five ounces of silver, and he should not be exempt from this, whosoever would journey here from there. And so it is said that Harald was king 70 years, and reached eighty years old. These have become the basis for the tax which is now called land-dues. Sometimes more were paid, sometimes less, until Olaf the Thick made definite that each man should pay the king a half mark, whoever would travel between Norway and Iceland, except women or those men whom he should exempt. So Thorkel, son of Gellir, told us.

1 The Alphabet
The earliest records of the Old Norse (ON) language are found in runic inscriptions. A literary language began to emerge around 1100 AD, whose manuscripts are written in an alphabet adopted from the English literary tradition. The letters of the Old Norse alphabet are given below, along with a rough guide to their pronunciation in the "classical period", ca. 1150-1350 AD. The numbers indicate that several consonants had differing pronunciations depending on their phonetic environment. These differences are indicated in the last column.

Doubled consonants, e.g. kk or nn, were held twice as long as their corresponding individual counterparts. This is similar to the contrast in Modern English between n in 'run away' and in 'run now'; in the second instance the n is held longer than in the first. Similarly the k-sound in 'book end', compared with 'book case'. Likewise, if a short vowel is thought to occupy one musical beat, then a long vowel occupies nearly two musical beats. The difference between long and short vowels, at least in the era leading up to the classical period, was one of quantity and not quality.

The letters q and w are encountered chiefly in texts of East Norse. They are generally treated as equivalent to k and v respectively.

The letter ǫ́, representing a long back rounded vowel, does not actually appear in ON texts of the classical period. It seems to have existed in an earlier stage of the language, and some editors use the symbol.

There were also three diphthongs. They are listed below, along with their pronunciation.

Diphthong	 	Pronunciation
 	 	 
au	 	ow as in 'now'
ei	 	ay as in 'hay'
ey	 	combination of ON e+y
By far the most extensive literature written in Old Norse comes from Iceland. For this reason is it quite common to refer to Old Norse as Old Icelandic. Moreover, the grammar and orthography have changed relatively little in the intervening centuries between the documents of Old Icelandic and Modern Icelandic. It is therefore customary to pronounce ON documents according to Modern Icelandic pronunciation. Below is a rough guide to the modern pronunciation.

ú	 	oo as in 'droop'	 	 
u	 	(1) oo as in 'droop'	 	immediately preceding ng
 	 	(2) wee as in 'sweet'	 	immediately preceding gi
 	 	(3) u as in 'cute'	 	otherwise
v	 	v as in 'very'	 	 
w	 	(see v above)	 	 
x	 	chs as in Scots 'lochs'	 	 
ý	 	ee as in 'feet'	 	 
y	 	i as in 'pit'	 	 
z	 	s as in 'this'	 	 
þ	 	th as in 'thin'	 	 
æ	 	y as in 'my'	 	 
ǫ́	 	eu as in French 'peur'	 	 
ǫ	 	(1) eu as in French 'peur'	 	all environments other than (2), below
 	 	(2) oei as in French 'oeil'	 	immediately preceding ng or gi
ø	 	eu as in French 'peur'	 	 
œ	 	y as in 'my'	 	 
Since c, q, and w only appear in manuscripts with distinctly regional characteristics in the classical period, they have no "modern" pronunciation as such.

Doubled consonants, as in the classical pronunciation, are usually held longer than their individual counterparts. The doubled consonants kk, pp, tt are pre-aspirated in Modern Icelandic. This means that the same puff of air which follows p in American English 'pot' actually precedes kk, pp, or tt in the modern pronunciation. The consonants k, p, and t are also preaspirated when they immediately precede l, m, or n. The double consonant ll has a peculiar pronunciation. Many speakers articulate this as the cluster tl, but where the l is unvoiced. Thus there is a dental or alveolar tap followed by lateral expulsion of air around the tongue, but without any of the vocal chord vibration an English speaker normally associates with l. When consonant clusters exceed two, alteration or deletion may occur, so that, e.g., rigndi is pronounced more like "rindi", barns more like "bass".

The diphthongs too are pronounced differently from their presumed classical values. Their pronunciations are listed below.

Diphthong	 	Pronunciation
 	 	 
au	 	oei as in French 'oeil'
ei	 	ay as in 'hay'
ey	 	ay as in 'hay'
After the classical period, Icelandic developed an epenthetic vowel, u, which appeared between a consonant (not r) and r. It is most commonly found before such an r in final position. Thus classical maðr is represented by modern maður, classical bindr by modern bindur.

2 Sound System
The sections below discuss the sound system of Old Norse in the classical period, to the extent that it can be reconstructed. This should not be confused with the sound system of Modern Icelandic, which differs from that of Old Norse in several respects.

2.1 Consonants
The sounds of ON may be characterized according to their manner of articulation. The following chart represents the articulation of consonants.

 	 	 	 	Labial	 	(Alveo-)Dental	 	Velar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stops	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Voiceless:	 	p	 	t	 	k
 	 	Voiced:	 	b	 	d	 	g
Continuants	 	 	 	f	 	þ	 	h
Sibilant	 	 	 	 	 	s	 	 
Nasals	 	 	 	m	 	n	 	 
Liquids	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	Continuant:	 	 	 	l	 	 
 	 	Trilled:	 	 	 	r	 	 
The above, of course, is an idealization, since Section 1 makes quite clear that the phonemes of ON and the letters are by no means in one-to-one correspondence. The chart places the letters of ON in the position of their most common phonetic value. For example, the position of f in the chart above corresponds only to pronunciation (1) in the preceding section. Likewise, the placement of p in the chart follows from its own pronunciation (1), since its pronunciation (2) is already represented by f. The letter ð is not phonemically (although it is phonetically) distinct from þ and is therefore not included explicitly in the chart. Note also that z is orthographic shorthand for t+s or ð+s, and x for k+s.

2.2 Vowels
The chart below similarly organizes the vowels of ON by their manner of articulation. In each pair, the first member is the short vowel, the second the corresponding long vowel.

 	 	Front	 	 	 	Back	 	 
 	 	Unrounded	 	Rounded	 	Unrounded	 	Rounded
High	 	i, í	 	y, ý	 	 	 	u
Mid	 	e, é	 	ø, œ	 	 	 	o, ó
Low	 	-, æ	 	 	 	a, á	 	ǫ, (ǫ́)
The basic vowels a, e, i, o, u all have long variants. The other vowels are derived from these by either i-umlaut or u-umlaut depending on phonetic environment. This led to the asymmetric system shown above.

There were also two semivowels in ON, v and j (v seems originally to have been a semivowel, only later taking on the characteristics of a bilabial fricative). They could not carry the peak of sonority in a syllable, but they could effect umlaut in the vowel of a preceding syllable.

2.3 Syllables and Stress
There are various monosyllabic words in ON, such as á, til, at. In polysyllabic words, when they are not compounds of more than one word, it is customary to divide syllables before a vowel, e.g. far-a, kall-a, gǫrð-um, gam-all-a, hundr-að-a. In compound words, syllable division occurs at the boundary of the compounded elements, e.g. vápn-lauss, vík-ing-a-hǫfð-ing-i (< víkinga + hǫfðingi). Syllable length is an important factor in the operation of many phonological rules, and within this scheme there are the following types of syllables:

 	 	Type	 	Description	 	Examples
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1	 	Short	 	(short vowel) + (short consonant)	 	bað
2	 	Long	 	(short vowel) + (consonant group)	 	rann, ǫnd
3	 	Long	 	(long vowel) + (short/no consonant)	 	hús, fé, gnúa
4	 	Overlong	 	(long vowel) + (consonant group)	 	nótt, blástr
Though it is traditional, a few important grammars of ON do not follow the above method of syllable division and long/short classification. Alternatively, syllables are divided so that non-initial syllables begin with a consonant, e.g. fa-ra, kal-la, gǫr-ðum, ga-mal-la, hund-ra-ða. (This agrees with syllable division in the classical languages, Latin and Greek.) In this scheme, the long/short distinction follows the principle:

 	 	a short syllable is one that
 	 	ends in a short vowel or
 	 	ends in a long vowel followed by a weakly-stressed short vowel.
For example, the initial syllables of geta, konungr, búa, róa are short. All other syllables are thus long. The fact that a long vowel such as ú is shortened before the following short vowel parallels the shortening of the o of do in a phrase like 'do it!' (This is not the same as in Latin and Greek.) Under the traditional length scheme, grammatical and metrical length differ. Thus bað, under the first scheme, is a grammatically short syllable. In poetry, however, this syllable may be counted as metrically long. The second scheme does in fact count this syllable as long. (The situation is complicated by the fact that different types of poetry employ different rules for determining vowel length.)

Weakly stressed syllables may only contain the short vowels a, i, u. Short vowels may not immediately precede short vowels within a word-form; in situations where this would arise through morphological changes, the first vowel is dropped. For example, lifi- plus the ending -r yields lifir, but with the ending -um gives lifum.

Primary stress falls on the first syllable of a word stem. In compounds of two words, primary stress falls on the first syllable of the first word stem, and secondary stress is given to the first syllable of the second word stem. In triple compounds, the first word receives primary stress, the last word secondary stress, and the middle word tertiary stress, all in accordance with the above-mentioned placement of stress on the word stem. In the following examples, ' precedes the syllable with primary stress, '' the syllable with secondary stress, ''' the syllable with tertiary stress:

Simplex	 	Duplex	 	Triplex
 	 	 	 	 
'út out	 	 	 	 
'ganga course	 	'út-''ganga exit	 	 
'dyrr door	 	 	 	'út-'''gǫngu-''dyrr exit door
 	 	 	 	 
'land land	 	 	 	 
'nám seizure	 	'land-''nám land-settlement	 	 
'maðr man	 	 	 	'land-'''náms-''maðr settler
2.4 Umlaut
The process of umlaut, or mutation, is pervasive in ON morphological paradigms. Umlaut refers to what might otherwise be called vocalic assimilation. Specifically, the articulation of a vowel in a given syllable may be changed by the speaker's anticipation of the vowel in the following syllable. Because of this anticipation, the articulation of the following vowel colors the articulation of the given vowel, producing in essence a new vowel with features of both. In ON, i and u most commonly trigger such changes in a preceding vowel, a process called i- and u-umlaut, respectively.

Although pervasive, i- and u-umlaut are no longer productive in ON. The learner of ON must view the process as having already occurred and stopped by the time of the ON texts. Not every i or u in a syllable will cause umlaut in the preceding vowel. Rather the results of i- and u-umlaut have been regularized and should be viewed as yielding vocalic alternations which are frozen within verbal and nominal paradigms. Beyond those vocalic alternations found in paradigms, no other umlaut functions (regularly) in the ON texts. Often the i or u which caused umlaut in a given form will have subsequently been lost, so that the reason for umlaut within a given paradigm may not be apparent on the surface.

In i-umlaut, or front mutation, a following i or j causes a preceding primary stressed vowel to be fronted, while the vowel's roundness remains unaffected. This produces the following correspondences.

 	 	Underlying Vowel	 	Result of i-umlaut
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	a	 	e
 	 	á	 	æ
 	 	o	 	ø
 	 	ó	 	œ
 	 	u	 	y
 	 	ú	 	ý
Examples of where this process does not occur are the following: the i in case endings of masculine and neuter nouns; the thematic i of noun declensions; the thematic i of certain weak verbs. At the time i-umlaut was productive in ON, these vowels were e, and the shift e > i occurred after i-umlaut stopped being an automatic process.

In u-umlaut, or back mutation, a following u or v causes a preceding primary stressed vowel to be rounded, while its backness/frontness remains unaffected. This produces the following correspondences.

 	 	Underlying Vowel	 	Result of u-umlaut
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	a	 	ǫ
 	 	á	 	(ǫ́) > á
 	 	e	 	ø
 	 	é	 	œ
 	 	i	 	y
 	 	í	 	ý
 	 	 	 	 
 	 	unstressed a	 	u
Presumably u-umlaut caused the mutation of the long á to a long back rounded vowel ǫ́, but this seems to have merged with á at an early stage and is not found in texts of the classical period. The u-umlaut of long and short i and e is marginal compared to the u-umlaut of a. Remember that only a, i, u may occur in unstressed syllables, and of these, a shifts to u in the process of u-umlaut.

The sounds o and y also alternate in ON. Originally, u and y alternated as a result of i-umlaut. In certain environments no longer systematic in ON, u lowered to o and left an alternation between o and y.

2.5 Consonant Changes
Consonant changes regularly occurred under several specific circumstances. The most notable of these are given below.

Gemination

The sounds -t or -r geminated (doubled) when attached to a stem ending in a long stressed vowel, e.g. ný- + -t > nýtt; fá- + -ri > fárri.

Simplification

A double consonant is simplified when preceded by another consonant, e.g. akr- + -r > akrr > akr; fagr- + -rar > fagrrar > fagrar; jarl- + -r > jarll (see assimilation, below) > jarl.

Assimilation

The were five important situations for consonant assimilation:

-r assimilates to preceding l, s, or n in a long syllable, e.g. sæl- + -r > sæll; væn- + -r > vænn; fús- + -r > fúss.
-ð- assimilates to preceding ð-, yielding -dd-, e.g. eyða 'lay waste' > eyddi (past 3rd sing.). -ð- assimilates to preceding -t- or -s- (and sometimes -k-), yielding -tt-, -st- (-kt-), e.g. setja 'to set' > setti (past 3rd sing.); kyssa 'to kiss' > kyssti; kneikja 'to bend back' > kneikti; but merkja 'to mark' > merkði, rekkja 'to go to bed' > rekkði.
-ð- or -d- assimilate to following -t, yielding -tt, e.g. kald- + -t > kaltt > kalt; harð- + -t > hartt > hart.
-nn- occasionally becomes -ð before -r, e.g. mann- + -r > maðr; ann(a)r- + -ar > aðrar; but munnr remains unchanged.
-k- + -ð- sometimes yields -tt-, e.g. sœkja 'to seek' > sótti (past 3rd sing.); þykkja 'to seem' > þótti; but compare the second rule above.
Devoicing

A final consonant cluster is devoiced, and assimilated, in the second principal part of certain Class III and Class VII strong verbs: -nd > -tt; -ng > -kk; -ld > -lt. For example, binda 'to bind' > batt (past 3rd sing.); stinga 'to sting' > stakk; gjalda 'to pay' > galt; ganga 'to go' > gekk; halda 'to hold' > helt.

Consonant Loss

An -n- or -l- occasionally drops before final -t in an unstressed short syllable, e.g. mikil- + -t > mikit; búin- + -t > búit; but gamal- + -t > gamalt.

3 Strong Declension
There are three grammatical genders in ON -- masculine, feminine, neuter. These have no bearing on sexual gender, but when the referent has a distinct sexual gender, the noun representing it typically has the grammatical gender of the same name (but not always). The gender of compound nouns was that of the final element. There are two numbers, singular (one of a thing) and plural (more than one of a thing), except for the personal pronouns, which also display forms for the dual (two of a thing). There are four nominal cases -- Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, Dative. A noun in the nominative case acts as the grammatical subject of its clause, or specifies something predicated to the subject. A noun in the accusative acts as a direct object, or displays the terminus of directed motion, be the motion spatial or temporal (e.g. 'for several miles' or 'for several days' could be expressed by accusative forms, without the need for prepositions). A noun in the genitive marks a general sphere of relation; this relation could be so specific that it connotes possession ('John's book'), but it might be more general ('a day's journey'). A noun in the dative denotes the indirect object of its clause, or more generally a party interested in the action. Grammatical cases inherently connote what in English would usually require a preposition, so that prepositions are not strictly necessary. But to elicit certain nuances, prepositions are commonly used in ON.

All nouns in ON decline according to strong or weak declensions. This is a property of the noun; a noun declines according to one or the other, not both. The declension must be learned for each noun. The terms 'strong' and 'weak' are historically due to J. Grimm; the terminology is no longer deemed insightful and no import should be read into the names. One might just as easily use 'first' and 'second' for the declensions, but inertia keeps the traditional nomenclature in place. The nominative singular of most strong nouns ends in a consonant; the nominative singular of all weak nouns ends in a vowel. The designations of the declensions follow the thematic vowel of the noun stem, which usually shows itself in ON in the accusative plural of strong masculine nouns. The nominative and accusative forms of neuter nouns are always identical.

3.1 a / ja / wa-Stems
The a / ja / wa-stem nouns are generally masculine or neuter. The endings are as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-r	 	-
A	 	-	 	-
G	 	-s, -r	 	-s
D	 	-i	 	-i
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	(thematic) + -r	 	(u-umlaut)
A	 	(thematic) + -	 	(u-umlaut)
G	 	-a	 	-a
D	 	-um	 	-um
 	 	 	 	 
There is no ending in the masculine accusative, singular and plural. The thematic vowel shows itself in the masculine plural nominative and accusative. There is no ending for the neuter nominative and accusative, both singular and plural. The historical presence of u in the neuter nominative and accusative plural causes the vowel of the last stem syllable to undergo u-umlaut; the u itself, however, was subsequently dropped and does not occur in texts of the classical period.

The masculine nouns harmr 'sorrow' and himinn 'heaven', and the neuter nouns barn 'child' and kné 'knee', illustrate the a-stem declension.

 	 	Masculine	 	 	 	Neuter

N Sg.	 	harmr	 	himinn	 	barn	 	kné
A	 	harm	 	himin	 	barn	 	kné

G	 	harma	 	himna	 	barna	 	knjá
D	 	hǫrmum	 	himnum	 	bǫrnum	 	knjám, knjóm
Note the u of the dative plural ending causes u-umlaut of the preceding vowel, as one would expect. The u causing umlaut in the neuter nominative and accusative plural, however, no longer remains. Note also the appearance of a glide j within the paradigm of kné.

Disyllabic nouns generally declined like himinn. The vowel of the last stem syllable dropped before endings beginning with a vowel, or before the thematic vowel itself. The common name Gunnar, D sg. Gunnari, is a notable exception. Some words, such as ketill and lykill, whose first vowel is a result of umlaut brought on by the second syllable, revert to the non-umlauted vowel in syncopated forms, e.g. D sg. katli and lukli.

The masculine nouns niðr 'kinsman' and hirðir 'herdsman', and the neuter nouns ríki 'kingdom', kyn 'kin' and kvæði 'poem', illustrate the ja-stem declension.

D	 	niðjum	 	hirðum	 	ríkjum	 	kynjum	 	kvæðum
The nouns niðr and kyn illustrate the declension of so-called short stems; the rest illustrate long stems.

The masculine nouns sǫngr 'song' and sær 'sea', and the neuter noun hǫgg 'strike', illustrate the wa-stem declension.

 	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	sǫngv-a-	 	sæv-a-	 	 	 	hǫggv-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sǫngr	 	sær	 	sjór	 	hǫgg
A	 	sǫng	 	sæ	 	sjó	 	hǫgg
G	 	sǫngs	 	sævar	 	sjóvar	 	hǫggs

D	 	sǫngum	 	sæ(v)um	 	sjóvum	 	hǫggum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The w (v in the orthography) of the stem remained only when it followed a short syllable, a g, or a k, and preceded a or u.

3.2 ō / jō / wō-Stems
The ō / jō / wō-stem nouns are feminine. The stems are so-named for historical reasons; the stem vowel does not appear as ō by the time ON is written down. The declensional endings are as follows.

 	 	Feminine
 	 	 
N Sg.	 	(u-umlaut), -r
A	 	(-u), -
G	 	-ar
D	 	(-u), -
 	 	 
N Pl.	 	(thematic) + -r
A	 	(thematic) + -r
G	 	-a
D	 	-um
The vowel of the final stem syllable undergoes u-umlaut in the N sg. The nominative ending -r appears only on long jō-stem nouns. The A D sg. ending -u is optional; it generally does not occur with monosyllabic stems. The A D sg. are subject to u-umlaut, even if the u-ending does not appear.

The feminine nouns grǫf 'hole', fjǫðr 'feather', á 'river', and Ingibjǫrg 'Ingeborg' illustrate the ō-stem declension.

 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	graf-a-	 	fjaðr-a-	 	á-a-	 	Ingibjarg-a-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	grǫf	 	fjǫðr	 	á	 	Ingibjǫrg
A	 	grǫf	 	fjǫðr	 	á	 	Ingibjǫrgu
G	 	grafar	 	fjaðrar	 	ár	 	Ingibjargar
D	 	grǫf	 	fjǫðr	 	á	 	Ingibjǫrgu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	grafar	 	fjaðrar	 	ár	 	 
A	 	grafar	 	fjaðrar	 	ár	 	 
G	 	grafa	 	fjaðra	 	á	 	 
D	 	grǫfum	 	fjǫðrum	 	ám	 	 
Note that the r in the N sg. of fjǫðr is part of the stem, not the alternate N sg. ending. Also note the appearance of the -u ending in the A D sg. of Ingibjǫrg. Though the -u ending does not always appear in the A D sg. of o-stem nouns, u-umlaut still occurs.

The feminine short stem nouns ben 'wound' and ey 'island', and the long stem heiðr 'heath', illustrate the jō-stem declension.

 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 
 	 	Short	 	Long	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	benj-a-	 	eyj-a-	 	heiðj-a-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ben	 	ey	 	heiðr
A	 	ben	 	ey	 	heiði
G	 	benjar	 	eyjar	 	heiðar
D	 	ben	 	eyju	 	heiði
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	benjar	 	eyjar	 	heiðar
A	 	benjar	 	eyjar	 	heiðar
G	 	benja	 	eyja	 	heiða
D	 	benjum	 	eyjum	 	heiðum
Note the ending -r in the N sg. of the long stem nouns. The differences between ō / jō-stems parallel those between a / ja-stems.

The feminine noun ǫr 'arrow' illustrates the wō-stem declension.

 	 	Feminine
 	 	 
Stem	 	ǫrv-a-
 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ǫr
A	 	ǫr
G	 	ǫrvar
D	 	ǫr(u)
 	 	 
N Pl.	 	ǫrvar
A	 	ǫrvar
G	 	ǫrva
D	 	ǫrum
4 Strong Conjugation
As with nouns, there were two types of verbs, strong and weak. These labels bear no relation to the same terms applied to nouns. Again the terminology could just as well be replaced with 'Type I' and 'Type II', since the adjectives 'strong' and 'weak' have no real connotation.

There were two tenses in ON, present and past; and three moods, indicative, subjunctive, and imperative. The tenses might more properly be termed past and non-past, inasmuch as the present forms filled the role of both present and future. Compare Modern English 'I am going to the store later', where the present tense has future meaning, equivalent to 'will go'. Likewise, the past forms in ON may have the connotation of several different tenses in Modern English, such as the simple past 'did', perfect 'has done', and pluperfect 'had done'. The latter may be expressed, as in English, by periphrastic constructions. The moods were built off of either the past or present stems, except for the imperative, which only employed the present stem. Generally the past subjunctive forms denoted potential completed actions, whereas the present subjunctive would have no such implication of completion. This parallels somewhat Modern English 'might have done' vs. 'might do'. Sometimes there seems to be little distinction between the two.

4.1 Strong Verb Classes
Strong verbs were characterized by ablaut, or vowel gradation. This process still survives in Modern English, cf. sing-sang-sung-song. Ablaut refers to the meaning- or function-specific alternation of vowels within a single verb's system. As in the example above, the s-ng base gives present verb forms with insertion of i, past verb forms with a, a past participle with u, and a derived noun with o. Not every verb which employs ablaut employs the same ablaut; take for example hang-hung-hung, where present forms are built from the a-form, past from the u-form, past participle from the u-form, and no extant noun derived through ablaut.

There are seven classes of strong verbs, based for the most part on the sequence of vowels in an ablaut system. To illustrate the possible vowel changes within a system, a selection of principal parts of verbs is made. For the study of ON, the usual choice is infinitive, present indicative (pres. 3rd sg.), past indicative (past 3rd. sg.), past indicative (past 3rd pl.), past subjunctive (past subj. 3rd. sg.), past participle. This gives six principal parts in all, from which the remaining forms of the verb may be derived. Note that the past indicative is built from two stems, one employed in the singular, the other in the plural. The principal parts used are certainly not universal, and some grammars make do with fewer; any slack is compensated for by an increased number of phonological rules.

The verbs bíta 'bite', skjóta 'shoot', bresta 'burst', bera 'bear', reka 'drive', and fara 'go' illustrate the principal parts of the first six strong verb classes. Optional principal parts are in parentheses.

Class	 	Infinitive	 	(3 Sg. Pres.)	 	3 Sg. Past	 	3 Pl. Past	 	(3 Sg. Past Subj.)	 	Past Ptcple
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	bíta 'bite'	 	bítr	 	beit	 	bitu	 	biti	 	bitinn
II	 	skjóta 'shoot'	 	skýtr	 	skaut	 	skutu	 	skyti	 	skotinn
III	 	bresta 'burst'	 	brestr	 	brast	 	brustu	 	brysti	 	brostinn
IV	 	bera 'bear'	 	berr	 	bar	 	báru	 	bæri	 	borinn
V	 	reka 'drive'	 	rekr	 	rak	 	ráku	 	ræki	 	rekinn
VI	 	fara 'go'	 	ferr	 	fór	 	fóru	 	fœri	 	farinn
For the seventh class, it is convenient to quote additional principal parts: 3rd pl. pres. indic., 3rd sg. pres. subj.. These principal parts are listed in brackets. The seventh class historically comprised reduplicated verbs. The verbs róa 'row' and snúa 'turn' illustrate the seventh class.

Class	 	Infinitive	 	(3 Sg. Pres.)	 	[3 Pl. Pres.]	 	[3 Sg. Pr. Subj.]	 	3 Sg. Past	 	3 Pl. Past	 	(3 Sg. Pa. Subj.)	 	Pa. Ptcple
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
VII	 	róa 'row'	 	rœr	 	róa	 	rói	 	reri / røri	 	røru / reru	 	reri / røri	 	róit
 	 	snúa 'turn'	 	snýr	 	snúa	 	snúi	 	sneri / snøri	 	snøru / sneru	 	sneri / snøri	 	snúit
A few common verbs are idiosyncratic enough to warrant special mention. Though not reduplicated, some grammars place these verbs in the seventh class. Their ablaut series do not fit conveniently into the above classes, and so they are listed below.

Class	 	Infinitive	 	(3 Sg. Pres.)	 	3 Sg. Past	 	3 Pl. Past	 	(3 Sg. Past Subj.)	 	Past Ptcple
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
(VII)	 	falla 'fall'	 	fellr	 	fell	 	fellu	 	felli	 	fallin
 	 	gráta 'cry'	 	grætr	 	grét	 	grétu	 	gréti	 	grátinn
 	 	hlaupa 'leap'	 	hleypr	 	hljóp	 	hljópu	 	hlýpi	 	hlaupinn
 	 	leika 'play'	 	leikr	 	lék	 	léku	 	léki	 	leikinn
4.2 Active Paradigm
The active endings of the strong verb paradigms are as follows.

Strong Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-	 	-a	 	 
2	 	-r	 	-ir	 	-
3	 	-r	 	-i

2	 	-ið	 	-ið	 	-ið
3	 	-a	 	-i	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-	 	-a	 	 
2	 	-t	 	-ir	 	 
3	 	-	 	-i	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-um	 	-im	 	 
2	 	-uð	 	-ið	 	 
3	 	-u	 	-i	 	 
The mark "-" represents a form whose ending is zero; a blank space represents the complete absence of any such form.

The conjugation of the second class verb rjúfa 'break' illustrates the endings.

Strong Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	rýf	 	rjúfa	 	 
2	 	rýfr	 	rjúfir	 	rjúf
3	 	rýfr	 	rjúfi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	rjúfum	 	rjúfim	 	rjúfum
2	 	rjúfið	 	rjúið	 	rjúfið
3	 	rjúfa	 	rjúfi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	rauf	 	ryfa	 	 
2	 	rauft	 	ryfir	 	 
3	 	rauf	 	ryfi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	rufum	 	ryfim	 	 
2	 	rufuð	 	ryfið	 	 
3	 	rufu	 	ryfi	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infinitive	 	rjúfa	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	rjúfandi	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	rofinn	 	 	 	 
These forms are derivable from a minimal set of four principal parts, namely the principal parts not in parentheses in the chart of the preceding section. Specifically, these are the following principal parts:

infinitive: rjúfa;
3 (or 1) sg. past indic.: rauf;
3 (or 1) pl. past indic.: rufu (rufum);
past participle: rofinn (neuter sg. rofit).
The procedure for arriving at the verb forms is this:

present indic. sg. forms: take the infinitive stem rjúf-, apply the rule pres. sg. indic. forms of strong verbs with back vowels undergo front mutation, add endings.
present indic. pl. / pres. subjunct. (all): take infinitive stem rjúf-, add endings.
past indic. sg.: take second principal part rauf, add endings.
past indic. pl.: take stem of third principal part ruf-, add endings.
past subjunct. (all): take stem of third principal part ruf-, apply rule past subjunct. forms of strong verbs with back vowels undergo front mutation, add endings.
imperative (all): take infinitive stem rjúf-, add endings.
present participle: take infinitive stem rjúf-, add endings.
past participle: take fourth principal part stem rof-, add endings.
Note however that a non-back vowel in a given principal part may undergo back mutation before the ending -um. Labelling the principal part stems as (1), (2), (3), (4), this gives the following schematic representation.

4.3 Middle Paradigm
The concept of voice deals with the manner in which agent and patient play a role in a given statement. The agent is the logical performer of an action; the patient is the logical recipient, or object, of an action. The agent may or may not be the grammatical subject of its clause, and likewise the patient may or may not be the direct object of its clause. A statement is active when the agent is also the grammatical subject; in this situation, if the patient is expressed, it is the direct object. An example is 'the dog bites the man'. The dog is the logical performer of the action, the agent, and is also the grammatical subject of the verb 'bites'. The statement is therefore active; the patient, 'the man', is the direct object. A statement is passive when the the patient is the grammatical subject. We may recast the same sentiment as before in the fashion 'the man is bitten by the dog'. Again the logical performer of the action is 'the dog' -- this remains the agent. It is no longer, however, the grammatical subject; rather the patient, 'the man', is the grammatical subject of the verb 'is bitten', making this a passive statement.

The middle voice, as its name would imply, occupies a position somewhere between active and passive, and is typically less precisely defined. The middle voice is used for expressing actions which have some sort of effect back on the subject, either by simple reflexive action ('I washed myself'), by personal benefit ('I had a sacrifice performed'), by internal process ('I called to mind what he said'), or a number of other nuances. In ON, the sense of the middle voice often overlaps with the passive.

The endings of the middle voice are given below. For the most part they are simply the active endings with a post-posed -sk (-mk in the 1st pers. sg.), and attendant sound changes.

Past Ptc.	 	(4) + -izk	 	 	 	 
The present participle middle is declined like the active, with -sk added after the declensional endings. The past participle is formed analogously, but is only found in the neuter.

5 Word Order and Concord
The basic word order of a declarative statement in ON was

 	 	Subject + Verb (+ Adverb) (+ Object),
where Subject and Object may stand for nouns and attendant modifiers, or even whole clauses; Adverb may stand for a single element or adverbial phrase; and Verb stands for a finite verb form. For example, Bǫðvarr gengr nú til þess rúms 'Bothvar goes now to the place...' When the Adverb comes first, it is usually followed by the Verb and Subject,

 	 	Adverb + Verb + Subject (+ Object),
e.g. Nú kømr jóla-aptann 'Now comes Christmas Eve'. Word order is fluid enough that VSO and OVS word orders are chosen when particular emphasis or stylistic variation is desired. When two clauses are joined, the normal word order is followed in each clause. The common conjunction ok 'and', however, is always followed by the verb of the second clause. Thus,

 	 	S + V (+ Adv) (+ O) + ok + V + S (+ O).
For example, hann lætr Hǫtt fara með sér, ok gørir hann þat nauðugr ok kallaði hann sér stýrt til bana 'He commanded Hott to go with him; and he did so unwillingly, and said it would be his death.' The word order of dependent clauses is the same as that for simple declarative main clauses:

 	 	Relative (+ Subject) + Verb (+ Adverb) (+ Object), or
 	 	Relative (+ Adverb) + Verb (+ Subject) (+ Object).
If the subject is simply a lone relative pronoun, then one finds either

 	 	Rel.Pron. + Verb (+ Adverb) (+ Object), or
 	 	Rel.Pron. + Adverb + Verb (+ Object).
Statements of existence of the sort 'there is...', 'there are...' place the subject or topic first, with no blank pronoun or adverb as in Modern English. Thus Margar sagnir eru... means 'There are great stories...'. Contrast Þar er nú hǫfuðstaðr... 'There is the capital...'; þar always has a specifically locative connotation and is not equivalent to 'there' in Modern English existential 'there is/are...' constructions. Truly impersonal constructions arise in the order

 	 	Verb (+ Adverb) + Object.
The subject is not expressed; such constructions are often equivalent to a passive in Modern English: Skal hér nefna suma þeira ('Shall here name some of them') 'Here some of them shall be named.'

An adjective may either precede or follow the noun it modifies. They agree in gender, case, and number. A plural adjective or pronoun referring to two nouns of different gender is put in the neuter, e.g. vit skulum aka tvau 'we two (Thor (masc.) and Freya (fem.)) shall drive together'. An emphatic adjective generally precedes the noun, but this practice varies quite frequently for stylistic reasons, especially to avoid repetitive constructions. A possessive pronoun generally follows the noun it governs, e.g. skip hans 'his ship'; the alternate hans skip places emphasis on the pronoun. Though there is a definite article in ON, it typically does not modify a noun governed by a genitive, e.g. jarlar konungs 'the earls of the king'. The genitive itself, however, may take a definite article: konungr landsins 'the king of the land'.

When a plural subject follows the verb, a preceding pronoun or noun referring to the subject might be put in the singular. The verb may be singular, though usually plural: þat eru nú fjǫrur kallaðar 'that's now called the fore-shore(s).'

The Farmstead
Contrary to what the records of Continental Europe would have us believe, viking life consisted more of farming than of going 'a-viking'. Even for those adventurers who did join the raiding parties, it was essentially a seasonal activity, with the off-season involving tending to matters at the homestead. Though the disparate lands and climates inhabited by the Scandinavians led to a diversity of home activities, there are a few general trends of the society as a whole. In all the reaches of their expanse, the Scandinavians tended animals, mostly for dairy products, but also for meat and hides. This practice was mixed with genuine agriculture, particularly the cultivation of grains. Where the land was more fertile in the southern regions, cultivation made up the greater portion of the farming endeavor; but as one proceeds farther north and the land becomes less tillable, the rearing of animals takes over as the farming mainstay. In the eastern regions, these farming practices were typically supplemented by hunting wild animals and birds. Fishing and the hunting of seals, walruses, and whales were part of the general Scandinavian arsenal, not only for sustinence, but also for purposes of trading hides, ivory, and oil.

Viking house of Fyrkat

There were a few common methods of constructing the houses and other farm buildings. By far the most prevalent, both for the convenience of the materials and the readiness of construction, was turf construction. Walls would be heaped up from the surrounding turf, and wood would only be used to form the roof. In those regions more dense with wooded areas, houses would be built from timber. One method involved using vertical planks set edge-to-edge; another method involved placing horizontal planks between vertical posts.

Scandinavian house design was quite consistent over the wide region of their expanse. The basic house consisted of one long room, anywhere from 40 to 100 feet long, and tapering at either end in a fashion similar to a ship's hull. Two rows of posts ran along the middle to support the weight of the roof. Along each long wall ran a floor of raised earth, held with smooth boards or stone. The central floor sat below these, the center occupied by one or more stone-lined hearths and a cooking pit. In the earliest days these structures seemed to house both humans and animals, but by the time of the Viking Age, the farm animals were relegated to separate structures either appended to the long house or set off at a distance. The long house itself was often sectioned by wooden walls enclosing small areas at either end for storage and sleeping quarters. Later houses separated the kitchen, some walled off an entrance area, and others separated sleeping quarters from the rooms of daytime activities. The later houses lost the characteristic curve of the long walls.

This postage stamp from the Faroe Islands depicts the correspondence of the superstructure of a typical Viking Age house with the outline of the foundation and hearth frequently encountered in archaeological excavations.  Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.
An entire farmstead, of course, consisted of more than just a single dwelling. The excavations at Jarlshof in the Shetlands have uncovered the development of a farmstead which seems to have occured in stages. The original long house seems to have been built first, only followed some 40 or 50 years later by other structures. A second long house was built, presumably for the next generation, divided into a dwelling space and a cowhouse. Near the orignal long house was a separate outhouse divided into sections. There was also a separate stable, with cobbled floor, and a smithy separate from these, containing an anvil, hearth, and lumps of iron slag. There was yet another separate structure, whose purpose is not altogether clear, but was perhaps a barn.

The farming year began when the snow melted. This exposed the grass for grazing the cattle, and marked the time for planting cereal crops. Primarily these consisted of barley and oats. The plough was usually drawn by oxen, and was made in two styles. One was a wheel-drawn plough which was very heavy, and another was a lighter plough merely held and guided by the farmer. This was also the time to replenish the fuel stores by digging peat and cutting wood.

The period from roughly May to June consisted of weaning the lambs, shearing the flocks, and finally driving the animals to upland pastures in the hills. In this upland area a farm typically had a separate living quarter where some of the household would live during the summer months. The cows would be milked and butter and cheese would be made.

Following this, a period of haymaking began in July and continued through August and into September. Grass was cut, rolled to dry, and stored in barns or protected with turf. This period overlapped with the harvest, which began in late August or early September. At the same time, livestock was gathered from the hills, and the owner would make an estimate based on the harvest as to how many animals could be kept alive for the winter. The rest were slaughtered and their meat dried. The winter months were devoted to work inside as much as possible. Often animals would be left outside in the cold as much as they could handle it, but the cows could not endure such conditions, and so were kept inside and hay brought to them. Women often took to indoor necessities such as weaving and needlework, using the wool cut earlier in the year.

Author Introduction
Snorri Sturluson (1179-1241) is generally viewed by historians as the educated Scandinavian par excellence, a leading figure in the social, political, and literary life of Iceland at the time. Snorri travelled on at least two occasions to the court of the Norwegian king Hákon Hákonarson and appears to have agreed to promote the interests of the king and his father-in-law Skúli in Iceland. Skúli rebelled, however, against the king and was eventually killed in 1240. Snorri too fell out of favor with the king; eventually he was killed in his own home on the orders of the Icelander Gizurr Þorvaldsson.

Snorri has a great literary corpus to his credit. His literary productivity is at times extended too far, as historians attempt to assign to his authorship this and that extant work of unknown provenance. But several works are fairly certainly ascribed to Snorri. Several of his poems are quoted in Sturlunga saga and Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar. Heimskringla, a collection of stories of legendary and historical kings of Norway, was likely compiled by Snorri. Some ascribe Egils saga to Snorri's talent, but there is no direct evidence for such a claim.

The Prose Edda is paramount among Snorri's literary contributions. The work is in three parts: the Prologue and Gylfaginning, containing accounts of the mythology of Scandinavia; the Skáldskaparmál ('poetic diction'), a treatise on the mechanics of poetic composition; and the Háttatál, a description of poetic verse-forms.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage begins the Prologue of Snorri's Edda. Lest one be lulled into believing that Iceland was the last bastion of true polytheistic worship in medieval Europe, the passage below clearly illustrates that, by Snorri's time, Christianity had found firm footing on this isolated island. Certainly Scandinavians, and Icelanders in particular, had held on to earlier beliefs until a relatively late date. But the following passage makes clear that, at least in many educated circles, the remants of the older ways were being reinterpreted from a Christian viewpoint. In this way, Snorri's Prologue is strikingly modern in its stance and tone.

Translation
Almighty God created heaven and earth and all the things which belong to them, and finally two people from whom races descended, Adam and Eve, and their progeny multiplied and dispersed across all the land. But as time went by, the people diversified: some were good and very faithful, but far more took to the pleasures of the land and spurned God's command, and therefore God submerged the land in a flood, as well as all the creatures of the land, save those which were with Noah in the ark. After Noah's flood, eight men lived who settled the land and races descended from them, and just as before it happened that when the world was populated and settled, it occurred that the majority of the population preferred hunger for wealth and glory and set aside obedience to God, and this went so far that they no longer desired to speak the name of God. But who then could tell their children about God's great works? So it came about that they forgot God's name and in most places around the world a man could not be found who knew the details of his creator. But nonetheless God gave them earthly gifts, property and prosperity, which they should possess on the land. He also distributed wisdom so that they distinguished all the earthly things and all the details of the air and the earth which one could discern. They contemplated this and wondered what it might mean that the earth and the animals and the birds had the same nature in certain respects and nevertheless there was dissimilarity in type. One characteristic was that the earth was piled up in high mountaintops and there water sprang forth and there was no need to dig further for water than in deep valleys. And such are the animals and birds, so that it is equally far for the blood to the head or feet. Another feature of the earth is that each year greenery grows on the earth, and flowers, and in the same year it all falls and fades. And such are the animals and birds, so that hair and feathers grow upon them and fall off each year. The third characteristic of the earth is when it is opened and dug up, then the grass grows in the soil which is topmost on the earth. They likened the rocks and stones to the teeth and bones of living creatures. From this they reasoned that the earth could be living and have life of a certain sort, and they understood this, that she was exceedingly old in years and rich in character. She fed all the living creatures and took to herself all that died. For that reason they gave her a name and traced their ancestry to her.
Grammar
6 Further Sound Rules
The major sound rules of Old Norse are treated in Lesson 1. In an attempt at greater completeness, a few of the more dominant sound rules are discussed below.

6.1 Syncope and Contraction
Syncope refers to the situation in which short, unaccented vowels were dropped, e.g. himin + i > himni. Short vowels bearing secondary accent are weakened.

Contraction occurrs when an unaccented vowel comes to stand directly after an accented vowel. They contract if both are back vowels (except úa, óa, and sometimes úu), or if both front vowels. Hence fá from *fáa. A back vowel followed by a front vowel remains, e.g. búinn. A front vowel followed by a back vowel creates a diphthong, e.g. *féar > fjar (G sg. of fé); *knéum > knjám or knjóm (D pl. of kné).

6.2 Breaking
Breaking, or fracture, is a process by which a simple vowel becomes a diphthong in certain environments. In ON, the only vowel subject to breaking was the underlying *e in Proto-Norse (PN). The mechanism of fracture in ON continues to be debated. Heuristically, we may say that *e > ja; hence ON gjalda beside OE geldan; ON jafn beside OE efen. Such fracture is typical in verbs of the strong third conjugation, but not in verbs of the fourth or fifth conjugations, e.g. PN *getan > ON geta. When the following syllable contains u (which may or may not have disappeared by the time of ON), then there is the further evolution *e > ja > jǫ; e.g. PN *meku > ON mjǫk. Fracture does not occur at all if *e is preceded by v, l, or r, e.g. verða, leðr. In a few masculine nouns, all forms exhibit fracture except the dative singular and nominative plural, where the original PN *e remains as ON i: skjǫldr 'shield' has A Sg. skjǫld, G sg. skjaldar, A pl. skjǫldu, G pl. skjalda, D pl. skjǫldum; but D sg. skildi (perhaps from *skeldiu), N pl. skildir (perhaps from *skeldiur). All such nouns have jǫ in the N sg.

6.3 Raising
Original *e may be raised, or fronted, to i in the j-augmented present stem of certain class five strong verbs, e.g. *beðjan > biðja. The shift *e > i happens elsewhere, and seems to date to a period different from that in which i-umlaut affected the back vowels. It is often a matter of some dispute as to whether a given form is the result of this process or the process of i-umlaut discussed in Lesson 1.

6.4 Lengthening and Shortening
A stressed vowel in final position is long, e.g. þú. This occurs even when loss of a final consonant leaves a stressed vowel in final position, e.g. *vag > vá 'slew', past tense of vega 'to slay'.

Long vowels are often shortened before consonant clusters. This occurs particularly before double consonants. Compare neuter gott with masculine góðr; minn with feminine mín. The diphthong ei is shortened to e, hence ekki from eitt + gi.

6.5 Retention of Semi-Vowels
Original j dropped at the beginning of words. Hence ON ungr beside OE geong. Initial j in ON is of different origin (see above on Breaking). Medial j dropped before the front vowels i, y, ø, œ, and sometimes e. Medial j remains before other vowels, if it follows a short syllable (including in many instances those ending in a long vowel or diphthong), or following a g or k: e.g. veljum (1st pl.) vs. velið (2nd pl.).  This j appears as i after a long syllable, or after a g ending a short syllable.  By contrast the i of a stem appears before back vowels a and u as j when it follows a long syllable with final velar g or k: e.g. elgja (gen. pl.) from elgr 'elk', beside elgi (acc. pl.).

Original w (v in Icelandic orthography) dropped initially when preceding l or r, hence ON líta beside OE wlitan. w dropped before round vowels u, y, o, ø, œ, but not ǫ. Thus urðu and orðinn, past tense and participle of verða; also ON œpa beside OE wēpan. w dropped after ó and ú, hence ON glóa beside OE glowan. w disappeared before consonants and at the end of words, cf. sær, with G sg. sævar; ǫr, with G sg. ǫrvar. Medial w remains when following a short syllable, or following g or k: bǫð, with G sg. bǫðvar.  The -w- stem augment in verbs generally appears before a and i.  Thus søkkva (infinitive) 'to sink', but søkkum (1st pl.) 'we sink'.

7 Strong Declension
7.1 i-Stems
Several nouns have stems with an i-suffix. In some nouns, such as gestr, this caused i-umlaut which carried through the entire paradigm (contrast Goth. gasts). In other nouns, such as staðr, this situation did not obtain. The nouns staðr 'place', gestr 'guest', and bekkr 'bench' illustrate the masculine forms.

 	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	stað-i-	 	gest-i-	 	bekk-i-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	staðr	 	gestr	 	bekkr
A	 	stað	 	gest	 	bekk
G	 	staðar	 	gests	 	bekks, bekkjar
D	 	stað	 	gest(i)	 	bekk
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	staðir	 	gestir	 	bekkir
A	 	staði	 	gesti	 	bekki
G	 	staða	 	gesta	 	bekkja
D	 	stǫðum	 	gestum	 	bekkjum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
On the appearance of the j in certain forms, see Section 6.5 above.

The nouns nauð(r) 'distress', þǫkk 'thanks', and hǫll 'hall' illustrate the declension of feminine i-stems.

 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stems	 	nauð-i-	 	þakk-i-	 	hall-i-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	nauð(r)	 	þǫkk	 	hǫll
A	 	nauð	 	þǫkk	 	hǫll
G	 	nauðar	 	þakkar	 	hallar
D	 	nauð	 	þǫkk	 	hǫll(u)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	nauðir	 	þakkir	 	hallir
A	 	nauðir	 	þakkir	 	hallir
G	 	nauða	 	þakka	 	halla
D	 	nauðum	 	þǫkkum	 	hǫllum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
These forms are actually a confluence of the feminine ō-stems and the i-stems. nauðr may be traced back to an original i-stem (cf. Goth. nauþs, N pl. nauþeis), but other words like þǫkk and hǫll were original ō-stems which adopted the N pl. of the i-stems.

7.2 u-Stems
The u-stem nouns were all masculine. Some of these underwent fracture in the root vowel in all forms but the D sg. and N pl. These latter forms, however, were subject to i-umlaut. Elsewhere, the remaining root vowel underwent u-umlaut where possible. The words skjǫldr 'shield', vǫllr 'ground', and fǫgnuðr 'entertainment' illustrate the forms.

 	 	Masculine	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	skeld-u-	 	vall-u-	 	fagnað-u-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	skjǫldr	 	vǫllr	 	fǫgnuðr
A	 	skjǫld	 	vǫll	 	fǫgnuð
G	 	skjaldar	 	vallar	 	fagnaðar
D	 	skildi	 	velli	 	fagnaði
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	skildir	 	vellir	 	fagnaðir
A	 	skjǫldu	 	vǫllu	 	fǫgnuðu
G	 	skjalda	 	valla	 	fagnaða
D	 	skjǫldum	 	vǫllum	 	fǫgnuðum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note the absence of i-umlaut in the D sg. and N pl. of fǫgnuðr, since this process rarely applied to syllables which did not carry the primary accent.

8 Personal Pronouns
Old Norse verbal inflection is robust enough that, strictly speaking, use of subject pronouns is unnecessary. The subject pronouns are often added for emphasis. The first and second person pronouns distinguish not only singular and plural, but also dual ('we two', 'us two', 'you two', etc.).

8.1 First and Second Person Pronouns
The forms of the first and second person pronouns are as follows.

 	 	1st Pers.	 	2nd Pers.
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	ek	 	þú
A	 	mik	 	þik
G	 	mín	 	þín
D	 	mér	 	þér
 	 	 	 	 
N Du.	 	vit	 	it, þit
A	 	okkr	 	ykkr
G	 	okkar	 	ykkar
D	 	okkr	 	ykkr
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	vér	 	ér, þér
A	 	oss	 	yðr
G	 	vár	 	yðar
D	 	oss	 	yðr
 	 	 	 	 
The nominative forms are often suffixed to the verb, e.g. mæli-k 'I speak', má-k-at 'I cannot' (-at 'not', frequent in poetry). Similarly heyrðu and skaltu < skalt þú. Such occurrences with the dual and plural forms of the second person pronoun led to re-analysis on the part of the speakers: skuluð ér > skuluðér was subsequently interpreted as skulu þér. Hence the alternate forms þit and þér, and the frequent use of the 3rd person plural in place of the 2nd person.

The oblique cases are often used reflexively. The D sg. mér is often suffixed to the verb as -m, e.g. biðjum 'I ask for myself', and the A sg. mik as -mk. When added to the 3rd singular of a verb, the plural form of the verb is used instead. The suffix -mk often doubles as a form for the dative as well, hence þóttumk for þótti mér 'it seemed to me'.

8.2 Third Person Pronouns
The third person pronoun is actually a suppletive system. The masculine and feminine singular forms are built from the demonstrative hann 'this one, he'; the neuter singular and the plural of all genders are built from the þ-forms found in the demonstrative sá (masc.), sú (fem.), þat (neut.). The paradigm for the third person pronoun is given below.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hann	 	hon	 	þat
A	 	hann	 	hana	 	þat
G	 	hans	 	hennar	 	þess
D	 	honum	 	henni	 	því, þí
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þeir	 	þær	 	þau
A	 	þá	 	þær	 	þau
G	 	þeir(r)a	 	þeir(r)a	 	þeir(r)a
D	 	þeim	 	þeim	 	þeim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
This system parallels that found in modern English, with the singular forms him, her, etc., but plural forms they, them. These pronouns are not used reflexively. Instead, the following pronoun is used.

 	 	Reflexive
 	 	 
N	 	-
A	 	sik
G	 	sín
D	 	sér
 	 	 
These forms are used regardless of the gender or number of the referent. Thus sik might equally represent 'himself', 'herself', 'itself', 'themselves'; similarly for the other forms.

The form sik was often used enclitically following a verb, reduced to -sk. This form was then generalized as the marker of the middle voice.

9 Weak Conjugation
The weak verbs stand in contradistinction to the strong verbs. Unlike strong verbs, weak verbs are not characterized by vocalic alternation within the stem. This is not to say that there is no vocalic alternation; rather the vocalic alternation is a very predictable result of the applied weak verbal endings. The past forms exhibit a dental suffix -ð (in certain enviroments -d or -t), to which are appended the endings -- verbal to arrive at the finite verb forms, or nominal to yield the past participle. The same is found in English walk, with past tense walked. The d suffix is found in both the past tense ('I called my friend') and the past participle ('called on to answer, he tried to divert the question').

9.1 Weak Verb Classes
There are three classes of weak verbs. We may list the same principal parts as with the strong verbs. The verbs krefja 'demand', kalla 'call', and vaka 'wake' illustrate the classes.

Class	 	Infinitive	 	(3 Sg. Pres.)	 	3 Sg. Past	 	3 Pl. Past	 	(3 Sg. Past Subj.)	 	Past Ptcple
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	krefja 'demand'	 	krefr	 	krafði	 	krǫfðu	 	krefði	 	krafðr
II	 	kalla 'call'	 	kallar	 	kallaði	 	kǫlluðu	 	kallaði	 	kallaðr
III	 	vaka 'wake'	 	vakir	 	vakþi	 	vǫkþu	 	vekþi	 	vakat (nt.)
The 3rd pers. sg. of the present is often used as an indicator of class. At times this conflicts with historical considerations, so that some authors may assign a given verb to different classes depending on the characterization chosen. For instance, some authors assign heyra 'hear' to the first class based on historical grounds, while others assign it to the third class based on the present form. Its principal parts are given below.

Class	 	Infinitive	 	(3 Sg. Pres.)	 	3 Sg. Past	 	3 Pl. Past	 	(3 Sg. Past Subj.)	 	Past Ptcple
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I or III	 	heyra 'hear'	 	heyrir	 	heyrði	 	heyrðu	 	heyrði	 	heyrðr
9.2 Active Paradigm
The active endings of the weak verb paradigms are as follows.

Weak Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	- / -a / -i	 	-a	 	 
2	 	-r / -ar/ -ir	 	-ir	 	-
3	 	-r / -ar/ -ir	 	-i	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-um	 	-im	 	-um
2	 	-ið	 	-ið	 	-ið
3	 	-a	 	-i	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-ða	 	-ða	 	 
2	 	-ðir	 	-ðir	 	 
3	 	-ði	 	-ði	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-ðum	 	-ðim	 	 
2	 	-ðuð	 	-ðið	 	 
3	 	-ðu	 	-ði	 	 
The endings are in essence the same as those for the strong verbs, except in the past singular. The singular of the Present Indicative retains a linking vowel depending on the class of the verb (or, more specifically, on historical grounds -- cf. mention of heyra above). The -ð- in the Past forms is a suffix intervening between root and ending, and is included only to call attention to this difference from the past tense of the strong verbs (i.e. the -ð- only appears once in the verb). This -ð- may be realized as -d- or -t- in certain phonetic environments.

The conjugation of the first class verb berja 'beat' illustrates the endings.

Weak Verbs	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	ber	 	berja	 	 
2	 	berr	 	berir	 	ber
3	 	berr	 	beri	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	berjum	 	berim	 	berjum
2	 	berið	 	berið	 	berið
3	 	berja	 	beri	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	barða	 	berða	 	 
2	 	barðir	 	berðir	 	 
3	 	barði	 	berði	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	bǫrðum	 	berðim	 	 
2	 	bǫrðuð	 	berðið	 	 
3	 	bǫrðu	 	berði	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infinitive	 	berja	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	berjandi	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	bar(i)ðr	 	 	 	 
These forms are derivable from a minimal set of three principal parts, fewer than are necessary for the strong verbs. Specifically, these are the following principal parts:

infinitive: berja;
3 (or 1) sg. past indic.: barði (barða);
past participle: bariðr (neuter sg. barit).
The procedure for arriving at the verb forms is as follows:

present indic., subjunct., imperat. forms: take the infinitive stem berj-, add endings (use verb class to distinguish -r / -ar / -ir).
past indic. forms: take second principal part barði, apply u-umlaut when appropriate, add endings.
past subjunct. forms: take second principal part barði, apply rule all disyllabic past subjunctive forms with original back root vowels show i-umlaut, add endings.
present participle: take infinitive stem berj-, add endings.
past participle: take third principal part stem bar(i)ð-, add endings.
Labelling the principal part stems as (1), (2), (3), this gives the following schematic representation.

9.3 Middle Paradigm
The middle voice of the weak verbs is formed exactly as above, with the active endings replaced by the middle endings, involving the -sk suffix. The forms are given below for ease of reference.

1 Sg.	 	-umk	 	-umk

2	 	-ðuzk	 	-ðizk

This gives the following schematic representation.

Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	(1) + (u-mut.) + -umk	 	(1) + (u-mut.) + -umk

As mentioned with the strong verbs, the present participle middle is declined like the active, with -sk added after the declensional endings. The past participle is formed analogously, but is only found in the neuter.

10 Particles
Old Norse makes significant use of small words or function words to display coordination or subordination, or to shift nuance. The coordinating conjunctions ok 'and' and en 'but' typically join two parallel constructions. Less common are eða 'or' and né 'nor'. Sometimes two words are used to link constructions, such as bæði... ok 'both... and'; annattveggja... eða 'either... or'; hvárki... né 'neither... nor'.

One of the most common particles is er, which is used as an all-purpose relative (not to be confused with er, 3rd sg. pres. of vera 'be'). er most often follows a demonstrative, making it into the corresponding relative: þá 'then', beside þá er 'when'; sá 'he, that one', beside sá er '(the one) who'. More will be said concerning this particle in a later lesson.

Old Norse makes amazing use of prepositions to add nuance to verb phrases. For example, sœkja 'seek' vs. sœkja at 'attack'. One must understand that, while a preposition so added may govern its own object, it often does not. The preposition may be used in an absolute sense, while the verb itself governs an object. When the preposition is able in principle to govern nouns in the same case as the verb, the distinction may be difficult to make; certain situations, however, do make it clear that a verb may govern its object, while the preposition serves only to modify nuance. For example: sóttu at í annat sinn 'they attacked another time'. In this instance the preposition at is used absolutely, serving only to modify the verb's meaning. Another example: Gunnarr... skaut til þeira, ok kom á Eilíf Ǫnundarson, ok fekk hann af sár mikit 'Gunnar shot at them, and [the arrow] came at Eilif Onundarson, and he received a great wound.' In the last clause, fekk governs the accusative sár mikit; the latter phrase cannot be governed by af, which only takes the dative. Sometimes another particle may imply an object for the preposition, as in the following: hann finnr, at þar var stungit í sverði Sigmundar 'he notices that there it was thrust in with the sword of Sigmund'. The adverb þar points to the location to which í refers. The word sverði is an instrumental dative, and not governed by í itself.

The Old Norse use of prepositions is very close to modern English usage. For example, one can 'work a problem', or one can 'work out a problem'. In the latter, 'work' governs the object, not 'out' (we may rephrase as 'work a problem out'). What is more, one can 'work out at the gym', where now the preposition 'out' changes entirely the meaning of the verb, so that 'work out' is synonymous with 'exercise'.


Lesson 3
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum

The Gokstad Ship
It is through their seafaring skills that the Vikings entered the historical records of Western Europe, descending upon the coastal towns from the high seas. At the time the Continent encountered the Vikings, they truly wielded a mastery of the waves unparalled elsewhere in Europe, both in ship construction and in navigational skill. Fortunately some remnants of these ships have survived, so that comparison with artistic depictions in regions attacked or settled by the Scandinavians, and with the written accounts of the Scandinavians themselves, allows for a fairly robust understanding of their capabilities on the open sea.

The best preserved remnant of a Viking ship comes from a grave at Gokstad, near the Oslo Fjord. The situation of the burial was fortunate, since all of the ship below the figurehead was buried in a thick clay which lent itself to excellent preservation. The burial dates to roughly 900, and the ship measures 76 feet 6 inches from stem to stern, and 17 feet 6 inches at the beam, with a draught of some 3 feet. The keel is formed from a single oak, capped by ends which rise but whose tops have unfortunately rotted away.

The Gokstad ship, housed in the Museum of Cultural History, University of Oslo.
The rest of the hull is built clinker style from 16 planks, each overlapping the one below and riveted to it. These planks are each an inch or less thick, except for the tenth at the waterline and the fourteenth with the oarholes, both of which are slightly thicker. The planks are so thin they can be lifted by one man; they are so flexible that they can be bent with ease some 14 degrees side to side. Each plank runs the length of the ship. In order to produce such long, flexible strips of wood, the shipbuilders took the trunks of large trees and drove wedges into the wood. In contrast to sawing, which cuts across the grain, this method of splitting allows the wood to separate along its grain, leaving a strong but flexible plank. These planks are fitted to 19 ribs, spaced 3 feet apart. Above the waterline the planks are nailed to the ribs, but below they are only lashed with spruce-roots to allow the boat to expand with the stress and strain of the open sea. Employing relatively thin planks retains a light and swift structure.

The shape and construction of the ship contribute in interesting ways to its speed, which was in fact noticeably greater than that of other ships of the period. The clinker building technique, with its overlapping planks, actually forces some air down along the seams and under the ship. This has the effect of producing a faint pocket of air between the hull and the water, reducing the overall drag of the ship. Though the effect is not large, it is perhaps a factor in increasing the speed of the ship. A greater factor is the shape of the ship itself. The narrow prow giving way to a wide, flat midsection allows the ship more to skim over the water, rather than cut through it. As the speed of the boat increases, under moderate surface conditions, the hull actually lifts slightly out of the water, so that there is a mild hydroplaning effect. More than the clinker style construction, this reduces drag, thus increasing speed. These factors, coupled with the overall lightness, gave the viking ship an average speed a few knots greater than anything else sailing the ocean at the time.

The deck consists of floorboards which are not fixed to the vessel, but merely rest upon the crossbeams. They could be lifted to open up storage area, or to allow access for bailing water. Running along the ship below the floorboards is a 12 foot oaken block which served as a base for the mast when raised. The mast was steadied by a longer block above this, with a slit allowing for raising and lowering of the mast. Estimates suggest that the mast itself was approximately 40 feet high. The sail is made not of cloth but rather wool. The wool used was naturally water resistant and flexible, thus allowing the sail to flex in strong winds, yet return to its original shape. The actual rigging used is unclear, none having survived. Images of viking ships suggest that a complicated mesh of ropes may have been used to hem in the sail, perhaps with several members of the crew reigning in different sections. Whether this was the case, or alternatively a wooden yard was set through eyelets at the bottom of the sail, either method would have allowed the ship to run close to the wind. Viking ships are thus not limited to merely running with their back to the wind, but appear to have been able to tack into the wind as well.

The rudder is mounted on the right side (cf. the term starboard), and in shape is nothing more than a broadened oar. It is fastened to the ship by means of an oak block running through the ship's planks, and this in turn is fastened to a strengthened rib. There is a secondary attachment, a strap holding the rudder to the gunwale. The yard-long tiller is detachable, and decorated with a carved animal head. Releasing this strap and hauling a rope attached to the board itself allows the rudder to be raised in shallow water. When fully extended into the water, the rudder projects 18 inches below the keel, providing good lateral resistance.

Introduction
The authorship of Grettis saga is uncertain, as are the origins of many aspects of the story itself. Grettir the Strong was apparently an outlaw in Iceland who lived from 996-1031 AD. The composition of the saga itself, in the form we have it, dates from the 14th century. It is not clear how much of the story is based on actual exploits of the man himself and how much was added from other storytelling traditions current at the time. Many scholars find, within the narrative, elements of the story of Beowulf, and for this reason they suspect that the two tales are in fact variants of the same story. In this view, Beowulf is the high-style retelling, while Grettis saga is the more straightforward, action-packed version. The parallels stem from similar motifs in the primary battles, namely descent into the unknown, the slaying of a beast, the severing of an arm, and retrieval of a weapon. Grettir fights with Glám, a rather typical example of the Icelandic notion of a ghost, more substantial than modern notions of some ethereal vapor, and then fights with the troll-wife. This sequence parallels Beowulf's fight with Grendel and then his mother.

Grettis saga is not only noteworthy for its possible literary heritage. The saga affords one of the few clear descriptions of Scandinavian household layout for the period. The house is described as one large room in which all domestic activities take place. For a time, scholars studying the terminology of other literary records believed that this depiction was too primitive for Viking Age homes, and that other literature suggested more complex structures. In the end, archaeology proved Grettis saga correct; other sagas give misleading descriptions of structures of the time, and still others use terminology too vague to lead to any definite conclusions.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage from chapter 35 begins the scene of Grettir's fight with Glám. The narrative style is simple and direct. The beginning shows the slow build up and suspense of any modern ghost story or thriller. Many of the details of the fight parallel Beowulf's fight with Grendel, such as the contest of sheer strength rather than weaponry; even the emotional content is similar, with Grendel's surprise at Beowulf's strength and his desire to flee all displayed by Glám in the following narrative.

Lesson Text
Ljós brann í skálanum um nóttina. Ok er af mundi þriðjungr at nótt, heyrði Grettir út dunur miklar. Var þá farit upp á húsin ok riðit skálanum ok barit hælunum, svá at brakaði í hverju tré. Því gekk lengi; þá var farit ofan af húsinum ok til dura gengit. Ok er upp var lokit hurðunni, sá Grettir at þrællinn rétti inn hǫfuðit, ok sýndisk honum afskræmiliga mikit ok undarliga stórskorit. Glámr fór seint ok réttisk upp, er hann kom inn í dyrnar. Hann gnæfaði ofarliga við ræfrinu. Snýr skálanum ok lagði handlegginn upp á þvertréit ok gægðisk inn yfir skálann. Ekki lét bóndi heyra til sín, því at honum þótti œrit um, er hann heyrði hvat um var úti. Grettir lá kyrr ok hrœrði sik hvergi. Glámr sá at hrúga nǫkkur lá í setinu, ok rézk nú innar eptir skálanum ok þreif í feldinn stundar fast. Grettir spyrndi í stokkinn ok gekk því hvergi. Glámr hnykti í annat sinn miklu fastara, ok bifaðisk hvergi feldrinn. Í þriðja sinn þreif hann í með báðum hǫndum svá fast at hann rétti Gretti upp ór setinu; kiptu nú í sundr feldinum í millum sín.

Glámr leit á slitrit er hann helt á, ok undraðisk mjǫk hverr svá fast mundi togask við hann. Ok í því hljóp Grettir undir hendr honum ok þreif um hann miðjan ok spenti á honum hrygginn sem fastast gat hann, ok ætlaði hann at Glámr skyldi kikna við. En þrællinn lagði at handleggjum Grettis svá fast at hann hǫrfaði allr fyrir orku sakir. Fór Grettir þá undan í ýmis setin. Gengu þá frá stokkarnir, ok alt brotnaði þat sem fyrir varð. Vildi Glámr leita út, en Grettir fœrði við fœtr hvar sem hann mátti. En þó gat Glámr dregit hann fram ór skálanum. Áttu þeir þá allharða sókn, því at þrællinn ætlaði at koma honum út ór bœnum; en svá ilt sem at eiga var við Glám inni, þá sá Grettir at þó var verra at fásk við hann úti, ok því brauzk hann í móti af ǫllu afli at fara út. Glámr fœrðisk í aukana ok knepti hann at sér, er þeir komu í anddyrit. Ok er Grettir sér at hann fekk eigi við spornat, hefir hann alt eitt atriðit at hann hleypr sem harðast í fang þrælnum ok spyrnir báðum fótum í jarðfastan stein, er stóð í durunum. Við þessu bjósk þrællinn eigi; hann hafði þá togazk við at draga Gretti at sér, ok því kiknaði Glámr á bak aptr ok rauk ǫfugr út á dyrnar, svá at herðarnar námu uppdyrit ok ræfrit gekk í sundr, bæði viðirnir ok þekjan frerin; fell hann svá opinn ok ǫfugr út ór húsinu, en Grettir á hann ofan.
Translation
A light burned in the hall through the night. And as the third part of the night passed, Grettir heard great rumblings outside. It came up to the house and passed into the hall and struck with its heels, so that it creaked on every beam. This went on for a bit; then it went from the house and came to the doors. And as the door came open, Grettir watched as the thrall poked his head inside, and seemed to him hideously powerful and outlandishly huge. Glam advanced slowly and stood upright as he came inside through the doors. He extended right up to the roof. He turned to the hall and set his arm upon the crossbeam and peered in across the hall. The yeoman let no sound escape, and this seemed to him sufficient, when he heard what all was outside. Grettir lay quiet and moved not a bit. Glam noticed that some heap lay along the sideboards, and now made his way farther in along the hall and took a strong hold of the cloak. Grettir braced against the plank and did not move at all. Glam pulled a second time, much harder, but the cloak would not budge. The third time he grabbed hold with both hands so hard that he raised Grettir up from the sideboards; they rent the cloak asunder between them.
Glam looked at the rag which he was holding and was quite astonished that someone could pull so hard against him. And at that moment Grettir lept under his hands and grabbed round his midsection and wrapped round his back as tight as he could, as he intended that Glam should give way underneath. But the thrall laid hold of Grettir's arms so tight that he completely gave way on account of his strength. Grettir then slipped away from bed to bed. The planks shot from their settings, and all that came before them was broken. Glam wanted to find a way out, but Grettir would brace his feet everyplace he tried. At last Glam was able to drag him out from the hall. They had such a fierce struggle that the thrall thought to send him out of the house; but as difficult as it was to hold up against Glam inside, nevertheless Grettir saw that it was still worse to struggle with him outside, and for this he strove against his exit with all his might. Glam struck out with everything he had and pulled him to himself as they came to the hall vestibule. And as Grettir saw that he was not able to resist, he executed one fluid motion as he lept as hard as possible against the thrall's breast and kicked him with both feet against a stone set in the ground, which stood before the door. The thrall had not prepared himself for this; he had struggled to drag Grettir to himself, and at that Glam fell to the back and tumbled backwards out towards the door, so that his shoulders struck the lintel and the roof fell apart, both the beams and the frozen thatch; he fell over and backwards out of the house, and Grettir fell on top of him.
Grammar
11 Strong Declension
The strong noun declensions discussed so far have all been formed from stems ending in a vowel. Some stems do not belong to this type, but rather end in consonants. For the most part, these are archaic holdovers from an earlier period, as is clear from the meanings of the nouns which belong to the r-declension below.

11.1 r-Stems
The r-stem nouns form a very small part of the lexicon of Old Norse, but are nevertheless high-frequency words for very important concepts. The combination of these two facts hints at the archaic nature of the declension. The nouns faðir 'father', móðir 'mother', bróðir 'brother', dóttir 'daughter', and systir 'sister' illustrate the declension. The nouns all denote familial relation, with the grammatical gender following the natural gender.

G	 	feðra	 	mœðra	 	brœðra	 	dœtra	 	systra
D	 	feðrum	 	mœðrum	 	brœðrum	 	dœtrum	 	systrum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The paradigms of móðir, bróðir, and dóttir are clearly essentially the same. They are all included for the sake of completeness, these being all of the most common r-stem nouns. The plural forms are all characterized by i-umlaut; the singular is for the most part characterized by u-umlaut in the oblique, with alternate forms containing i-umlaut.

11.2 nd-Stems
The nd-stem nouns appear to have been present participles which became frozen as substantives. The nouns bóndi 'yeoman' and gefandi 'giver' illustrate the declension.

 	 	bóndi	 	gefandi
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	bóndi	 	gefandi
A	 	bónda	 	gefanda
G	 	bónda	 	gefanda
D	 	bónda	 	gefanda
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	bœndr	 	gefendr
A	 	bœndr	 	gefendr
G	 	bónda	 	gefanda
D	 	bóndum	 	gefǫndum
 	 	 	 	 
Note the N and A plural show the same i-umlaut exhibited in the declension of the r-stem nouns.

11.3 Other Consonant Stems
Other common nouns whose stems end in consonants do not fall into declensional patterns as prevalent as those above. These are collected below. As with the declensions above, these are characterized by the ending -r in the N and A plural, which may be assimilated to the final stem consonant. These forms also exhibit i-umlaut of the root vowel.

The following nouns are masculine consonant stems: maðr 'man', nagl 'nail', mónuðr 'month', vetr 'winter', fótr 'foot'.

 	 	maðr	 	nagl	 	mónuðr	 	vetr	 	fótr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	maðr	 	nagl	 	mónuðr	 	vetr	 	fótr
A	 	mann	 	nagl	 	mónuð	 	vetr	 	fót
G	 	manns	 	nagls	 	mánaðar	 	vetrar	 	fótar
D	 	manni	 	nagli	 	mónuð	 	vetr	 	fœti
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	menn	 	negl	 	mónuðr	 	vetr	 	fœtr
A	 	menn	 	negl	 	mónuðr	 	vetr	 	fœtr
G	 	manna	 	nagla	 	mánaða	 	vetra	 	fóta
D	 	mǫnnum	 	nǫglum	 	mónuðum	 	vetrum	 	fótum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The noun mónuðr is also found as mánaðr. The common noun fingr 'finger' also follows the declension of vetr.

The following nouns are feminine consonant stems: bók 'book', tǫnn 'tooth', nátt 'night', kýr 'cow'.

 	 	bók	 	tǫnn	 	nátt, nótt	 	kýr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	bók	 	tǫnn	 	nátt, nótt	 	kýr
A	 	bók	 	tǫnn	 	nátt, nótt	 	kú
G	 	bókar, bœkr	 	tannar	 	náttar, nætr	 	kýr
D	 	bók	 	tǫnn	 	nátt, nótt	 	kú
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	bœkr	 	tennr	 	nætr	 	kýr
A	 	bœkr	 	tennr	 	nætr	 	kýr
G	 	bóka	 	tanna	 	nátta	 	kúa
D	 	bókum	 	tǫnnum	 	náttum, nóttum	 	kúm
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The noun tǫnn also shows the form teðr in the N and A plural. The alternate form for the G sg. of nátt is rare, but there are examples: sátu þeir at drykkju til miðrar nætr 'they sat drinking until midnight.'

12 Demonstratives
Old Norse makes use of several different demonstrative stems. As mentioned in Section 8.2, two different stems are used in a suppletive system to fill out the paradigm of the third person pronoun. These same stems, as well as others, were often used as deictic pronouns or adjectives, pointing to spatial (e.g. 'that dog over there'), temporal ('that day last year'), or logical ('these considerations just mentioned') proximity to or distance from the perspective of the speaker.

12.1 Pronouns & Adjectives
The demonstrative sá is used as both pronoun and adjective. Its adjectival uses range from a true deictic 'that', pointing to something relatively distant from the perspective of the speaker, to the simple article 'the', referring to a noun already mentioned. In a pronominal role, the same uses may translate as 'that one' and 'this (just mentioned)', respectively. The paradigm is as follows.

 	 	Maculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sá	 	sú	 	þat
A	 	þann	 	þá	 	þat
G	 	þess	 	þeir(r)ar	 	þess
D	 	þeim	 	þeir(r)i	 	því, þí
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þeir	 	þær	 	þau
A	 	þá	 	þær	 	þau
G	 	þeir(r)a	 	þeir(r)a	 	þeir(r)a
D	 	þeim	 	þeim	 	þeim
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
As already noted, the plural forms are used as the plural of the third person pronoun. They may often be translated simply as 'they', 'them' in this role, as opposed to the truly deictic 'those (ones)'.

The demonstrative sjá 'this (one)' refers to something relatively close in the estimation of the speaker. Like sá, it is used as both pronoun and adjective. The forms are as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sjá, þessi	 	sjá, þessi	 	þetta
A	 	þenna	 	þessa	 	þetta
G	 	þessa	 	þessar	 	þessa
D	 	þessum	 	þessi	 	þessu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þessir	 	þessar	 	þessi
A	 	þessa	 	þessar	 	þessi
G	 	þessa	 	þessa	 	þessa
D	 	þessum	 	þessum	 	þessum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Another common demonstrative is hinn. Its meaning is not as strongly marked for distance, like sá, or for proximity, like sjá. hinn is often translated as 'that', but may also be used for the second referent in constructions of the sort 'the one... the other...'. hinn thus often serves to contrast one referent with another marked by sá or sjá. The forms of hinn are as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hinn	 	hin	 	hitt
A	 	hinn	 	hina	 	hitt
G	 	hins	 	hinnar	 	hins
D	 	hinum	 	hinni	 	hinu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	hinir	 	hinar	 	hin
A	 	hina	 	hinar	 	hin
G	 	hinna	 	hinna	 	hinna
D	 	hinum	 	hinum	 	hinum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
When hitt is used as an article before an adjective, the form is shortened to hit.

12.2 Definite Article
Old Norse possesses a definite article inn. Unlike English, where the article either precedes the noun it modifies or precedes the adjective modifying the noun, the Old Norse definite article is most frequently postpositive. It typically follows the noun it modifies, or follows the adjective describing a noun. In this practice ON shows a similarity to, e.g., Old Church Slavonic. The English use and the Old Norse use of the definite article do not correlate exactly, and one finds that ON often omits the article in situations where Modern English requires it. The declension of inn parallels that of hinn, and the relation between the two is often a matter of debate. The declension of inn, when not suffixed to the substantive it modifies, is as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	inn	 	in	 	it
A	 	inn	 	ina	 	it
G	 	ins	 	innar	 	ins
D	 	inum	 	inni	 	inu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	inir	 	inar	 	in
A	 	ina	 	inar	 	in
G	 	inna	 	inna	 	inna
D	 	inum	 	inum	 	inum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
This form of the article is found in constructions which parallel those of Modern English. For example, inn blindi maðr 'the blind mann'. In such freestanding constructions, the difference between hinn and inn is slight, if present at all. Thus the preceding phrase may also be rendered hinn blindi maðr. The article is found with bare substantives, e.g. (h)inir augðu 'the rich'. Such constructions are fairly uncommon, occurring mainly when a contrast between nouns is emphasized. More typical word order is for the article and noun to follow the modified noun, e.g. Óláfr inn helgi 'Olaf the saint'; hendi inn hœgri 'the right hand'.

The article is commonly used in conjunction with other demonstratives. A typical rendering of Modern English 'the blind man' would be ON sá (h)inn blindi maðr, literally 'that the blind man'. Other variations are possible, such as maðr sá (h)inn blindi or sá maðr (h)inn blindi.

When suffixed to a noun or adjective, the forms of inn undergo some modification. The initial vowel is dropped when following a short unaccented vowel. The disyllabic forms also show the following changes:

disyllables drop the initial vowel after a long vowel;
disyllables with a single n usually drop the initial vowel also after consonants, except in the feminine A sg.
Monosyllabic forms show slightly different treatment:

 	 	monosyllables retain the initial vowel after a long vowel.
In addition, the final -m of the dative plural is dropped from the preceding noun or adjective when suffixed with -inum. For convenience, the forms of inn are listed below suffixed to some typical nouns.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	úlfr-inn	 	gjǫf-in	 	tré-it
A	 	úlf-inn	 	gjǫf-ina	 	tré-it
G	 	úlfs-ins	 	gjafar-innar	 	trés-ins
D	 	úlfi-num	 	gjǫf-inni	 	tré-nu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	úlfar-nir	 	gjafar-nar	 	tré-in
A	 	úlfa-na	 	gjafar-nar	 	tré-in
G	 	úlfa-nna	 	gjafa-nna	 	trjá-nna
D	 	úlfu-num	 	gjǫfu-num	 	trjá-num
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The following are some examples with substantives that follow weak declension (to be discussed later).

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	bogi-nn	 	kona-n	 	auga-t
A	 	boga-nn	 	konu-na	 	auga-t
G	 	boga-ns	 	konu-nnar	 	auga-ns
D	 	boga-num	 	konu-nni	 	augu-nu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	bogar-nir	 	konur-nar	 	augu-n
A	 	boga-na	 	konur-nar	 	augu-n
G	 	boga-nna	 	kvenna-nna	 	augna-nna
D	 	bogu-num	 	konu-num	 	augu-num
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The use of the suffixed article does not preclude the possibility of another preposed article, though hinn is used to avoid repetition of inn. Hence hinn hvíti bjǫrninn, literally 'the white beard-the'. Other deictics may be used as well, e.g. hǫndin sú hœgri, literally 'hand-the that white'.

13 Adjectives
Adjectives fall into two main types, strong and weak. These names (1) bear no relation to the similarly-named verbal conjugation types, and (2) have no connotations beyond signifying a binary system. The terms Type A and Type B would serve just as well. The two types do, however, display a difference in usage. To wit, strong adjectives are indefinite, weak adjectives are definite. The term 'strong adjective' is shorthand for 'an adjective exhibiting strong endings', and similarly for 'weak adjective'. Any adjective may be declined according to either the strong or weak paradigms. The classification as 'strong' or 'weak' is not inherent when applied to adjectives, but merely describes a particular instance. This differs from the use of the same terms when applied to nouns, which are inherently either strong or weak. A weak noun is always weak; a weak adjective may also be declined as strong. In respect to paradigms, the endings of strong adjectives resemble those of strong nouns; likewise for weak adjectives and nouns.

13.1 Strong Declension
The adjective endings differ slightly from those of the nouns. They are listed below. Whenever the ending begins with u, the stem vowel is subject to the same u-umlaut found among the nouns. This umlaut is also found in other situations where the ending no longer displays u; such forms are so marked.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-r	 	(u-umlaut)	 	-t
A	 	-an	 	-a	 	-t
G	 	-s	 	-rar	 	-s
D	 	-um	 	-ri	 	-u
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-ir	 	-ar	 	(u-umlaut)
A	 	-a	 	-ar	 	(u-umlaut)
G	 	-ra	 	-ra	 	-ra
D	 	-um	 	-um	 	-um
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The adjectives sterkr 'strong', vænn 'handsome', gamall 'old', nýr 'new', frægr 'famous', rǫskr 'brave' illustrate the paradigms. The masculine forms are as follows.

Stem	 	sterk-	 	væn-	 	gamal-	 	nýj-	 	frægj-	 	rǫskv-

G	 	sterkra	 	vænna	 	gamalla	 	nýrra	 	frægra	 	rǫskra
D	 	sterkum	 	vænum	 	gǫmlum	 	nýjum	 	frægjum	 	rǫskum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The feminine forms are as follows.

Stem	 	sterk-	 	væn-	 	gamal-	 	nýj-	 	frægj-	 	rǫskv-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sterk	 	væn	 	gǫmul	 	ný	 	fræg	 	rǫsk
A	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva
G	 	sterkrar	 	vænnar	 	gamallar	 	nýrrar	 	frægrar	 	rǫskrar
D	 	sterkri	 	vænni	 	gamalli	 	nýrri	 	frægri	 	rǫskri

The neuter forms are as follows. Note the overall similarity with the masculine forms.

Stem	 	sterk-	 	væn-	 	gamal-	 	nýj-	 	frægj-	 	rǫskv-

A	 	sterkt	 	vænt	 	gamalt	 	nýtt	 	frægt	 	rǫskt
G	 	sterks	 	væns	 	gamals	 	nýs	 	frægs	 	rǫsks
D	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	sterk	 	væn	 	gǫmul	 	ný	 	fræg	 	rǫsk
A	 	sterk	 	væn	 	gǫmul	 	ný	 	fræg	 	rǫsk
G	 	sterkra	 	vænna	 	gamalla	 	nýrra	 	frægra	 	rǫskra
D	 	sterkum	 	vænum	 	gǫmlum	 	nýjum	 	frægjum	 	rǫskum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Some adjectives have stems ending in -r. Such adjectives drop the ending -r, so that, e.g., N sg. masc. fagr contrasts with N sg. fem. fǫgr and neut. fagrt. The endings beginning with -r- show assimilation of the r to a preceding l or single n.

Adjectives whose stem ends in a stressed long vowel double the -t of the neuter N sg. ending. Hence fár shows N sg. neut. fátt. Contraction occurs when the ending begins with a or u, e.g. fán and fám, but fáir.

Adjectives ending in -inn -- particularly, but not exclusively, the past participles of strong verbs -- show the ending -n rather than -an in the masculine A sg. Compare inn, with A sg. masc. inn; hverr, A sg. masc. hvern; nǫkkurr, A sg. masc. nǫkkurn.

13.2 Declension of annarr
The declension of annarr 'other, another; second, next' always follows the pattern of strong adjectives. Some forms display the stem aðr- rather than ann-. Its declension is as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	annarr	 	ǫnnur	 	annat
A	 	annan	 	aðra	 	annat
G	 	annars	 	annarrar	 	annars
D	 	ǫðrum	 	annarri	 	ǫðrum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	aðrir	 	aðrar	 	ǫnnur
A	 	aðra	 	aðrar	 	ǫnnur
G	 	annarra	 	annarra	 	annarra
D	 	ǫðrum	 	ǫðrum	 	ǫðrum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
13.3 Possessive Adjectives
The possessive adjectives were derived from the genitive forms of the personal pronouns. This genitive form was taken as stem, and the strong adjective endings were suffixed. For example, ek 'I', with G sg. mín 'of me', gives adjectival *mín-r > minn 'my' (N sg. masc.). As this example shows, the stem vowel is shortened before a double consonant. The paradigm of minn 'my' is given below.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	minn	 	mín	 	mitt
A	 	minn	 	mína	 	mitt
G	 	míns	 	minnar	 	míns
D	 	mínum	 	minni	 	mínu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	mínir	 	mínar	 	mín
A	 	mína	 	mínar	 	mín
G	 	minna	 	minna	 	minna
D	 	mínum	 	mínum	 	mínum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The second person builds a possessive adjective þinn, and the reflexive pronoun has possessive sinn. The dual and plural forms of the personal pronouns also build possessives:

Person	 	Stem	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	mín-	 	minn	 	mín	 	mitt
2	 	þín-	 	þinn	 	þín	 	þitt
reflex.	 	sín-	 	sinn	 	sín	 	sitt
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Du.	 	okkar-	 	okkarr	 	okkur	 	okkart
2	 	ykkar-	 	ykkarr	 	ykkur	 	ykkart
-	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	vár-	 	várr	 	vár	 	várt
2	 	yð(v)ar-	 	yð(v)arr	 	yður	 	yð(v)art
-	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The reflexive possessive adjective sinn serves as a reflexive for any number, just as the pronoun itself. The declension of várr 'our' is given below.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	várr	 	vár	 	várt
A	 	váran, várn	 	vára	 	várt
G	 	várs	 	várrar	 	várs
D	 	várum	 	várri	 	váru
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	várir	 	várar	 	vár
A	 	vára	 	várar	 	vár
G	 	várra	 	várra	 	várra
D	 	várum	 	várum	 	várum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note the stem vowel of várr does not undergo shortening. The second vowel of the short yðar- is dropped in trisyllabic forms, while the second vowel is retained everywhere in the full form yðvar-. Hence D sg. masc. yðrum, but G sg. fem. yðrar or yðvarrar. The stems ykkar- and okkar- optionally drop the second stem vowel in trisyllabic forms: A sg. masc. okkurum, ykkurum or okkrum, ykkrum.

The third person pronouns have no corresponding possessive adjectives, using simply the genitive forms of the pronoun: singular hans, hennar, þess; plural þeira.

14 Past Participle
Old Norse, like Modern English, has a past participle, whose formation depends on whether the verb is strong or weak. Unlike, e.g., classical Greek, which has morphologically distinct past active and past passive participles, Old Norse makes no morphological distinction between active and passive participles. One and the same formation generally has different interpretations based on the transitivity of the root: the past participle of transitive verbs is construed as passive ('having been done'), while the past participle of intransitive verbs is construed as active ('having done').

14.1 Formation
The formation of past participles in Old Norse parallels that of Modern English. There are two types of past participles, reflecting the distinction between strong and weak verbs. Strong verbs form the past participle by adding the suffix -in to the verbal stem, which in general displays ablaut. Compare Modern English eat-en. Adjective endings are then added to the -in suffix. Because of the relative unpredictability of ablaut, the past participle is typically given as one of the principal parts. The past participle kominn, from koma 'come', serves to illustrate the forms of the strong past participle.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	kominn	 	komin	 	komit
A	 	kominn	 	komna	 	komit
G	 	komins	 	kominnar	 	komins
D	 	komnum	 	kominni	 	komnu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	komnir	 	komnar	 	komin
A	 	komna	 	komnar	 	komin
G	 	kominna	 	kominna	 	kominna
D	 	komnum	 	komnum	 	komnum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Weak verbs form the past participle by means of a dental suffix -ð. Compare Modern English ask-ed. This is added to the stem, sometimes with an intervening vowel, and adjective endings are added to this. For example, kalla 'call' (stem kall-a-) forms past participle kallað-; spyrja 'find out' (stem spur-j-) forms spurð-; stefna 'aim' (stem stafn-j-) forms stefnð-; lifa 'live' (stem lif-i-) forms lifað-; ná 'reach' (stem ná-i-) forms náð-; hafa 'have' forms hafð-.

As mentioned above, the past participle of transitive verbs is construed as passive in sense; the past participle of intransitive verbs is construed as active. For example, koma 'to come' (intransitive) vs. kominn 'come' (active -- cf. Shakespearean 'I am come' = 'I have arrived'), but bera 'to bear' (transitive) vs. borinn 'borne' (passive); likewise elska 'to love' (transitive) vs. elskaðr 'loved' (passive), but þegja 'be silent' (intransitive) vs. þagat '(having been or become) silent' (active).

14.2 Supine
The supine in Old Norse is rather different from the concept of the same name in say Latin or Old Church Slavonic. The supine refers to the use of the neuter N/A sg. form of the past participle in conjunction with forms of the verb hafa 'have' to form a compound past tense. For example, vega 'slay' forms past participle vegin-; then hafa vegit is 'to have slain'. Similarly hafði vegit 'he had slain'; eptir at hafa vegit... 'after having slain...'.

Historically one finds that constructions like 'I have slain a man' came about from phrases like 'I have a man (who is) slain', where 'slain' is an adjective agreeing with 'a man', which is in turn the direct object of 'have'. Examples of this are found especially in early ON texts, for example Vǫluspá: hverir hafði lopt alt lævi blandit eða ætt iotuns Óðs mey gefna 'who had filled all the air with calamity or given Od's wife to the giant's race'. Here blandit is neuter accusative singular in agreement with lopt, and gefna feminine accusative singular with mey. These constructions began to give ground to use of the supine, so that by the time of classical ON texts, the two usages are in free variation. In constructions with the supine, the neuter singular form of the participle is used regardless of the gender and number of the direct object: sýndisk nú ǫllum sem Loki hefði látit leikinn 'it appeared to everyone like Loki had lost the contest', where látit is a supine, and leikinn is masculine accusative singular. The construction with the supine is also found with intransitive verbs: ekki hafa hér komit þeir menn 'men have not come here'.

15 Prepositions
Old Norse makes exceptional use of prepositions, both in prepositional phrases and in absolute uses as adverbs. This is similar to the situation in Modern English, where one can say both 'He walked in the house' and 'He walked in without saying hello'; in the former, the preposition in governs an object, in the latter it does not. Each ON preposition governs objects in one or more of the oblique cases. The case governed is a property of the preposition: each preposition governs only a specific case or cases. If a preposition governs more than one case, its meaning may change depending on the case employed. Prepositions rarely govern objects in the genitive case; the accusative and dative are quite common. Generally the dative is used after a preposition to denote position in space or time without motion, or to denote source, cause, or instrument. The accusative is used after a preposition to denote motion to or through space or time, or to denote a point of time within a certain period, opposition, or correspondence. At times a preposition together with its object may serve as a compound preposition, in the same manner as Modern English 'for the sake of'. The primary ON prepositions are listed below, together with the cases they govern and the associated meanings.

Women in Viking Society
Goddess Freyja from a 17th century manuscript

Women in Norse culture enjoyed a fair bit more stature than those of many other concurrent cultures in Europe. The culture prized women who were autonomous and spirited. The narrative of the legendary swordswoman Hervǫr, daughter and heir to the berserker warrior Angantýr, suggests at the very least that post-Viking saga audiences did not find the idea of heroic warrior ancestresses impossible. It is unclear how often this happened in reality, but the sagas are filled with women who goad their husbands into action with taunts and jibes.

Though a man might often consort with many concubines under one roof, the legal wife's status was ensured primarily by the 'bride-price' paid by her husband. This bride-price, as well as a gift given by the husband to his wife the day after the wedding, remained the property of the wife. Her father also supplied a dowry for the wedding, but this was repaid if the marriage terminated in divorce. A wife did not take the name of her husband, but kept her own patronymic, and was free to ally with either family if they fell into dispute. A wife was as free as a husband to seek divorce. The sagas tell of impotence, the husband wearing an effeminate shirt, and the woman wearing pants as grounds for divorce. The method of divorce was simple: gather witnesses, state the particular complaint, and the intention to divorce. The result seemed to carry no social stigma for either party.

Children in Viking Society
Children were generally reared at home, provided they had not been drowned or left out to die of exposure after birth (a measure generally made on grounds of the family's economic situation or because of deformity or other poor health). It was not uncommon, however, for a male child to go to live with another family as a foster-son. This secured ties between families, and in disputes a child would often rely as much upon his foster family as on his own. Children were expected to labor at the household duties. Nevertheless a certain argumentative and unruly nature was not only tolerated, but generally praised.

Illegitimate children were not altogether without rights. They might receive a small amount of the blood-money paid for their father or brother, or could inherit items of minor worth from the father. Often the status of a concubine was not very distinct from that of a legal wife, and in this situation the concubine's child would be treated little different from the wife's. A father might even adopt the illegitimate child, giving legal equality with the legitimate children.

A boy became a legal adult at 12, though usually he stayed at home for a few years more. This early adulthood was often the time for roaming with viking expeditions. Such exploits might last for several years. Typically one would return after some period to a life of farming. But the youth might just as well continue such escapades or take up residence in the retinue of some local leader. After marriage, a son could either take up residence in his father's house, or build one nearby. In Iceland he would typically settle miles away from the father's homestead.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The author of Brennu-Njáls saga is unknown. The saga as we have it dates from roughly 1250-1275 AD. The saga really contains three stories. The first is the story of Gunnar, in which Njál plays a somewhat incidental role. The harsh mannerisms of Gunnar's wife caused many to hold hostility toward Gunnar. After a fight Gunnar was unjustly sentenced to exile, but at the point of departure he could not bring himself to leave the land he held so dear. He stayed as an outlaw, which permitted his enemies to kill him legally.

Njál's story comes to center stage in the following episodes. Njál is known as a wise and generous man, but the impetuous nature of his sons finally brings about his doom. When they slay a man by the name of Þráin, Njál attempts to put an end to the ensuing feud by adopting his son, Hǫskuld. Njál's sons soon find reason to take issue with Hǫskuld, and kill him as well. His widow's kinsman, Flosi, then takes up the cause of revenge, and this leads to Njál's death as his house goes up in flames.

The third story relates how Kári exacts revenge upon those who burned Njál and his family. He finally comes to reconciliation with Flosi.

The following passage is an excerpt from chapter 77, depicting Gunnar's death. Even in light of the ensuing tragedy, the narrative is at times comical. The attackers appear rather inept in carrying out their mission, and their continual failure leads to sarcastic banter. As with the sagas in general, the scene is filled with direct speech. Given the context, there is no reason to suspect that the speech is anything but natural and reflective of Old Norse as it was spoken at the time. This means, of course, that the statements can at times be highly idiomatic and elliptical. But patience is rewarded with witty quips and outright jokes that testify to the longevity of the saga as a popular form of entertainment.

Lesson Text
Skáli Gunnars var gǫrr af viði einum ok súðþakiðr útan, ok gluggar hjá brúnásunum ok snúin þar fyrir speld. Gunnarr svaf í lopti einu í skálanum ok Hallgerðr ok móðir hans. Þá er þeir kómu at, vissu þeir eigi hvárt Gunnarr myndi heim vera, ok báðu at einnhverr myndi fara heim fyrir ok vita hvers víss yrði, en þeir settusk niðr á vǫllinn. Þorgrímr austmaðr gekk upp á skálann; Gunnarr sér at rauðan kyrtil bar við glugginum, ok leggr út með atgeirinum á hann miðjan. Þorgrími skruppu fœtrnir ok varð lauss skjǫldrinn, ok hrataði hann ofan af þekjunni. Gengr hann síðan at þeim Gizuri, þar er þeir sátu á vellinum. Gizurr leit við honum ok mælti, "Hvárt er Gunnarr heima?" Þorgrímr svarar, "Viti þér þat, en hitt vissa ek, at atgeirr hans var heima." Síðan fell hann niðr dauðr.
Þeir sóttu þá at húsinum. Gunnarr skaut út ǫrum at þeim ok varðisk vel, ok gátu þeir ekki at gǫrt. Þá hljópu sumir á húsin ok ætluðu þaðan at sœkja. Gunnarr kom þangat at þeim ǫrunum, ok gátu þeir ekki at gǫrt, ok fór svá fram um hríð. Þeir tóku hvílð ok sóttu at í annat sinn. Gunnarr skaut enn út, ok gátu þeir ekki at gǫrt ok hrukku frá í annat sinn.
Þá mælti Gizurr Hvíti, "Sœkjum at betr, ekki verðr af oss." Gørðu þeir þá hríð ina þriðju ok váru við lengi; eptir þat hrukku þeir frá.
Gunnarr mælti, "Ǫr liggr þar úti á vegginum, ok er sú af þeira ǫrum, ok skal ek þeiri skjóta til þeira, ok er þeim þat skǫmm, ef þeir fá geig at vápnum sínum."
Móðir hans mælti, "Gør þú eigi þat, at þú vekir þá, er þeir hafa áðr frá horfit."
Gunnarr þreif ǫrina ok skaut til þeira, ok kom á Eilíf Ǫnundarson, ok fekk hann af sár mikit. Hann hafði staðit einn saman, ok vissu þeir eigi at hann var særðr.
"Hǫnd kom þar út," segir Gizurr, "ok var á gullhringr, ok tók ǫr er lá á þekjunni, ok myndi eigi út leitat viðfanga, ef gnógt væri inni, ok skulu vér nú sœkja at."
Mǫrðr mælti, "Brennu vér hann inni."
"Þat skal verða aldri," segir Gizurr, "þó at ek vita at líf mitt liggi við. Er þér sjálfrátt at leggja til ráð þau er dugi, svá slœgr maðr sem þú ert kallaðr."
Translation
Gunnar's hall was made with one beam and overlapping boards on the outside, and there were windows by the ridge-beams and shutters fastened in front of these. Gunnar slept in one loft of the hall, as well as Hallgertha and his mother. When they arrived, they did not know whether Gunnar would be at home, and they said that someone should go up to the house and find out for certain, while the others set themselves down on the ground. Thorgrim, a Norwegian, went up to the hall; Gunnar saw that he bore a red kirtle up to the window, and Gunnar shot out a spear at his midsection. Thorgrim's feet slipped and his shield came loose, and he tumbled down off the thatch. Then he went back to the rest, Gizur among them, where they sat on the ground. Gizur looked at him and said, "Is Gunnar home?"
Thorgrim answered, "You find out; but I discovered this: his spear was home." Then he fell dead.
Then they rushed at the house. Gunnar lashed out at them with arrows and defended himself well, and so they got nothing done. Then some lept upon the house and intended to attack from there. There Gunnar came at them with arrows, and again they got nothing done, and it went on like this for a while. They took a rest and then attacked a second time. Gunnar shot some more, and they got nothing done and so retreated a second time.
Then Gizur the Fair said, "Let's press harder -- nothing comes of us." Then they made a third attempt and were at it a while; after that they retreated.
Gunnar said, "An arrow is sitting out there on the wall, and it's one of their arrows; I'll shoot it at them, and it'll be a shame if they take a hit with their own weapons."
His mother said, "Don't do that, or you'll rouse them when they've already given up."
Gunnar snatched the arrow and shot at them, and it came at Eilif Onundarson, and he received a great wound. He had been standing alone, and they did not know that he was wounded.
"A hand came out", said Gizur, "and a gold ring was on it, and it took an arrow which was stuck in the thatch; it wouldn't seek supplies outside if there were enough inside -- so we should attack now."
Morth said, "Let's burn him inside."
"That won't ever happen", said Gizur, "since I know that my life will go with it. But you're free to come up with some plans that would work, as you're supposed to be a clever fellow."
Grammar
16 Weak Nominal Declension
In contrast to the situation regarding adjectives, the property of being weak or strong is inherent in any given noun. A noun is either strong or weak lexically, and does not change depending on context. Thus maðr 'man' is strong, and so takes strong nominal endings at all times. But bani 'bane' is weak, and takes weak endings always. The weak nouns are historically n-stems, and are typically classified as such in the standard grammars. The -n has dropped, however, in most forms by the period of ON. It survives only regularly in the G pl. of feminine and neuter nouns, but rarely in masculines. The -n is less common in prose, but shows up in forms other than the G pl. in poetry.

Several feminine weak nouns show j before the vowel of the case marker. In stems ending in a velar, the j drops before the G pl. -na. Thus kirkja 'church', but kirkna 'of churches'. Stems which do not end in a velar take the G pl. ending -a and retain the j, e.g. hetja 'hero' vs. hetja 'of heroes'.

The stem-final i of masculine weak nouns is retained as j when it follows a velar and precedes a or u. Thus Væringi 'Varangian' vs. N pl. Væringjar 'Varangians' and D pl. Væringjum 'to the Varangians'. The i is also retained in some nouns when preceded by non-velars.

16.1 an/jan-Stems
The an- and jan-stem weak nouns are generally masculine and neuter. The masculine nouns are characterized by the vowel -i in the N sg., while the neuter shows -a. Both genders have -a in all the singular oblique forms. The masculine nouns bogi 'bow', bryti 'bailiff', gumi 'man', and the neuter hjarta 'heart', illustrate the declension.

 	 	Masculine	 	Neuter	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	bogi-	 	bryti-	 	gumi-	 	hjarta-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	bogi	 	bryti	 	gumi	 	hjarta
A	 	boga	 	brytja	 	guma	 	hjarta
G	 	boga	 	brytja	 	guma	 	hjarta
D	 	boga	 	brytja	 	guma	 	hjarta
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	bogar	 	brytjar	 	gum(n)ar	 	hjǫrtu
A	 	boga	 	brytja	 	gum(n)a	 	hjǫrtu
G	 	boga	 	brytja	 	gumna	 	hjartna
D	 	bogum	 	brytjum	 	gum(n)um	 	hjǫrtum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
16.2 ōn/jōn-Stems
All ōn/jōn-stem weak nouns are feminine. These nouns are characterized by a stem, and hence N sg., ending in -a. The singular oblique cases end in -u. Some nouns ending in -sjá also follow this declension. The nouns saga 'tale', stjarna 'star', ásjá 'help', brynja 'mailcoat' illustrate the paradigms.

 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	saga-	 	stjarna-	 	ásjá-	 	brynja-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	saga	 	stjarna	 	ásjá	 	brynja
A	 	sǫgu	 	stjǫrnu	 	ásjá	 	brynju
G	 	sǫgu	 	stjǫrnu	 	ásjá	 	brynju
D	 	sǫgu	 	stjǫrnu	 	ásjá	 	brynju
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	sǫgur	 	stjǫrnur	 	ásjár	 	brynjur
A	 	sǫgur	 	stjǫrnur	 	ásjár	 	brynjur
G	 	sagna	 	stjarna	 	ásjá	 	brynja
D	 	sǫgum	 	stjǫrnum	 	ásjám	 	brynjum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Some nouns like ásjá could decline like á, with G sg. ásjár. The common noun kona 'woman' has G pl. kvenna or kvinna.

16.3 in-Stems
The in-stem nouns are all feminine. They are characterized by a final -i which remains as ending in all singular forms. These are typically abstract nouns, so that plural forms are rare. The nouns elli 'old age' and gørsimi 'treasure' illustrate the paradigm.

 	 	Feminine	 	 
 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	elli-	 	gørsimi-
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	elli	 	gørsimi
A	 	elli	 	gørsimi
G	 	elli	 	gørsimi
D	 	elli	 	gørsimi
 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-	 	gørsimar
A	 	-	 	gørsimar
G	 	-	 	gørsima
D	 	-	 	gørsimum
 	 	 	 	 
The declension of the plural follows that of the ō-stems.

17 Adjectives
As already mentioned, adjectives can be declined according to either weak or strong paradigms, depending on the situation at hand. The weak forms are used in modifying a definite noun, while the strong endings are used to modify an indefinite noun. For example, sterkr víkingr 'a strong viking' vs. inn sterki víkingr 'the strong viking'; fǫgr kona 'a beautiful woman' vs. in fagra kona 'the beautiful woman'; skarpt sverð 'a sharp sword' vs. it skarpa sverð 'the sharp sword'. As one can see from these examples, there is no correlation between weak nouns and weak adjectives, nor between strong nouns and strong adjectives. The strong/weak distinction is lexical when applied to nouns, situational when applied to adjectives. An adjective must be weak when the noun modified is accompanied by a definite article. Even in the absence of a definite article, a weak adjective still has definite force. Thus Helga fagra and Helga in fagra are both 'Helga the Fair'.

17.1 Weak Declension
The weak adjective endings are listed below.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-i	 	-a	 	-a
A	 	-a	 	-u	 	-a
G	 	-a	 	-u	 	-a
D	 	-a	 	-u	 	-a
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-u	 	-u	 	-u
A	 	-u	 	-u	 	-u
G	 	-u	 	-u	 	-u
D	 	-um	 	-um	 	-um
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The adjectives sterkr 'strong', vænn 'handsome', gamall 'old', nýr 'new', frægr 'famous', rǫskr 'brave' illustrate the paradigms. The masculine forms are as follows.

Stem	 	sterk-	 	væn-	 	gamal-	 	nýj-	 	frægj-	 	rǫskv-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sterki	 	væni	 	gamli	 	ný	 	frægi	 	rǫskvi
A	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva
G	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva
D	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
A	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
G	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
D	 	sterkum	 	vænum	 	gǫmlum	 	nýjum	 	frægjum	 	rǫskum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The feminine forms are as follows.

Stem	 	sterk-	 	væn-	 	gamal-	 	nýj-	 	frægj-	 	rǫskv-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva
A	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
G	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
D	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku

D	 	sterkum	 	vænum	 	gǫmlum	 	nýjum	 	frægjum	 	rǫskum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The neuter forms are as follows.

Stem	 	sterk-	 	væn-	 	gamal-	 	nýj-	 	frægj-	 	rǫskv-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva

D	 	sterka	 	væna	 	gamla	 	nýja	 	frægja	 	rǫskva
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku
A	 	sterku	 	vænu	 	gǫmlu	 	nýju	 	frægju	 	rǫsku

D	 	sterkum	 	vænum	 	gǫmlum	 	nýjum	 	frægjum	 	rǫskum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
17.2 Comparison of Adjectives
Most adjectives form the comparative by adding the suffix -ar- to the stem, and then adding the case ending to this. The superlative is formed by adding -ast- and then the case endings. The comparative case endings are as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	-i	 	-i	 	-a
A	 	-a	 	-i	 	-a
G	 	-a	 	-i	 	-a
D	 	-a	 	-i	 	-a
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	-i	 	-i	 	-i
A	 	-i	 	-i	 	-i
G	 	-i	 	-i	 	-i
D	 	-um	 	-um	 	-um
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Though these endings resemble those of weak adjectives, they are not necessarily definite, so that e.g. ljótari maðr is 'an uglier man'. The comparative of hvass 'sharp' illustrates the paradigm.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hvassari	 	hvassari	 	hvassara
A	 	hvassara	 	hvassari	 	hvassara
G	 	hvassara	 	hvassari	 	hvassara
D	 	hvassara	 	hvassari	 	hvassara
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	hvassari	 	hvassari	 	hvassari
A	 	hvassari	 	hvassari	 	hvassari
G	 	hvassari	 	hvassari	 	hvassari
D	 	hvǫssurum	 	hvǫssurum	 	hvǫssurum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The superlative declines like any other adjective, using the strong adjective endings for indefinite roles, weak endings for definite. For example, strong forms ljótastr (masc. N sg.) 'ugliest', ljótastir (masc. N pl.), ljótust (fem. N sg.), ljótastar (fem. N pl.), ljótast (neut. N sg.), ljótust (neut. N pl.). The declension parallels that of gamal-. Examples of weak forms: inn ljótasti (masc. N sg.) 'the ugliest', inir ljótustu (masc. N pl.), in ljótasta (fem. N sg.), inar ljótustu (fem. N pl.), it ljótasta (neut. N sg.), in ljótustu (neut. N pl.).

Several adjectives are derived by addition of the suffix -lig-. Addition of the comparative ending -ar- often results in syncope: when the a of the ending is unstressed and followed by a single consonant plus vowel, the a is dropped. This obtains in all forms of the comparative. For example, gørviligr 'accomplished' and líkligr 'likely' have the forms gørviligri 'more accomplished' and líkligri 'more likely'. This syncope usually is not found in the superlative, e.g. masc. N sg. líkligastr 'most likely', fem. N sg. gørviligust 'most accomplished'. Some words, however, do show syncope even in the superlative: efniligr 'promising', efniligri 'more promising', efniligstr 'most promising'. Generally disyllabic adjectives drop the a of the comparative and superlative endings.

Several adjectives form the comparative and superlative simply by adding -r- or -st-, respectively, with attendant fronting (i-umlaut) of the stem vowel. The case endings are the same as those for comparatives and superlatives in -ar- and -ast-. For example, langr (stem lang-) 'long' has the comparative lengri (masc. N sg.) and the superlative lengsti (weak masc. N sg.) or lengstr (strong masc. N sg.); ungr (stem ung-) 'young' has yngri and yngsti/yngstr. The adjectives which most commonly form the comparative and superlative in this way are listed below.

Stem	 	Positive	 	Comparative	 	Superlative (weak, strong)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
fá- 'few'	 	fár	 	færi	 	fæsti, fæstr
fagr- 'fair'	 	fagr	 	fegri	 	fegrsti, fegrstr
há- 'high'	 	hár	 	hæri	 	hæsti, hæstr
lág- 'low'	 	lágr	 	lægri	 	lægsti, lægstr
sein- 'late'	 	seinn	 	seinni	 	seinsti, seinstr
skamm- 'short'	 	skammr	 	skemmri	 	skemmsti, skemmstr
smá- 'small'	 	smár	 	smæri	 	smæsti, smæstr
stór- 'big'	 	stór	 	stœri	 	stœrsti, stœrstr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Some adjectives form the comparative and superlative by either method, employing either the suffixes -ar-, -ast- or -r-, -st- (with fronting). For example, djúpr 'deep' forms either djúpari, djúpasti, djúpastr or dýpri, dýpsti, dýpstr; similarly frægr 'famous' forms frægjari, frægjasti, frægjastr or frægri, frægsti, frægstr.

A few adjectives have comparatives and superlatives formed from completely different stems. The most common are listed below.

Positive Stem	 	Comparative Stem	 	Superlative Stem
 	 	 	 	 
góð- 'good'	 	betr-	 	bezt-
ill-, vánd- 'bad'	 	verr-	 	verst-
mikil- 'great'	 	meir-	 	mest-
lítil- 'little'	 	minn-	 	minnst-
marg- 'many'	 	fleir-	 	flest-
gamal- 'old'	 	eldr-, ellr-	 	elzt-
 	 	 	 	 
18 Relatives, Interrogatives, and Indefinites
18.1 Relatives
Old Norse employs the word er, earlier es, as an all-purpose relative particle. It is indeclinable, and can therefore represent any case, gender, and number. Sometimes it is preceded by a form of sá to indicate gender and number, e.g. sú er 'who' (fem. sg.). This form of sá may belong to the relative clause itself, but often it belongs to the preceding clause, so that its case bears no relation to the case represented by er: ...sverð þat er..., depending on context, could represent '(that is) the sword, which (bears his name)' as well as '(that is) the sword, by which (he was killed)', or '(that is) the sword, of which (the legacy is well-known)'. er is also used with demonstrative adverbs or particles to make relatives, e.g. þar 'there' vs. þar er 'where', þá 'then' vs. þá er 'when'. The word sem is often used with the same functions as er, especially in the later texts. There are no separate relative pronouns or adjectives, and, unlike other Indo-European languages, the stem of the interrogative pronoun is not used in this role.

18.2 Interrogatives
The basic interrogative stem is hverj- 'who, which, what', used both as an adjective and as a pronoun. As an adjective it takes strong endings. The paradigm is given below.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hverr	 	hver	 	hvert
A	 	hvern	 	hverja	 	hvert
G	 	hvers	 	hverrar	 	hvers
D	 	hverjum	 	hverri	 	hverju
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	hverir	 	hverjar	 	hver
A	 	hverja	 	hverjar	 	hver
G	 	hverra	 	hverra	 	hverra
D	 	hverjum	 	hverrjum	 	hverrjum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The pronoun sometimes employs the same forms, but alternate forms are quite common. These are listed below.

 	 	Masc./Fem.	 	Neut.
 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	hverr	 	hvat
A	 	hverjan, hvern	 	hvat
G	 	hvers, hves(s)	 	hvers, hves(s)
D	 	hverjum, hveim	 	hví
 	 	 	 	 
The plural is the same as the adjective, with hveim used as a common contraction for the D pl. hverjum.

The pronoun hverj- in the sense 'which (of many)' contrasts with hvár- 'which of two'. hvár- declines as a regular strong adjective, e.g. masc. N sg. hvárr, pl. hvárir; fem. N sg. hvár, pl. hvárar; neut. N sg. hvárt, pl. hvár.

Certain case forms of the interrogative pronouns were frozen and used as interrogative adjectives. The most common are listed below.

Interrog. Adv.	 	Meaning
 	 	 
hvaðan	 	'whence'
hvar	 	'where'
hvert	 	'whither'
hvárt	 	'whether (or not)'
hvé	 	'how'
hvenær	 	'when'
hví	 	'why'
hversu	 	'how'
hvernig	 	'how, by what means'
 	 	 
The negative correlation is expressed with hvárki... né 'neither... nor'.

18.3 Indefinites
For the most part, indefinite pronouns are formed in the same fashion as normal indefinite (i.e. strong) adjectives. Several of the indefinite pronouns, however, have minor peculiarities and differences from strong adjective declension. The most common indefinites are treated below.

all- 'all' follows the regular adjective declension, e.g. masc. N sg. allr, pl. allir; fem. N sg. ǫll, pl. allar; neut. N sg. allt, pl. ǫll.

sum- 'some, (a) certain' follows the regular adjective declension, e.g. masc. N sg. sumr, pl. sumir; fem. N sg. sum, pl. sumar; neut. N sg. sumt, pl. sum.

ein- 'one' as a pronoun is distinguished from the numeral ein- 'one'. As a pronoun it signifies any given indefinite referent, and occurs only in the singular. All of its forms follow the regular strong adjective declension, except the neut. N and A sg. forms eitt (instead of *eint).

annar- '(an) other' has a variant stem aðr- before case endings that begin with a vowel. Contraction yields masc. A sg. annan, and assimilation yields neut. N/A sg. annat. See Section 13.2 for the declension.

nǫkkur- 'any, some; a certain' declines as a regular strong adjective, except for a contracted masc. A sg. form nǫkkurn and neut. N/A sg. nǫkkut. The stem nakkvar- is also used. The declension is as follows.

 	 	Masculine	 	 	 	Feminine	 	 	 	Neuter	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	nakkvarr	 	nǫkkurr	 	nǫkkur	 	 	 	nakkvat	 	nǫkkut
A	 	nakkvarn	 	nǫkkurn	 	nakkvara	 	nǫkkura	 	nakkvat	 	nǫkkut
G	 	nakkvars	 	nǫkkurs	 	nakkvarar	 	nǫkkurar	 	nakkvars	 	nǫkkurs
D	 	nǫkkurum	 	 	 	nakkvarri	 	nǫkkurri	 	nǫkkuru	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	nakkvarir	 	nǫkkurir	 	nakkvarar	 	nǫkkurar	 	nǫkkur	 	 
A	 	nakkvara	 	nǫkkura	 	nakkvarar	 	nǫkkurar	 	nǫkkur	 	 
G	 	nakkvarra	 	nǫkkurra	 	nakkvarra	 	nǫkkurra	 	nakkvarra	 	nǫkkurra
D	 	nǫkkurum	 	 	 	nǫkkurum	 	 	 	nǫkkurum	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
ein- + hverj- 'one, some'. These two stems often combine to form a pronoun. The second member hverj- is always declined; the first member may either remain invariant or be declined along with the second member. For example, masc. G sg. einshvers or einhvers.

19 Present Participle
The present participle is derived by adding the suffix -nd- to the verbal infinitive. The declension follows that of comparative adjectives. Thus þegja 'be silent', þegjandi 'being silent'; hlæja 'laugh', hlæjandi 'laughing'; ganga 'go', gangandi 'walking'. The present participle of sofa 'sleep' serves to illustrate the declension.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	sofandi	 	sofandi	 	sofanda
A	 	sofanda	 	sofandi	 	sofanda
G	 	sofanda	 	sofandi	 	sofanda
D	 	sofanda	 	sofandi	 	sofanda
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	sofandi	 	sofandi	 	sofandi
A	 	sofandi	 	sofandi	 	sofandi
G	 	sofandi	 	sofandi	 	sofandi
D	 	sofǫndum	 	sofǫndum	 	sofǫndum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The participle denotes an action ongoing at the time of the main verb. Its use is much less frequent in ON than its counterpart in Modern English, though for the most part it is able to fill the same roles. It may be used in a simple adjectival role, e.g. logandi brandr 'a burning brand'. The force of the participle can be adverbial, e.g. hon gekk þegjandi 'she went being silent', which has the sense of Modern English 'she went silently.'

Some common nouns are in origin present participles, such as bóndi 'farmer, husband' (= búandi < búa 'dwell, settle') or frændi 'kinsman'. These follow the declension of the nd-stem nouns discussed in Section 11.2.

20 Adjective Use
As already noted, adjectives have strong and weak forms. The strong forms are indefinite, while the weak are definite. A predicate adjective, not used as a substantive, is strong. An attributive adjective is usually strong in poetry, even when prose would use a weak adjective with the definite article. For example: fyrr vil ek kyssa konung ólifþan, en þú blóþogri bryniu kastir 'sooner will I kiss the lifeless king, than you cast off the bloody byrnie'. This use is not confined to poetry alone; examples from prose are not uncommon: með fǫþur sinn gamlan 'with his old father'. Though the possessive sinn serves to make the noun definite, the strong form of the adjective is still used. Even epithets may occasionally use the strong form of the adjective instead of the more common weak form: Eiríkr rauðr 'Erik the Red'. In prose the vocative more often employs the strong form of the adjective: forþa þér, vesall maðr! 'save yourself, unfortunate man!'

Often ON uses a simple adjective where Modern English would use a phrase or some other circumlocution. The adjective usually takes the strong form in such situations, even when used in conjunction with a definite article. Examples are í miðjum hauginum 'in the middle of the hill'; um þueran skálann 'straight across the hall'; ǫndorþan vetr 'the first part of the winter'. Such usage even applies to pronouns, e.g. þeir margir 'many of them'.

Poetry and high-style composition make more frequent use of substantives with indefinite form than does simple prose. For example: blindr er betri, en brendr sé 'a blind (man) is better off than a burned (man) would be'; hvat muntu, ríkr, vinna 'what would you tell, powerful (man)'; rétt 'Right (vs. Wrong)'. Definite adjectives with a definite article are uncommon even in poetry. Their use in prose is mostly confined to names of peoples, e.g. inir ensku 'the English'. These forms are also used with ordered items, e.g. inn yngri, inn ellri 'the younger, the older'.

The weak adjective is found in prose without the definite article in epithets following the name, e.g. Hákon góði 'Hakon the Good'. The same is found with comparatives, superlatives, and ordinals placed before the noun they modify: fyrra sumar 'last summer'; á vinstri hlið 'on the left side'; í næsta hús 'in the next house'; við þriðja mann 'with the third man'.
 	 	 	 	 

Lesson 5
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum

Scandinavian Merchant Culture
Given the exciting narratives in which the tales of Vikings are told by the Scandinavians themselves, and given the overwhelming preoccupation of other parts of Europe with the marauding forces of the Vikings, it is easy to pass over the fact that much of Scandinavian culture relied on merchant trade as a powerful source of goods and wealth. The skin-trade was an important merchant mainstay in the far north, so much so that Harald Fairhair's tribute regulations were cause for dissention in the ranks of local rulers. It seems that furs were traded in England for agricultural commodoties such as honey, wheat, wine, and cloth.

Viking Age trade routes in northwest Europe
An image depicting Viking Age trade routes in and around the Baltic and North seas.  The map marks the location of the trading center at Kaupang, which has been studied by archaeologists.  Perhaps larger and more permanet fixtures on these trade routes were Hedeby in the east and Birka in the west.  Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.
Excavations at Kaupang, near the Oslo Fjord, show evidence of a trade-route market. The market is placed back from the shore of the bay, accessible only by narrow channels which would make ship-borne raids difficult. The back of the market butts up against high mountains, making land-raids also impractical. Between the two is an open plain, suitable for pitching tents for trade. Traders typically did not erect permanent structures at such sites, but rather mounded up turf walls which were covered by a tent when the merchant returned, but were otherwise left open to the elements when unoccupied. Items found in the area surrounding Kaupang include bits of Frankish glass, pottery from the Rhineland, and other objects from the British Isles. Such items might certainly have arrived as the result of raids, but other delicate objects of Celtic origin have been found in Norway in such immaculate condition that their interpretation as war booty is relatively unlikely. From markets such as Kaupang, merchants could also head to Continental Europe with their own goods: iron, feathers and down, and soapstone (used for spindle-whorls, cookery, and molds for casting metal).

Other markets seem to have had a more permanent population, such as at Hedeby, at the base of the Jutland peninsula. This was a town which by the tenth century had a walled rampart enclosing some 60 acres. Inside this were originally long timbered houses, but these gave way to smaller houses roughly 10 feet square, built along wooden roads, each with a fenced-in courtyard and a well. People lived there year-round, and not only Scandinavians, since Frisian and Saxon graves are found there as well. A rather large population of craftsmen allowed the town to be inhabited all year long, when seasonal crops or hunting were impracticable. Artefacts pertaining to the crafts of glass-making and metal-working outweigh those of agricultural pursuits, so that basic nutritional commodities appear to have been imported from elsewhere.

Depiction of a Viking raid by Olaf Tryggvason
Artistic rendering of a Viking raid led by Olaf Tryggvason.  Wood engraving by Hugo Vogel in the book Great Men and Famous Women, by Charles F. Horne (1894).
The Vikings, however, had their marauding reputation for a reason, and this infected their merchant activities in the form of a lively slave trade. There was a large demand for slaves in the Arab cultures populating the Mediterranean from Spain to the Holy Land, which Scandinavians happily supplied. The Christianizing of Central Europe made this more difficult as the church tried to prevent Christian slaves from being owned by Muslims. The Scandinavians were forced to look farther east to supply their market, and the heathen Slavs were a ready source which Christians would allow to pass through their territories uninterrupted. Some of the trade passed directly to the Black Sea through the rivers of the Russian territory, but some made its way west through Hedeby, down through France, and into Spain. The Danes and Norwegians, for their part, continued to cull slaves from the British Isles, but being Christian they were difficult to sell and usually the Danes and Norwegians themselves kept them as servants.

A 30 acre Swedish settlement at Birka along the Gulf of Finland is referenced as early as 870 as a hub for trade routes leading down the Dnieper and Volga rivers into Russian territory. These trade routes led to rich hunting grounds supplying the fur trade. Arab accounts refer to the Rus as traders dealing in the skins of beavers and foxes, and in swords.  Though these Arab accounts make little distinction between Slav and Scandinavian, records of the Eastern Slavs derive the name Rus from the original Scandinavian tribe of the founding Russian dynasty. The primary towns which arose along the Dnieper were Smolensk, Chernigov, and Kyiv (Kiev). The rulers of these settlements were Scandinavian in origin, though it is not clear what the relative populations were between Scandinavian and Slav. These eastern trade routes were the arteries for a flow of silver coins back to Sweden, Arab coins found so far numbering in the tens of thousands, Byzantine coins in the hundreds. As the Middle Eastern silver mines were depleted, the Scandinavian silver trade shifted to Germany.

Introduction to the Reading
The author of Egils saga is not known for certain. Some have suspected Snorri Sturluson wrote the tale, arguing mainly on elements of compositional style, and noting that Snorri in fact lived for a brief time at Egil's old home in the western reaches of Iceland. The saga as we have it is preserved in several different documents, the most extensive being one copy in a collection of other Icelandic sagas dating to the fourteenth century, as well as two other defective manuscripts of roughly similar date. There is a paper fragment containing part of the story which dates to the middle of the thirteenth century.

The saga tells of Egil Skallagrímson, a historical figure with a knack for adventure and raucous behaviour. His drinking exploits led to a long-lasting blood-feud when a steward of Eirík Blóðøx tried to poison Egil because he was drinking up the store of ale. Egil killed the steward, and on a later journey sued one of Eirík's friends. Egil was driven away by Eirík's men, and in retaliation Egil killed the man he sued, as well as one of Eirík's sons.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following passage is an excerpt from Egil's travels to York. Egil does not initially know that Eirík has become king of the region. When Egil's boat is wrecked, he loses hope of escaping the region unnoticed, and instead decides to confront Eirík. Egil first approaches Arinbjǫrn, one of Eirík's retainers, and someone who is kindly disposed toward Egil. Arinbjǫrn acts as Egil's advocate, leading Egil into the king's presence and speaking on his behalf. Upon convincing the king to hold off till morning the decision of any action to be taken against Egil, Arinbjǫrn counsels Egil to compose a poem to please the king, in hopes that artistic savvy will ultimately win him good favor. That night, Egil goes off by himself to compose the poem, but when Arinbjǫrn later checks Egil's progress, Egil complains that he has accomplished nothing because a noisy bird perched on his window and broke his concentration. Arinbjǫrn thus sits the night through keeping watch on Egil's window, and Egil brings his finished result to Eirík's court the following morning. In court several of Eirík's retainers argue for killing Egil, and Eirík's queen Gunnhild argues against them in favor of Egil. The following passage picks up at the end of this discussion.

 Þá segir Arinbjǫrn, "Ef þú, konungr, ok þit Gunnhildr hafið þat einráðit, at Egill skal hér enga sætt fá, þá er þat drengskapr, at gefa honum frest ok fararleyfi um viku sakar, at hann forði sér, þó hefir hann at sjálfvilja sínum farit hingat á fund yðvarn, ok vænti sér at því friðar. Fara þá enn skipti yður, sem verða má þaðan frá."

Lesson Text
Þá segir Arinbjǫrn, "Ef þú, konungr, ok þit Gunnhildr hafið þat einráðit, at Egill skal hér enga sætt fá, þá er þat drengskapr, at gefa honum frest ok fararleyfi um viku sakar, at hann forði sér, þó hefir hann at sjálfvilja sínum farit hingat á fund yðvarn, ok vænti sér at því friðar. Fara þá enn skipti yður, sem verða má þaðan frá."

Gunnhildr mælti: "Sjá kann ek á þessu, Arinbjǫrn, at þú ert hollari Agli en Eiríki konungi. Ef Egill skal ríða heðan viku í brott í friði, þá mun hann kominn til Aðalsteins konungs á þessi stundu. En Eiríkr konungr þarf nú ekki at dyljask í því, at honum verða nú allir konungar ofreflismenn, en fyrir skǫmmu mundi þat ekki glíkligt, at Eiríkr konungr mundi eigi hafa til þess vilja ok atferð, at hefna harma sinna á hverjum manni slíkum sem Egill er."

Arinbjǫrn segir, "Engi maðr mun Eirík kalla at meira mann, þó at hann drepi einn bóndason útlendan, þann er gengit hefir á vald hans. En ef hann vill miklask at þessu, þá skal ek þat veita honum, at þessi tíðindi skulu heldr þykkja frásagnarverð, því at vit Egill munum nú veitask at, svá at jafnsnimma skal okkr mœta báðum. Muntu, konungr, þá dýrt kaupa líf Egils, um þat er vér erum allir at velli lagðir, ek ok sveitungar mínir; mundi mik annars vara at yðr, en þú mundir mik vilja leggja heldr at jǫrðu en láta mik þiggja líf eins manns er ek bið."

Þá segir konungr, "Allmikit kapp leggr þú á þetta, Arinbjǫrn, at veita Agli lið. Trauðr mun ek til vera, at gøra þér skaða, ef því er at skipta, ef þú vill heldr leggja fram líf þitt en hann sé drepinn. En œrnar eru sakar til við Egil, hvat sem ek læt gøra við hann."

Ok er konungr hafði þetta mælt, þá gekk Egill fyrir hann ok hóf upp kvæðit ok kvað hátt ok fekk þegar hljóð:

Translation
Then Arinbjorn says, 'If you, king, and you Gunnhild have decided that Egil should get no settlement here, then nobility demands giving him respite and leave to depart for a week, so that he save himself, since he has travelled here of his own accord to meet you, and should on this account expect peaceful intentions toward himself. Your dealings go the same way as it might turn out later.
Gunnhild said, 'I can see this, Arinbjorn, that you are more loyal to Egil than to King Eirik. If Egil should ride from here for a week in peace, then he might reach King Athalstan in that time. King Eirik need not deceive himself in this, that now all the kings have become more powerful than him; yet a short time ago that would not have been likely, that King Eirik should not have the desire or energy for this, to avenge his grievances on each man such as Egil is.'
Arinbjorn said, 'No man would call Eirik a greater man if he should kill a foreign farmer's son, who has come under his control. But if he wants to acquire fame from this, then I should assist him in this, so that these events will seem more worth telling, by the fact that Egil and I will now help each other, so that he shall deal equally with us both. You might, king, pay dearly for Egil's life, when we are all laid low, I and my followers; I would have expected different from you, than that you would be more willing to lay me on the ground than let me receive the life of one man which I request.'
Then the king says, 'You take great pains in this, Arinbjorn, to give Egil assistance. Reluctant might I be to do you harm, if it comes to that, if you would rather set aside your life than that he be killed. But there are sufficient causes against Egil, whatever I order to be done with him.'
And as the king had said that, Egil went before him and took up his poem and spoke loud and commanded silence:
Westward I rode out over the sea, and I bear the sea
of Odin's breast, as was my condition;
I dragged the oak afloat during the ice-breaking,
I loaded my mind's hold with a cargo of praise.
I offered myself to the king with hospitality, I have the duty of praise,
I bear Odin's mead to the lands of the Angles.
I have accomplished the prince's praise, certainly I should praise him,
I ask him for audience, since I have composed his praise.
Consider this, king, well would you do,
how I start to recite, if I obtain silence.
Many a man has heard what fights the king has fought,
and Odin saw where the slain lay.
The din grew of swords against the shield's rim,
the battle waxed round the king, the king pressed onward:
there was heard the prophecy of the metal-storm,
the sword's stream flowed, where it lay strongest.
[N.B. . In the end, Egil's poem wins him his life.]
Grammar
21 Distributive and Negative Pronouns and Adjectives
21.1 Distributives
As already mentioned, the pronoun hverj- in the sense 'which (of many)' is distinct from hvár- 'which of two'. hverj- declines as in Section 18.2, while hvár- follows the normal declension of regular strong adjectives, e.g. masc. N sg. hvárr, pl. hvárir; fem. N sg. hvár, pl. hvárar; neut. N sg. hvárt, pl. hvár.

hvár(r)tveggja 'each of two' is clearly a collocation involving hvár- mentioned above and tveggja, G pl. of tveir 'two'. As such, the first element is always declined like hvárr. The second element is usually left unchanged, but sometimes takes the endings of the feminine weak adjective.

hverj- 'each, every' is declined like a regular strong adjective, except for the contracted masc. A sg. hvern. Thus masc. N sg. hverr, pl. hverir; fem. N sg. hver, pl. hverjar; neut. N sg. hvert, pl. hver.

báð- 'both' occurs only in the plural. Note the peculiar neuter forms, and the G pl. form, in the following paradigm.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	báðir	 	báðar	 	bæði
A	 	báða	 	báðar	 	bæði
G	 	beggja	 	beggja	 	beggja
D	 	báðum	 	báðum	 	báðum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
21.2 Negatives
Old Norse has a number of negative pronouns and adjectives, many of which are compounds of an indefinite pronoun or adjective with some particle or word conveying negative force. Only two are particularly common, nein- and engi-, and of these engi- is by far the most prevalent.

nein- 'none, not any' is declined like ein-, so that all of its forms follow the regular strong adjective declension, except the neut. N and A sg. forms neitt (instead of *neint). It also has plural forms which follow regular strong adjective declension.

engi- 'no, none' is a combination of ein 'one' and the particle gi. The coalescence of the two leads to several irregular forms.

 	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	engi	 	engi	 	ekki
A	 	engan, engi	 	enga	 	ekki
G	 	einskis, engis	 	engrar	 	einskis, engis
D	 	engum	 	engri	 	engu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	engir	 	engar	 	engi
A	 	enga	 	engar	 	engi
G	 	engra	 	engra	 	engra
D	 	engum	 	engum	 	engum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Other less common forms have the stem eing- or øng-. Sometimes -v- is present before endings beginning with an a, e.g. fem. N / A pl. øngvar, engvar; and before the masc. N pl. ending -ir, e.g. øngvir, engvir.

22 Numerals
22.1 Cardinals and Ordinals
Below is a list of the cardinal and ordinal numerals in Old Norse.

Number	 	Cardinal	 	Ordinal
 	 	 	 	 
1	 	einn	 	fyrstr
2	 	tveir	 	annarr

30	 	þrír tigir	 	þrítugandi
31	 	þrír tigir ok einn	 	þrítugandi ok fyrstr
40	 	fjórir tigir	 	fertugandi
50	 	fimm tigir	 	fimmtugandi
60	 	sex tigir	 	sextugandi
70	 	sjau tigir	 	sjautugandi
80	 	átta tigir	 	áttatugandi
90	 	níu tigir	 	nítugandi
100	 	tíu tigir	 	(títugandi)
110	 	ellifu tigir	 	(ellifutugandi)
120	 	hundrað	 	(hundraðasti)
200	 	hundrað ok átta tigir	 	(hundraðasti ok áttatugandi)
240	 	tvau hundrað	 	 
960	 	átta hundrað	 	 
1200	 	þúsund	 	(þúsandasti)
The ordinals in parentheses are not recorded in ON texts. The forms given are supplied from Modern Icelandic. The ending -andi is often written -undi in ON texts.

Although the above list shows the most common usage, hundrað and þúsund are occasionally used as in Modern English, i.e. hundrað = 100 and þúsand = 1000. One must determine from context which meaning is intended. Often the exact numerical value of such large numbers was rather unimportant to the writer or speaker.

The form tigir which appears in the cardinal decades is the nominative plural of the masculine noun tigr 'group of ten, decade' (also written tegr, tugr, tøgr, stem tig-u-). hundrað is a neuter noun, þúsund feminine.

22.2 Numeral Declension
The cardinal numbers one through four are declined as adjectives, agreeing with the modified noun in gender, number, and case. ein- occurs in the singular and plural. In the plural the meaning is akin to 'only, alone'. The cardinals 2, 3, 4 occur only in the plural. The declensions are given below.

ein- 'one'	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Sg.	 	einn	 	ein	 	eitt
A	 	einn	 	eina	 	eitt
G	 	eins	 	einnar	 	eins
D	 	einum	 	einni	 	einu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	einir	 	einar	 	ein
A	 	eina	 	einar	 	ein
G	 	einna	 	einna	 	einna
D	 	einum	 	einum	 	einum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
tveir 'two'	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	tveir	 	tvær	 	tvau
A	 	tvá	 	tvær	 	tvau
G	 	tveggja	 	tveggja	 	tveggja
D	 	tveim(r)	 	tveim(r)	 	tveim(r)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
þrí- 'three'	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	þrír	 	þrjár	 	þrjú
A	 	þrjá	 	þrjár	 	þrjú
G	 	þriggja	 	þriggja	 	þriggja
D	 	þrim(r)	 	þrim(r)	 	þrim(r)
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
fjór- 'four'	 	Masculine	 	Feminine	 	Neuter
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
N Pl.	 	fjórir	 	fjórar	 	fjǫgur
A	 	fjóra	 	fjórar	 	fjǫgur
G	 	fjǫgurra	 	fjǫgurra	 	fjǫgurra
D	 	fjórum	 	fjórum	 	fjórum
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The cardinal numbers 5 through 20 are uninflected. As mentioned in the preceding section, tigr is declined as a strong masculine noun, hundrað as a strong neuter, and þúsund as a strong feminine.

The ordinal numbers one through four are also declined as adjectives. fyrst- 'first' declines as both strong and weak adjective, all genders, singular and plural. For example, masc. N sg. fyrsti (weak), fyrstr (strong); masc. N pl. fyrstu (weak), fyrstir (strong). The cardinal annar- 'second' is declined exactly as the pronoun 'other'. þriðj- 'third' is only declined as a weak adjective. For example, N sg. masc. þriði, fem./neut. þriðja; N pl. all genders þriðju. fjórð- 'fourth' is also declined only as a weak adjective: N sg. masc. fjórði, fem./neut. fjórða; N pl. all genders fjórðu.

The remaining ordinals, such as fimmti, sétti, ..., tuttugandi, ..., all declined as weak adjectives, matching the referent in gender, case, and number.

23 The First Strong Conjugation
Each strong verb conjugation in ON is characterized by a specific ablaut pattern, which is the remnant of historical sound changes that affected a group of verbs in a similar fashion. The first strong conjugation is characterized by the following pattern:

 	 	í -- ei -- i,e from Proto-Germanic ī -- ai -- i.
The first vowel is characteristic of present forms, the second of past singular forms, the third of past plural forms. These vowels are subject to further change depending on the environment in which they occur within the verbal paradigm (see Lesson 1 for a more detailed discussion of ablaut and the principal parts of strong verbs).

Verbs of Class I whose stem ends with g sometimes show variant forms for the 1st and 3rd person singular of the past tense. The g often drops and the vowel changes, e.g. stíga 'step' gives steig or sté, hníga 'fall' gives either hneig or hné. The verb bíða 'abide' has past participle beðinn instead of the expected biðinn.

The verb bíta 'bite', with prinicpal parts bíta -- bítr -- beit -- bitu -- biti -- bitinn, serves to illustrate the forms of the first conjugation. The active forms are as follows.

Class I	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	bít	 	bíta	 	 
2	 	bítr	 	bítir	 	bít
3	 	bítr	 	bíti	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	bítum	 	bítim	 	bítum
2	 	bítið	 	bítið	 	bítið
3	 	bíta	 	bíti	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	beit	 	bita	 	 
2	 	beizt	 	bitir	 	 
3	 	beit	 	biti	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	bitum	 	bitim	 	 
2	 	bituð	 	bitið	 	 
3	 	bitu	 	biti	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infinitive	 	bíta	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	bítandi	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	bitinn	 	 	 	 
The middle forms are listed below.

Class I	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	bítumk	 	bítumk	 	 
2	 	bízk	 	bítisk	 	bízk
3	 	bízk	 	bítisk	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	bítumsk	 	bítimsk	 	bítumsk
2	 	bítizk	 	bítizk	 	bítizk
3	 	bítask	 	bítisk	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	bitumk	 	bitumk	 	 
2	 	beizk	 	bitisk	 	 
3	 	beizk	 	bitisk	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	bitumsk	 	bitimsk	 	 
2	 	bituzk	 	bitizk	 	 
3	 	bitusk	 	bitisk	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Infinitive	 	bítask	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Pres. Ptc.	 	bítandisk	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	bitizk	 	 	 	 
Note the appearance of the form beizt. In general, strong verbs with stems ending in -t take the second person singular active ending -st rather than the simple -t. The resulting combination -t-st simplifies to -zt.

24 The Second Strong Conjugation
The second strong conjugation comprises verbs whose present system often shows the diphthong jú. The ablaut series is as follows.

 	 	jú, jó -- au -- u, o; ú from Proto-Germanic eu -- au -- u, ū.
When the consonant following the root vowel is a dental (ð, d, s, t), jú is realized as jó. For example, brjóta 'break', ljósta 'smite', skjóta 'shoot', bjóða 'offer', þrjóta 'come to an end', kjósa 'choose'. As with all strong verbs, the root vowel is fronted in the present tense singular; for Class II verbs in particular, this means jú, jó becomes ý.

As in Class I, stem-final g may be dropped in verbs of Class II. For example, fljúga 'fly', with stem fljúg- has alternate stems fló- and flaug- in the past tense singular. Similarly, smjúg- 'creep' has smó- and smaug-. Thus ek fló or ek flaug, þú flótt or þú flaugt. The alternation apparently arises from stem variation at an earlier period, in which the final consonant was h in past singular. A similar alternation between the phonemes /s/ and /z/ led to variant forms in verbs ending in sibilants. For example frjósa 'freeze', with stem frjús-, has the variant stem frør- in the past singular; similarly kjósa 'choose' (stem kjús-) has variant kór-.

Three verbs of Class II -- lúka 'finish', súpa 'sip', lúta 'bow' -- show no j in the present system.

The verb skjóta 'shoot', with principal parts skjóta -- skýtr -- skaut -- skutu -- skyti -- skotinn, illustrates the conjugation. The active forms are as follows.

Class II	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	skýt	 	skjóta	 	 
2	 	skýtr	 	skjótir	 	skjót

The middle forms are listed below.

Class II	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative

Past Ptc.	 	skotizk	 	 	 	 
Note again the ending -st in the second person singular active and the accompanying sound change resulting in -zt.

25 Adverbs
25.1 General
Old Norse employs a few different mechanisms for deriving adverbs. The most common are listed below.

Neuter accusative singular. The neuter accusative singular of adjectives is used in an adverbial role. For example, mikit 'much, greatly'; lágt 'low, softly'; sárt 'sorely'; allt 'all the way'; hátt 'loudly, out loud'.

Suffix -a. The suffix -a is used to form adverbs from adjectives, e.g. illa 'badly'. This is commonly used with adjectives derived by means of the suffix -lig-, e.g. ferliga 'hideously', harðliga 'fiercely', varliga 'scarcely'. Such forms are often shortened, e.g. harðla, varla.

Other cases. Other cases of nouns and adjectives are occasionally used in an adverbial sense.

Accusative: megin 'side(s)' < vegr 'way';
Genitive: alls 'of all, at all'; stundar 'very, quite';
Dative: miklu 'much, by far'; stórum 'hugely'; næstum 'the last time'; stundum 'sometimes'.
25.2 Negation and Affirmation
Adverbs corresponding to Modern English yes and no are ON já and nei. The intensive particle -gi often forms a negative, e.g. eigi 'not'; engi 'no, not any'; hvergi 'nowhere, not at all'; aldri 'never' < aldregi. eigi and ekki correspond to Modern English 'not' used with verbs. Poetry frequently employs -a, -at, and -gi as enclitic negative suffixes, e.g. vas-k-a = var ek -a 'I was not'. né is occasionally used in conjunction with these enclitics: sofa né má-k-at 'I cannot sleep'.

25.3 Local
A few suffixes are used to denote specific types or directions of motion. These are listed below.

Suffix -i. Used to denote stationary location. Thus inn 'into' vs. inni 'inside, within'.

Suffix -an. Used to denote motion from a place. Thus innan 'from within'.

Suffix -gat. Used to denote motion toward a place, e.g. hingat 'to here' < hinn veg at, þangat 'to there'.

Suffix -nig. Used to denote motion toward a place, e.g. hinnig 'to here'.

The adverb fyrir 'before, in front' is commonly used in the following type of construction:

 	 	fyrir + (adv.)-an + acc. 'off, along, near', e.g. fyrir austan land 'along the east coast'.
Adverbs such as austan are often used with the genitive to denote 'east of', and the like.

25.4 Comparison
Comparative and superlative adverbs are often formed in a regular way from the corresponding adjectives. The neuter accusative may be used, so that optar and optast are comparative and superlative of opt 'often'. The suffix -a is also common, so that hvassara and hvassast are comparative and superlative of hvast 'keenly'. The procedure also applies to adjectives employing the comparative suffix -r and superlative -st, with fronting of the root vowel: langt/lengi 'long', comp. lengr(a), sup. lengst. As with adjectives, some adverbs have a suppletive system of comparison. The most common forms are listed below.

Positive	 	Comparative	 	Superlative
 	 	 	 	 
lítt 'little'	 	minnr, miðr	 	minst
mjǫk 'much'	 	meir(r)	 	mest
vel 'well'	 	betr	 	bezt
illa 'badly'	 	verr	 	verst
gjarna 'willingly'	 	heldr	 	helzt

Viking Skills
Though ostensibly ruffians from the viewpoint of those they invaded, the Vikings nevertheless had a more cultured and refined aspect to their way of life when at home. When we consider the volume of Old Norse literature, it becomes clear that their culture highly prized, if not writing itself, at least stories artistically wrought and poetry of great complexity. But from the stories themselves we find other skills and amusements which were highly esteemed. A passage from Earl Rognvald of the Orkneys (1135-58) lists them clearly:

 	 	"There are nine skills known to me --
 	 	At 'tables' I play ably;
 	 	Rarely I run out of runes;
 	 	Reading, smith-craft, both come ready;
 	 	I can skim the ground on skis,
 	 	Wield a bow, do well in rowing;
 	 	To both arts I can bend my mind:
 	 	Poet's lay and harper's playing."
 	 	(trans. Jacqueline Simpson)
It is not altogether clear what is meant by 'tables'. Some render the term 'draughts', but this game probably came to Europe later than would be fitting for many of the references in Old Norse literature. The term was likely a catch-all for several different games, many of which seem to have specific names in Old Norse formed as compound words. Game pieces are found in many Scandinavian graves, but it is rarely clear if the set is complete, and, if so, how it was used. One game board found in Balinderry consists of a seven by seven array of holes in which bone pegs were placed.

Runestone at Ockelbo likely depicting a boardgame
The runestone GS 19 from Ocklebo, Sweden.  The center left of the imagery shows two individuals apparently sitting and playing a boardgame.  The image comes from Sveriges runinskrifter, Bd 15:1 Gästriklands runinskrifter (1981, S. B. F. Jansson), citing a reconstruction of the monument (destroyed by fire in 1904) based on earlier drawings and early photographs.
 

The topic of 'runes' inevitably leads to great mystery and speculation. In many contexts, this seems to be a natural result of a deliberate veil of secrecy on the part of the Scandinavians, since the runes were intimately bound with magical rituals of various sorts. But not always. The earliest runic inscriptions in the Germanic speaking community employed an alphabet of some 24 characters, but later this was reduced to 16. Their origin is typically ascribed to divine intervention, as is true of writing in many cultures -- in Norse culture authority is ascribed to Odin. Rognvald's phrasing suggests that 'runes' be interpreted as 'spell', so that his implication is that he knows a wealth of incantations of all sorts. But a more strictly utilitarian interpretation is possible, since by that time runes were used in more pedestrian situations. Often runes were employed for burial inscriptions, or even for marks of ownership such as 'this belongs to...'. In this sense, Rognvald's statement may merely refer to knowledge of the alphabet.

It is telling, nevertheless, that 'reading' is not equated with runes. This comes as no surprise, since we find no sagas or the like etched out in runes. But it lends credence to the idea that 'runes' is better understood as 'spells', since 'reading' itself implies 'knowing an alphabet' (of whatever sort). (See Lesson 10 for more about runes.)

'Smith-craft' properly includes a whole host of skills, and it is not clear if Rognvald meant any one in particular. Excavations show clear remnants of metal-working, wood-carving, carpentry, and bone-carving, among others. The most finely wrought examples certainly would have been made by professional craftsmen, but especially those relating to carving readily available materials such as wood or bone could be expected to be practiced by the non-professional with some high degree of skill. Metal weapons with intricately carved designs are a common reference in the earliest Germanic literature, highly valued and often magically created. But intricate designs are also found in the woodwork of homes, on roof-posts and wall panels. Several picture-stones in Gotland contain figures carved in relief, with background and foreground originally painted in various colors.

Skiing, archery, and rowing. Certainly there is no surprise when such physical prowess is listed among the essential skills of Scandinavian culture. One wonders why these in particular were singled out by Rognvald, when certainly other physical contests were also popular. Wrestling was a common sport, evidently practiced at times in a fairly brutal fashion if we are to take anything from the story of two wrestlers who heartily thanked Grettir for the bloody beating they received at his hands. One may suspect, however, that a skill such as archery, though originally cultivated for deadly results, may have been elevated above such a utilitarian purpose and its more exacting nuances deemed an esoteric skill worthy of devoted practice. Similar ideas about archery are found in cultures of the Far East. Perhaps skiing and rowing were held in a similar regard.

Fortunately poetry and recitation were skills of extreme importance in Scandinavian culture. Were they not, this series of lessons would be quite a bit thinner. Early on, and apparently throughout Scandinavian culture, poetic composition and recitation was a professional occupation, the purview of skálds, or 'court poets'. Remnants of this era are presevered in quotes scattered throughout the literature. But as the heyday of the court poet was nearing its end, Snorri produced the Skáldskaparmál, or 'Treatise on Poetic Composition'. This work gives a detailed description of the technical principles underlying skaldic poetry, and it can be stated with little exaggeration that this literature was among the most complex achieved anywhere in Europe. What is more, Snorri adds a wealth of pertinent mythological information, since by this time, the poetic skill had become so ornate that the allusions made were often confusing or unknown to the listener of Snorri's time. The skalds had cultivated a penchant for 'kennings', whereby a sentiment such as 'the generous king gave me a gold arm-ring' was conveyed by 'the scatterer of riches hung the burden of Grani upon the falcon's tree'. The intended meaning only becomes clear if one knows that Sigurd's horse Grani toted gold from a dragon's lair, and that the 'falcon's tree' is a man's forearm, where the falcon comes to rest.

Poetry by Snorri's time, however, was not solely meant for professionals. Noblemen often displayed an affinity for composing verse, all the more interesting because some of the instances occur on the battlefield. The verses might encapsulate a boast, or even a prediction of doom. And as in the story of Egil, it is clear that a well-composed poem eloquently delivered at the right moment might just save your neck.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following selection comes from Hrólfs saga, which dates to some time in the late 14th century. The saga contains remnants of the legend of the Skjǫldungs, known as the Scyldings in the epic Beowulf. Their story is not told in the poetic style of Beowulf, but rather in a much more direct and viscerally entertaining narrative style. Emphasis is placed on amusing anecdote, rather than on the pan-Germanic theme of tragic heroism. The episode of Bǫðvarr Bjarki at the Danish court is linked by many researchers to the story of Beowulf at Hrothgar's court. In each story the hero arrives to rid the court of the beast which has been ravaging the land.

In the passage below, Bǫðvarr comes to Hrólf's court after staying with a peasant couple living in the area. The couple tells of their son, Hǫttr, who is up at the court and has been continually harassed by Hrólf's retainers. They have taken up the habit of throwing bones at the poor youth. The peasant couple asks that, in return for their hospitality, Bǫðvarr should only throw small bones at their son, so as not to excessively hurt the boy.

The present tense is used throughout the Old Norse passage to lend dramatic effect to the narrative. Old Norse tolerates this sort of historical present much more than Modern English. The translation therefore usually renders present tense verbs by past tenses, though the English present is employed in certain situations where it seems natural.

Lesson Text
Síðan fór Bǫðvarr leið sína til Hleiðargarðs. hann kømr til konungs atsetu. Bǫðvarr leiðir síðan hest sinn á stall hjá konungs hestum hinum beztu ok spyrr engan at; gekk síðan inn í hǫllina, ok var þar fátt manna. Hann sezk útarliga, ok sem hann hefir verit þar lítla hríð, heyrir hann þrausk nǫkkut útar í hornit í einhverjum stað. Bǫðvarr lítr þangat ok sér at mannshǫnd kømr upp ór mikilli beinahrúgu, er þar lá; hǫndin var svǫrt mjǫk. Bǫðvarr gengr þangat til ok spyrr hverr þar væri í beinahrúgunni. Þá var honum svarat ok heldr óframliga: "Hǫttr heiti ek, bokki sæll." "Hví ertu hér", segir Bǫðvarr, "eða hvat gørir þú?" Hǫttr segir, "Ek gøri mér skjaldborg, bokki sæll." Bǫðvarr sagði, "Vesall ertu þinnar skjaldborgar!" Bǫðvarr þrífir til hans ok hnykkir honum upp ór beinahrúgunni. Hǫttr kvað þá hátt við ok mælti, "Nú viltu mér bana! Gør eigi þetta, svá sem ek hefi nú vel um búizk áðr, en þú hefir nú rótat í sundr skjaldborg minni, ok hafða ek nú svá gǫrt hana háva útan at mér, at hon hefir hlíft mér við ǫllum hǫggum ykkar, svá at engi hǫgg hafa komit á mik lengi, en ekki var hon enn svá búin sem ek ætlaði hon skyldi verða." Bǫðvarr mælti: "Ekki muntu fá skjaldborgina lengr." Hǫttr mælti ok grét: "Skaltu nú bana mér, bokki sæll?" Bǫðvarr bað hann ekki hafa hátt, tók hann upp síðan ok bar hann út ór hǫllinni ok til vatns nǫkkurs sem þar var í nánd, ok gáfu fáir at þessu gaum, ok þó hann upp allan.

Síðan gekk Bǫðvarr til þess rúms sem hann hafði áðr tekit, ok leiddi eptir sér Hǫtt ok þar setr hann Hǫtt hjá sér. En hann er svá hræddr at skelfr á honum leggr ok liðr, en þó þykkisk hann skilja at þessi maðr vill hjálpa sér. Eptir þat kveldar ok drífa menn í hǫllina ok sjá Hrólfs kappar at Hǫttr er settr á bekk upp, ok þykkir þeim sá maðr hafa gǫrt sik œrit djarfan, er þetta hefir til tekit. Ilt tillit hefir Hǫttr, þá er hann sér kunningja sína, því at hann hefir ilt eitt at þeim reynt; hann vill lifa gjarnan ok fara aptr í beinahrúgu sína, en Bǫðvarr heldr honum, svá at hann náir ekki í brottu at fara, því at hann þóttisk ekki jafnberr fyrir hǫggum þeira, ef hann næði þangat at komask, sem hann er nú. Hirðmenn hafa nú sama vanda, ok kasta fyrst beinum smám um þvert gólfit til Bǫðvars ok Hattar. Bǫðvarr lætr sem hann sjái eigi þetta. Hǫttr er svá hræddr at hann tekr eigi mat né drykk, ok þykkir honum þá ok þá sem hann muni vera lostinn. Ok nú mælti Hǫttr til Bǫðvars: "Bokki sæll, nú ferr at þér stór knúta, ok mun þetta ætlat okkr til nauða." Bǫðvarr bað hann þegja. Hann setr við holan lófann ok tekr svá við knútunni; þar fylgir leggrinn með. Bǫðvarr sendi aptr knútuna ok setr á þann sem kastaði, ok rétt framan í hann með svá harðri svipan at hann fekk bana. Sló þá miklum ótta yfir hirðmennina.

Kømr nú þessi fregn fyrir Hrólf konung ok kappa hans upp í kastalann, at maðr mikilúðligr sé kominn til hallarinnar ok hafi drepit einn hirðmann hans, ok vildu þeir láta drepa manninn. Hrólfr konungr spurðisk eptir, hvárt hirðmaðrinn hefði verit saklauss drepinn. "Því var næsta", sǫgðu þeir. Kómusk þá fyrir Hrólf konung ǫll sannindi hér um. Hrólfr konungr sagði þat skyldu fjarri, at drepa skyldi manninn -- "hafi þit hér illan vanda upp tekit, at berja saklausa menn beinum; er mér í því óvirðing, en yðr stór skǫmm, at gøra slíkt. Hefi ek jafnan rœtt um þetta áðr, ok hafi þit at þessu engan gaum gefit, ok hygg ek at þessi maðr muni ekki alllítill fyrir sér, er þér hafið nú á leitat; ok kallið hann til mín, svá at ek viti hverr hann er."

Bǫðvarr gengr fyrir konung ok kveðr hann kurteisliga. Konungr spyrr hann at nafni. "Hattargriða kalla mik hirðmenn yðar, en Bǫðvarr heiti ek." Konungr mælti, "Hverjar bœtr viltu bjóða mér fyrir hirðmann minn?" Bǫðvarr segir, "Til þess gørði hann, sem hann fekk." Konungr mælti, "Viltu vera minn maðr ok skipa rúm hans?" Bǫðvarr segir, "Ekki neita ek at vera yðarr maðr, ok munu vit ekki skiljask svá búit, vit Hǫttr, ok dveljask nær þér báðir, heldr en þessi hefir setit; elligar vit fǫrum brott báðir." Konungr mælti, "Eigi sé ek at honum sœmd, en ek spara ekki mat við hann."

Bǫðvarr gengr nú til þess rúms sem honum líkaði, en ekki vill hann þat skipa sem hinn hafði áðr. Hann kippir upp í einhverjum stað þremr mǫnnum, ok síðan settusk þeir Hǫttr þar niðr ok innar í hǫllinni en þeim var skipat. Heldr þótti mǫnnum ódælt við Bǫðvar, ok er þeim hinn mesti íhugi at honum.

Ok sem leið at jólum, gørðusk menn ókátir. Bǫðvarr spyrr Hǫtt hverju þetta sætti; hann segir honum at dýr eitt hafi þar komit tvá vetr í samt, mikit ok ógurligt -- "ok hefir vængi á bakinu ok flýgr þat jafnan. Tvau haust hefir þat nú hingat vitjat ok gǫrt mikinn skaða. Á þat bíta ekki vápn, en kappar konungs koma ekki heim, þeir sem at eru einna mestir." Bǫðvarr mælti, "Ekki er hǫllin svá vel skipuð sem ek ætlaði, ef eitt dýr skal hér eyða ríki ok fé konungsins." Hǫttr sagði, "Þat er ekki dýr, heldr er þat hit mesta trǫll."

Nú kømr jóla-aptann. Þá mælti konungr, "Nú vil ek at menn sé kyrrir ok hljóðir í nótt, ok banna ek ǫllum mínum mǫnnum at ganga í nǫkkurn háska við dýrit, en fé ferr eptir því sem auðnar; menn mína vil ek ekki missa." Allir heita hér góðu um, at gøra eptir því sem konungr bauð.

Bǫðvarr leyndisk í brott um nóttina; hann lætr Hǫtt fara með sér, ok gørir hann þat nauðugr ok kallaði hann sér stýrt til bana. Bǫðvarr segir at betr mundi til takask. Þeir ganga í brott frá hǫllinni, ok verðr Bǫðvarr at bera hann, svá er hann hræddr. Nú sjá þeir dýrit, ok því næst œpir Hǫttr slíkt sem hann má ok kvað dýrit mundu gleypa hann. Bǫðvarr bað bikkjuna hans þegja ok kastar honum niðr í mosann, ok þar liggr hann ok eigi með ǫllu óhræddr. Eigi þorir hann heim at fara heldr. Nú gengr Bǫðvarr móti dýrinu; þat hœfir honum, at sverðit er fast í umgjǫrðinni, er hann vildi bregða því. Bǫðvarr eggjar nú fast sverðit ok þá bragðar í umgjǫrðinni, ok nú fær hann brugðit umgjǫrðinni svá at sverðit gengr ór slíðrunum, ok leggr þegar undir bœgi dýrsins ok svá fast at stóð í hjartanu, ok datt þá dýrit til jarðar dautt niðr. Eptir þat ferr hann þangat sem Hǫttr liggr. Bǫðvarr tekr upp ok berr þangat sem dýrit liggr dautt. Hǫttr skelfr ákaft. Bǫðvarr mælti: "Nú skaltu drekka blóð dýrsins."
Translation
Then Bothvar made his way to Hleithargarth. He came to the king's residence. Bothvar then led his horse to the stall near the king's best horses and asked no one about it; he then went into the hall, where there were a few men. He set himself at a distance, and when he had been there a little while, he heard some rummaging over in a certain spot in the corner. Bothvar looked there and saw that a man's hand was coming up out of a great pile of bones which was lying there; the hand was quite black. Bothvar went over and asked who was there in the bone pile. Then came a reply, rather timidly: 'I'm called Hott, dear sir.' 'Why are you here', said Bothvar, 'and what are you doing?' Hott said, 'I'm arranging protection for myself, dear sir.' Bothvar said, 'You're pitiful at protecting yourself!' Bothvar seized him and snatched him up out of the bone pile. Hott cried aloud and said, 'Now you'll kill me! Don't do that -- just before I was quite secure, but now you've thrown asunder my protection; and I had just made it so high about me that it had protected me against all your blows, so no strikes had landed on me for some time, though it was not so secure as I had intended it should be.' Bothvar said, 'You'll no longer have use of this protection.' Hott wept and said, 'Will you kill me now, dear sir?' Bothvar told him not to be so loud, then took him up and carried him out of the hall and to some water which was nearby -- few took notice of this -- and washed him all up.
Then Bothvar went back to the place he had taken up before, and led Hott behind him and set Hott next to himself. But he was so frightened that his limbs and joints shook, even though he seemed to understand that this man would help him. Soon evening came on and men entered the hall, and Hrolf's troop saw that Hott was set up on a bench, and it seemed to them that this man had become rather daring to have done so. Hott made an expression of contempt when he saw his acquaintances, since he had met ill at their hands. He was eager to leave and go back to his bone pile, but Bothvar held him so he couldn't get away, since he seemed less exposed to their blows as he was now than if he be allowed to go thither. The retainers now took up their usual custom, and cast forth small bones across the floor at Bothvar and Hott. Bothvar acts as if he doesn't notice it. Hott is so frightened that he takes neither food nor drink, and it seems to him time and again that he might get hit. And then Hott says to Bothvar: 'Dear sir, now a great knuckle-bone is coming at you, and it might mean to do us harm.' Bothvar told him to be quiet. He set out an open palm and received the knuckle-bone -- the leg-bone followed. Bothvar sent back the knuckle-bone and directed it at the one who threw it -- straight at him with so hard a blow that he caught his death. A great fear came over the retainers.
Now this news came to king Hrolf and his champions up in the castle, that an imposing man had arrived at the hall and had slain one of his retainers, and they wanted to be permitted to slay the man. King Hrolf asked in return whether the retainer had been slain without cause. 'Nearly so,' they said. Then the whole truth came out before king Hrolf. King Hrolf said it to be far from the case that they should kill the man -- 'You have taken up a bad habit here, to strike blameless men with bones; it is a disgrace for me, but a great shame for you, to do so. I have spoken often about that before, and you have paid it no heed, and I suspect this man, whom you have just attacked, might be no trifle compared to you. So summon him to me, so I might know who he is.'
Bothvar goes before the king and greets him with courtesy. The king asks him for his name. 'Your retainers call me Hott's-guard, but I'm named Bothvar.' The king said, 'What compensation will you give me for my retainer?' Bothvar said, 'He got what he deserved.' The king said, 'Will you become one of my men and take his place?' Bothvar said, 'I wouldn't refuse to be one of yours, but we shall not part as matters stand, Hott and I, but will both stay nearer you than that man had been sitting; otherwise we'll both be on our way.' The king said, 'I see no honor in him, but I would not deny him food.'
Bothvar now goes to the spot which pleases him, but he does not wish to occupy the one which that man had before. He snatches up three men in a certain spot and he and Hott set themselves down there farther in the hall than was designated for them. The men consider Bothvar difficult to deal with, and they hold great resentment toward him.
And as it came toward yule time, the men became depressed. Bothvar asks Hott what this all amounts to; he tells him that a certain animal had come there two winters in a row, big and terrible -- 'and it has wings on its back and it flies continuously. For two autumns now it has visited here and done great damage. No weapons cut it, nor do the king's champions come home, those who are greatest of all.' Bothvar said, 'The hall is not as well built as I had thought, if one animal will destroy the king's kingdom and property.' Hott said, 'That is no animal, but the greatest troll.'
It came to Christmas Eve. The king said, 'Now I want that my men be quiet and silent during the night, and I forbid all my men to go into certain danger against the animal, but the livestock fares according to whatever happens; I will not lose my men.' They all promise good behavior, to work according to what the king commanded.
Bothvar stole away during the night; he makes Hott go with him, and he does so unwillingly, and claimed it would be his death. Bothvar says that that might turn out better. They go away from the hall, and Bothvar ends up carrying him, so afraid is he. Suddenly they see the animal, and right then Hott cried out such as he could and said the animal would swallow him. Bothvar commanded this dog of his to be silent and cast him down upon the moss, and there he lay , not completely unafraid. Nor did he dare to go home. Then Bothvar goes to meet the animal; it happens that his sword is stuck fast in the scabbard as he wishes to draw it. Bothvar now tugs hard on the sword and shakes the scabbard, and now tries a sudden jerk of the scabbard so that the sword comes out of the sheath and he thrusts it quickly under the animal's shoulder so hard that it stuck in its heart, and the animal dropped down dead to the earth. After that he goes back where Hott is lying. Bothvar takes him up and carries him to where the animal lies dead. Hott shakes violently. Bothvar said: 'Now you shall drink the animal's blood.'
[N.B. Hott comes back from the escapade a changed man, with a renewed sense of confidence.]
Grammar
26 The Third Strong Conjugation
The third strong conjugation comprises verbs whose stem ends in two consonants, and whose present stem vowel is e or i. The ablaut series is as follows.

 	 	e, i -- a -- u, o, from Proto-Germanic e, i -- a -- u, o.
The typical present stem vowel is e, but this appears as i when immediately followed by n. Vowel alternation also shows itself in the past participle: the usual stem vowel is u, but this becomes o when it immediately precedes l or r. Several other sound changes occur frequently in verbs belonging to this class. The most important are listed below.

Stem-final ng > kk and nd > tt in past singular. Thus the common verb binda 'bind' has past singular forms ek batt, þú batzt (< *battst); likewise springa 'spring, jump' has past singular form sprakk.

Stem-final ld > lt in past singular. For example, gjalda 'pay' has past singular forms ek galt, þú galzt, hann galt; compare these to the plural forms vér guldum, þér gulduð, þeir guldu.

e > ja before l or r + consonant. This rule only applies to the infinitive and present plural forms of verbs whose stem ends in a consonant cluster beginning with l or r. In these situations, the stem vowel e diphthonizes to ja. For example, gjalda has the following present forms: ek geld, þú geldr, hann geldr; vér gjǫldum, þér gjaldið, þeir gjalda. Similarly hann bergr, but þér bjargið, from bjarga 'rescue'. No other forms show the diphthong, hence hann galt, þeir burgu, etc. The verb skjálfa 'shiver' retains a long vowel in the present plural and infinitive, e.g. vér skjálfum, but other forms parallel gjalda, e.g. ek skelf, ek skalf, vér skulfum, skolfinn.

v > zero before o or u. This rule is regular in ON, but is particularly important in reference to the principal parts of several Class III verbs. For example, verða 'become' has stems verð-, varð-, urð-, orð-. Compare the following forms: ek verð, vér verðum, ek varð, vér urðum, orðinn.

v-augment shifts a > ǫ, i > y, e > ø. Some verbs add a v-augment to the root-final consonants of the first and second principal parts. This augment causes u-umlaut of the root vowel when applicable. Consider the following forms of søkkva 'sink': stem sekkv- gives hann søkkr, þeir søkkva; stem sakkv- gives hann sǫkk; stem sukk- gives þeir sukku; sokkinn (irregular). Similarly, consider forms of syngva 'sing': singv- gives hann syngr, þeir syngva; stem sangv- gives hann sǫng (note ng does not become kk here); stem sung- gives þeir sungu; sunginn.

Some verbs show peculiarities other than those mentioned above. The verbs brenna 'burn' and renna 'run' show e rather than i in the present stem. The verb finna 'find' had an earlier stem *finþ-, which led to the stems finn-, fann-, fund-, fund- in ON. The verb bregða 'hasten', similar to verbs of Class II, has the past singular stem brá-: ek brá, þú brátt, hann brá; vér brugðum, þér brugðuð, þeir brugðu.

The verb springa 'shoot', with principal parts springa -- springr -- sprakk -- sprungu -- spryngi -- sprunginn, illustrates the conjugation. The active forms are as follows.

27 The Fourth Strong Conjugation
The fourth strong conjugation consists of a small group of verbs whose stem ends in a single resonant (l, r, m, n) and with present stem vowel e. The ablaut series is

 	 	e, i -- a -- á -- u, o, from Proto-Germanic e -- a -- ǣ -- u.
The past participle most often shows o as the stem vowel, less often u. For example, the verb bera 'carry' has principal parts bera -- berr -- bar -- báru -- bæri -- borinn; likewise stela 'steal' has principal parts stela -- stelr -- stal -- stálu -- stæli -- stolinn. The verb nema 'take' shows u in the fourth principal part: nema -- nemr -- nam -- námu -- næmi -- numinn.

The verb bera 'carry', with principal parts bera -- berr -- bar -- báru -- bæri -- borinn, illustrates the conjugation. The active forms are as follows.

28 Subject Agreement and Verbal Complements
The subject of a verb stands in the nominative case. Any adjective predicated to the subject also stands in the nominative, and agrees with the subject in gender and number. If the subject is of mixed gender, the adjective is neuter. Though complements to vera 'be' and verða 'become' are typically adjectives, sometimes adverbs are used in ON, particularly vel 'well' and illa 'badly'. For example, þat er vel 'it is good' (literally: 'it is well'); konungr segir at þat var illa at Arnljótr hafði eigi farit á hans fund 'the king says that it was bad(ly) that Arnljot had not gone to meet him.' On the other hand, ON often uses adjectives as complements where Modern English uses adverbs or adverbial phrases: varð Eyjólfr þá framarlega 'then Eyjolf (be)came frontward'; skulut þit brœðr fyrstir fara 'you two brothers shall go first'; Þrym drap hann fyrstan 'he killed Thrym first' (literally: 'he killed Thrym (the) first (one)').

Verb and subject generally agree in number, so that a singular subject has a singular verb, and a plural subject has a plural verb. When there is a compound subject, the verb often agrees in number with the nearest subject member only, even if this is singular. Adjectives may function in a similar fashion, agreeing in gender and number with the nearest referent. Consider the following example: var þá Ulfr ok allir stafnbúarnir komnir at lyptingunni 'then Ulf and all the forecastle men got to the poopdeck.' In this example var is singular by proximity to Ulfr, but komnir is plural by proximity to stafnbúarnir. The sentence konungr var allmjǫk drukkinn ok bæði þau 'the king was quite drunk, as was she' shows how a neuter adjective (bæði þau) is used to refer to a group containing different genders. Verb and subject may disagree in number if separated by several words: eptir þat dreif at þeim fóstbrœðrum vinir þeira ór Firðafylki 'after that their friends from Firthafylki rushed to the foster-brothers.' When a copula links subject and predicate, the verb often agrees in number with the predicate, e.g. váru þat lítil sár ok mǫrg literally 'that were small wounds and many.' A past participle often agrees with the verbal complement: var þat mikill fjǫlði orðinn 'it had become a great multitude.'

29 The Accusative Case
The accusative case is the case of the direct object. More generally, the case denotes extent in time or space, e.g. hann siglde dag ok nótt 'he sailed day and night'. Such uses of the accusative are particularly common with expressions of time: einn dag '(for) one day'; laugardag '(on) Sunday'; næstu nótt epter 'the next night'; annat sinn '(for) a second time'; aptan dags '(on) the day's evening'. Often when the substantive is not modified a preposition is used: í nótt 'that night'.

The -sk suffix of middle verbs often fills the role of the direct object (it in fact derives from sik, the accusative of the reflexive pronoun). Some middle verbs may nevertheless take a direct object, unrelated to the -sk suffix. For example, hann undraðisk þetta 'he wondered about that' (literally: 'he wondered himself that').

Many verbs take objects that are cognate with the verb, e.g. ráða ráð 'give counsel' (literally: 'to counsel counsel'); telja tǫlu 'tell a tale'. Intransitive verbs may take a substantive as direct object when the substantive's meaning reiterates or specifies the basic meaning of the verb. Typically such substantives are cognate with the verb itself: sofa svefn 'sleep a sleep'; hann fell fall mikit 'he fell a great fall.' Occasionally an adjective is used in this position, its referent coming from the verb itself: hann ríðr mikinn 'he rides hard' (literally: 'he rides a big (one), he rides a big (ride)'). Collectively such accusatives are termed internal accusatives.

In some situations ON employs a double accusative. There are three primary situations in which this occurs:

(1) Personal Object + Predicate: This usually denotes a change of state of the object. For example: ek settak þik mikinn mann 'I established you (as) a great man'; þann skal døma skógarmann 'one should reckon him a woodsman.'

(2) Personal Object + Internal Accusative: Examples are konungr hjó hann banahǫgg 'the king dealt him a deathblow'; dreymði (impersonal) hann (acc.) inn þriðja draum, literally 'it dreamed him the third dream.'

(3) Personal + Material Object: This generally occurs with impersonal verbs denoting lack or want. For example, skortir þik eigi metnoð 'you have no lack of pride' (literally: 'it lacks you no pride'); ef fǫður minn þrýtr drengskapinn 'if manliness ends for my father' (literally: 'if it ends my father manliness'); skall oss aldregi þá skǫmm henda 'this dishonor shall not touch us' (literally: 'it shall not hit us this dishonor').

The noun vegr 'way' is often used in the accusative to express manner. For example, heyrðu þeir lúðragang alla vega frá sér 'they heard the sound of horns around them in every direction'; hinn veg dreymði mik literally 'it dreamed me this (other) way'.

30 Pronouns, Adverbs, and Conjunctions Introducing Subordinate Clauses
The following pronouns and adverbs may introduce indirect questions.

Interrogative	 	Translation
 	 	 
hverr	 	who, which
hvat	 	what, what kind of
hvárr	 	which (of two)
 	 	 
hví	 	why
hvert	 	whither, to where
hvárt	 	whether, if
 	 	 
hvar	 	where
hvaðan	 	whence, from where
hvé	 	how
hversu	 	how
hvern-(v)eg	 	how
hvernog	 	how
 	 	 
nær	 	when
hvénær	 	when
 	 	 
These pronouns and adverbs are used for indirect questions, not for relative clauses. There are extremely rare instances in which hverr or hvat are used as relative pronouns, e.g. sé ek mann til, hverr bera skal øxina 'I am looking at the man who shall carry the axe', but this sort of use seems to be in imitation of Latin usage, and is confined to the Icelandic language.

Sometimes a separate deictic pronoun is used to point to the indirect question. This pronoun is typically þat, less frequently þetta or hitt. For example, þat vil ek vita, hvat þú vill veita oss 'I want to know this, (namely) what you will give us.' Most often this deictic is not present: hann spurði, hvaðan þat kvæmi 'he asked whence it came.'

The conjunction at 'that' often introduces indirect statements. Occasionally it is used with indirect questions, and in such circumstances it may follow the interrogative introducing the question. For example, Ólafr spurði Ǫnund, hvern styrk at hann myndi fá honum 'Olaf asked Onund (that) what assistance he might provide him.' The particle er which introduces relative clauses may be used in a similar fashion: þeir hǫfðu spurt, hvern mannskaða ok fjárskaða er hann hafði þar gǫrt 'they asked which crimes against man and property he had done there.' The particle er, in its generalizing use with interrogatives (e.g. hverr er 'whoever') may also be used in indirect questions: veiztu eigi, við hvern er þú átt um 'don't you know with whom you have to go at it?'

The primary subordinating conjunctions are given below.

áðr 'before'. áðr en 'earlier than' is also common in prose.

at 'that'. The range of use closely parallels the Modern English conjunction 'that'. It may be combined with other adverbs: svá at 'so that', introducing either a consecutive or modal clause; þó at, þótt 'although', introducing a concessive clause. at is used with comparatives, e.g. þú ert skauð at meiri, at þú getr eigi sótt tvá menn 'you are all the more chicken, that you do not go after two men.' It is also used with demonstratives. The demonstrative may stand for the clause as a whole: en þat vil ek ráða þér, at þú gefir eigi hringinn 'but this I will counsel you, that you do not give up the ring'. Some combinations are particularly common, such as til þess at 'so that'; því at 'because'; þess þó at 'yet so that'. See also Section 35.

ef 'if, whether, when (conditional)'.

en, an 'than, than that'. The use of en is often triggered by a comparative, e.g. þóat hann sé yngri, en í lǫgum es mælt 'though he be younger than is stated in the laws.' en is frequently used in conjunction with heldr 'rather': heldr en þú farir á brott, þá vil ek gefa þér... 'rather than you go on your way, I will give you...'.

es, er. This conjunction has no specific meaning, but is used as a general marker introducing a relative clause. Its uses are treated in Section 35.

meðan 'as long as, while'. meðan er is also common in prose.

nema 'if not, unless'.

ok 'and; as'. The sense '(the same) as' is used within a clause or to join two clauses. Compare the following two examples: svarar enn inu sama ok fyrr 'he gives the same answer as before'; þetta var samsumars, ok Steingerðr gekk frá Bersa 'that was the same summer as (when) Steingerth went from Bersa'.

sem 'like, as, as if'. This frequently correlates with svá 'so', e.g. eigi eruþ ér þó slikir, sem ér sýnezk 'you are not as you seem.' In the later language this begins to take the role of er as a general relative particle, perhaps beginning with constructions that could be interpreted in alternate ways: mun þat hér sannask, sem mælt er, at... 'that shall be here affirmed, as is said, that...' or 'that shall be here affirmed, which is said, that...'.

utan 'except'.

The year 1066 witnessed the great powerplay for control of England. England had been under the control of Edward the Confessor, but he was near death in 1065. The most important question was that of succession. Edward seems to have wanted to cede control to Duke William of Normandy, son of Duke Robert, who had received Edward during his exile under Canute the Great. In recent years, however, Harold, Earl of Wessex, had gained such power that he too might make a bid for the throne. Harold nevertheless undermined his position by taking an oath of loyalty to William when he was sent to the latter's court by Edward to bring confimation of William's succession. Also in the fray was King Harald Sighurtharson of Norway, a viking warrior also known as Harald Hardrada. He had served the Byzantine emperors as a mercenary and subsequently took the throne in Norway in 1047, constantly fighting with King Svein of Denmark for dominance in the region. Harald too had a claim to the throne of England based on a treaty in 1038-39 between Norway's King Magnus and the English Harthacnut. Finally, before his death on 5 January 1066, Edward chose to cede the throne to the strongest power in England, that of Harold. This led to the series of events related below.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is an important source for our knowledge of the events of 1066. The following is an excerpt from that year's entry.

1066 In this year King Harold came from York to Westminster during Easter, which occured after the midwinter in which the king had died. This Easter was on the 16th day of the kalends of May.

At that time round all of England were seen portents in heaven such as no man had seen before. Some said that what other men called the 'hairy' star was in fact a comet, and it first showed itself on the eve of the Greater Litany, that is the 8th of the kalends of May, and so shone all seven nights.

Immediately thereafter Earl Tostig came from overseas to Wight with as great a force as he could muster, and people there gave him supplies and provisions; then he left there and harried the coast wherever he was able, until he arrived at Sandwich. Then someone informed King Harold, who was in London, that his brother Tostig had come to Sandwich. And so he gathered great fleets and armies such as no king had ever assembled on land, since he had been assured that Earl William of Normandy, kin of King Edward, intended to arrive and overrun the land -- just as later would happen.

When Tostig found out that King Harold was near Sandwich, he departed Sandwich and took with him some of his shipmen -- some willingly, some unwillingly -- and turned north toward the Humber, and there harried Lindsey and killed many good men. When the earls Edwine and Morkere discovered this, they went there and drove them from the land. So he went to Scotland, and the king of the Scots protected him and and gave him provisions, and he remained there the entire summer.

Then King Harold came to Sandwich and awaited his troop, for it was quite a while before he could get it in place. And when the troop was finally collected, he travelled to Wight and stayed there for the whole summer and autumn; one could find land forces all beside the sea, though in the end it would be of no avail.

When it came to the Nativity of St. Mary, the men's supplies ran out, and no one could keep them there any longer. So he permitted the men to leave, and the king rode inland, and he drove the ships to London, though many died before they reached there.

When the ships reached home, King Harald of Norway went north to the Tyne unexpectedly with a fleet quite large and by no means small -- maybe three hundred ships or more -- and Earl Tostig met him with all that he had gathered, just as they had agreed before; and the two went with the entire troop along the Ouse up toward York.

Then someone informed King Harold in the south, when he stepped off the ship, that King Harald of Norway and Earl Tostig had come up near Sandwich. Then he travelled northward day and night as quickly as he could gather his force. Before the king could arrive there, the earls Edwine and Morkere gathered from their earldom as great a force as they could muster and fought with that army and pitched a fierce battle, and a great part of the English retinue was struck down or drowned or put to flight, and the Norwegians held sway over the battlefield. This battle fell on the eve of St. Matthew the Apostle, which was a Wednesday. And after that battle King Harald of Norway and Earl Tostig went to York with as great a force as seemed fitting to them, and they were given hostages from the town and supplied with provisions; and so from there they went to the fleet, and they agreed that, for complete peace, they all would go south with him and overtake the land.

Harold Godwinson swears an oath to William of Normandy
Historians frequently view the Battle of Stamford Bridge as a precursor to the Battle of Hastings, where William the Conquerer led the Normans to victory over an English army led by Harold Godwinson.  The Bayeux Tapestry contains a retelling of major events leading to the Battle of Hastings.  This scene depicts Harold’s formal surrender to William.  Image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.
Meanwhile Harold, king of the Angles, came with his retinue on Sunday to Tadcaster, and there arrayed his troop, and then went on Monday throughout York. But Harald, king of Norway, and Earl Tostig and their retinue had travelled by ship beyond York to Stamford Bridge, because they were promised with certainty that they would be brought hostages from throughout the shire. Then Harold, king of the Angles, came upon them unexpectedly across the bridge, and they clashed and were engulfed in bitter fighting through the day. There Harald, king of Norway, and Earl Tostig were killed and a countless number of men with them, both of the Norwegians and of the English. The Norwegians who were left were put to flight, and the English behind them struck violently until some reached the ships; some were drowned, some burned, and died in so many ways that there was little left. So the Angles held sway over the battlefield.

The king gave quarter to Olaf, son of the Norwegian king, and to their bishop and to the earl of Orkney, and to all those who remained on the ships. They went up to our king and swore oaths that they would always maintain peace and friendship toward this land, and the king let them depart with 24 ships.

These two battles were conducted within five nights.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following selection comes from Fagrskinna, so named because of the exceptionally beautiful binding of one of the manuscripts (subsequently lost due to fire). The work describes Norwegian history during the period from Halfdan the Black to 1177, and was written by an Icelander for King Hakon of Norway in roughly 1240. The story which follows is an excerpt from the account of the battle at Stamford Bridge, giving a more elaborate portrayal of the events on the battlefield just before the armies clashed.

The text is Norwegian and shows dialectal variation. Chief among these features are Old Norwegian æ where Old Icelandic has e, a lack of u-mutation in certain forms (e.g. takum and sannum), and alternate endings -ir and -it for the 2nd person plural -ið of Old Icelandic. It is common scribal practice to write the spirant g as gh.

On a literary level the passage is far different from its Anglo-Saxon counterpart. The author employs the simple and direct style of other sagas. The ON recension of the events at Stamford Bridge attempts more to craft a story, whereas the Old English Chronicle served merely to record events. The ON version is augmented by the dramatic relating of the dialogue of the main characters, which is capped by moments of poetic recital. The skaldic craft of poetic composition was extremely technical, often interlacing two separate statements in one. When this is done, it is the common practice of modern editors to help the reader by enclosing the words of one of the sentences within parentheses. This practice is followed in the second of the poems below, so that the words in parentheses, when taken together, form a sentence or clause grammatically distinct from the words outside the parentheses.

Translation
King Harald Sigurtharson rode on a black horse with a white blaze out before his troop and saw how the retinue was positioned, and he arranged them further forward, as he then wanted. And during this ride the horse fell beneath him, and the king from off it, and he said: 'A fall is a good sign for a journey.'
Then Harald, king of the Angles, spoke with the Norsemen who were with him: 'Do you know that noble man with the blue kirtle and impressive helmet, who launched himself off his horse?' They answered, 'We know him; that was the king of the Norsemen.' Then the king of the Angles said, 'He is a great and princely man, and it is likely that he has come to the end of his luck.'
Now 20 horsemen ride out before the host of the Norsemen and all are clad in mail. Then one horseman said, 'Where is earl Tosti -- is he in the troop or not?' He answered, 'It is not to be concealed that you might be able to find him here.' Then the horseman said, 'King Harald your brother would send you greetings and in addition to this, that you should have protection and the whole of Northumberland; and further he wishes, rather than you fight, to give you a third of his kingdom beside him.' The earl answered, 'Now there is a request for something other than the hostility and disgrace of last winter; but had that been sought before, then sound and with life would be many a man who now is not, and the kingdom of England might be none the worse for it. Now we have an alternative; but what would you now offer King Harald for his trouble?' Then the horseman answered, 'He said there something of how much of England he would grant him, he shall have a plot of 7 feet -- and longer by as much as he is taller than other men!' The earl responded, 'Go now and tell King Harald that he should ready himself for battle, since something else will prove true than that which the Norsemen said, that Earl Tosti would betray King Harald and part with him, he would fight at once, and increase the number of his enemies; but rather we all will now adopt a single purpose, to die with honor, or to take England in victory.'
The horsemen rode back. Then King Harald Sigurtharson said to the earl, 'Who was that eloquent man?' The earl answered, 'That was King Harald Gothvinason.' King Harald said, 'Too long was I ignorant of this. They came before our troop so that this Harald might not be permitted to pronounce our men's death-tidings.' 'That is true, lord', said the earl, 'the chief proceeded quite incautiously and that which you say might be true; we agree on this, but though he wanted to offer his brother peace and great power, I would certainly be called a worse leader rather if we should take the offer and I might have awaited such old age that I be my brother's killer; for it is better to accept death from your brother than to grant death to him.' 'That one was a small king,' said King Harald, 'and stood well in his stirrups.' Men say that King Harald recited this verse:
 	 	'We went forth in the ranks,
 	 	byrnie-less, with blue edges;
 	 	helmets shine, I have not mine;
 	 	my coat lies on the ship below.'
His byrnie was called Emma; it went all the way down to the middle of his leg, and was so strong that no weapon had any effect on it. Then King Harald said, 'That was poorly composed, so I shall now devise another better verse', and then recited this:
 	 	'We do not creep in battle,
 	 	before the clashing of weapons,
 	 	behind the curve of the shield --
 	 	so commanded the lady of the hawk's land, true of speech;
 	 	the lady bade me, where meet
 	 	skulls and the ice of battle,
 	 	long ago to carry on high
 	 	the helmet's seat into the clash of metal.'
Now the Angles give the Norsemen a charge and a harsh reception comes in return, and so the long spears were set and it hit hard against the horses.

The fifth strong conjugation comprises verbs whose stem ends in a single non-resonant consonant (i.e. a consonant other than l, r, m, n), and whose present stem vowel is e or i. The ablaut series is as follows.

 	 	e, i -- a -- á, from Proto-Germanic e -- a -- ǣ.
The typical present stem vowel is e, but some verbs have present stems which are followed by a j-augment. This has the effect of raising the stem vowel from e to i, which remains throughout the entire present system. The most common verbs of this type are biðja 'bid, ask', stem biðj-, and sitja 'sit', stem sitj-. Some examples of present forms are the following: ek bið, þú sitr, vér biðjum, þér sitið, þeir biðja. The remaining forms follow the normal pattern of the fifth conjugation: ek bað, þú sazt, v'er sátum, þér báðuð, beðinn, setinn.

The verbs liggja 'lie, recline' and þiggja 'accept, receive' have stems ending in a doubled consonant and a j-augment: liggj-, þiggj-. The augment does not appear in the past forms; the past stems ended in a single consonant, which disappeared in the singular forms by the time of the ON texts. The past plural forms are regular, retaining the single consonant. Consider the following forms:

present: ek ligg, hann þiggr, vér liggjum, þér þiggið;
past singular: ek lá, þú látt, hann þá;
past plural: vér lágum, þér láguð, þeir þágu;
past participle: leginn, þeginn.
The verb vega 'slay' (stem veg-) loses the final g of the stem in the past singular, with attendant vowel shift: hann veg, hann vá.

Some verbs show a complex treatment of v within the stem. The combinations (consonant + v + vowel) and (v + back vowel) show different results in the two verbs sofa 'sleep' (stem svef-) and vefa 'weave' (stem vef-). Consider the following forms of sofa:

present stem svef-: ek søf, hann søfr, vér sofum, þér sofið;
past singular stem svaf-: ek svaf, þú svaft;
past plural stem sváf-: vér sváfum, þér sváfuð;
past participle svef-: sofinn.
Compare these forms with those of vefa:

present stem vef-: ek vef, þú vefr, vér vefum;
past singular stem vaf-: ek óf, þú óft;
past plural stem vér ófum, þér ófuð;
past participle stem vef-: ofinn.
The verb troða 'tread' is irregular, showing o instead of e in the stems of the present forms and of the past participle. The past tense stems are regular. Consider the following forms:

present: ek trøð, þú trøðr, vér troðum, þér troðið;
past singular: ek trað, þú trazt;
past plural: vér tráðum, þér tráðuð;
past participle: troðinn.
The verb sjá 'see' belongs to this class, deriving from earlier *seh-. Various changes, however, have made the verb irregular. The present is built from the stems sé-, sjá-, the past singular from sá-, the past plural from sá-, and the past participle from sé-. The forms are as follows.

32 The Sixth Strong Conjugation
The sixth strong conjugation consists of verbs whose present stem vowel is a. The stem-final velar consonant (k, g) of some verbs causes fronting of a to e in the past participle. The ablaut series is

 	 	a -- ó -- a, e, from Proto-Germanic a -- ō -- a.
The present stem vowel a is always fronted in the present singular of Class VI verbs. Thus the verb fara 'go' has the following prinicipal parts: fara -- ferr -- fór -- fóru -- fœri -- farinn. Likewise taka 'take' has principal parts taka -- tekr -- tók -- tóku -- tœki -- tekinn. The verb draga 'drag' loses the stem-final g in the past singular, analogous to the verbs stíga (Class I) and fljúga (Class II): ek dró, þú drótt, hann dró.

The verb standa 'stand' loses the -n- outside of the present system. The d remains as ð, so that standa has the stems stand-, stóð-, stóð-, stað-.

The verbs sverja 'swear' (stem svarj-) and hefja 'heave' (stem hafj-) have present stems with a j-augment. This causes fronting of the root vowel in the present stem in both singular (common to all Class VI verbs) and plural. For example, ek sver, vér sverjum, þér sverið; ek hef, þú hefr, þér hefið, þeir hefja.

Verbs containing v before back round vowels lose the v in past singular and plural forms. For example, sverja above has forms ek sór, þú sort, vér sórum, þeir sóru; similarly, vaxa 'grow, wax' (present stem vax-) has past stem óx- in singular and plural, and vaða 'wade' (present stem vað-) has past stem óð- in singular and plural.

The verb slá 'strike, slay' had alternating stems slag-/slah-. Loss of -h led to a new present stem slá-. Other forms follow analogously to draga. The indicative forms are given below:

 	 	Present	 	Past	 	Participle
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stem	 	slá-	 	slah-	 	slag-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	slæ	 	sló	 	sleginn
2	 	slær	 	slótt	 	 
3	 	slær	 	sló	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	slám	 	slógum	 	 
2	 	sláið	 	slóguð	 	 
3	 	slá	 	slógu	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The verb hlæja 'laugh', which originally had a stem-final -g/-h and therefore conjugates similarly, is often listed with the seventh conjugation. Compare the following forms:

present hlæj-: ek hlæ, þú hlær, hann hlær, vér hlæjum, þér hlæið, þeir hlæja;
past singular hló-: ek hló, þú hlótt, hann hló;
past plural hlóg-: vér hlógum, þér hlóguð, þeir hlógu;
past participle hleg-: hleginn.
The verb deyja 'die', though a j-augmented verb similar to hlaupa of the seventh conjugation, nevertheless has forms similar to hlæja:

present deyj-: ek dey, þú deyr, hann deyr, vér deyjum, þér deyið, þeir deyja;
past singular dó-: ek dó, þú dótt, hann dó;
past plural dó-: vér dóum, þér dóuð, þeir dóu;
past participle dá-: dáinn.
The verb fara 'go', with principal parts fara -- ferr -- fór -- fóru -- fœri -- farinn, illustrates the typical conjugation of the Class VI verbs. The active forms are as follows.

33 The Genitive Case
The genitive case is the possessive case. This is truly a gross oversimplification; more abstractly, the genitive case denotes relationship of one sort or another. The relation may be possessive, as in Modern English 'the boy's bicycle'; but 'possession' is less appropriate for describing certain relations, e.g. 'the boy's love'. A noun in the genitive may be a logical subject of the noun on which the genitive depends: 'the boy's death'. By contrast, the noun in the genitive could be the logical object: 'Lincoln's assassination'. Suffice it to say, the range of use of the genitive case is quite broad, and its uses in ON are very often paralleled by its uses in Modern English.

The genitive is frequently used to refer to the whole, from which a part has been specified. This is typical with numbers: the decades are treated as nouns, and a genitive is used to specify what is being enumerated. For example, þrír tigir manna 'thirty menn', but literally 'three tens of men'. The usage is the same for a hundred and a thousand. The remaining cardinals, by contrast, are used adjectivally: tuttugu menn 'twenty men'; með fjóra ok þría tegu menn 'with thirty-four men'. The part may be indeterminate: fríðari an hverr maðr annarra 'sooner than all the others' (literally 'sooner than any man of the others'); þú hafir þá ekki dyrsins 'you have nothing of the animal'; snimma dags 'early in the morning'.

The genitive is used to specify characteristic or measure. For example, mikils háttar maðr 'a man of great import'; afreks verk 'a deed of heroism'; þess konar sending 'a message of this sort'; þriggja vetra bjǫrg 'sustenance for three winters (years)'. Typically in ON the material of which something consists is denoted by composition or a prepositional phrase using ór 'out of' or af 'from'. For example, gullker 'a gold vessel' or ker ór (af) gulli 'a vessel of gold'. The genitive may also be used as a complement to several adjectives: ker fult mjaðar 'a vessel full of mead'; einhvers verðr 'worthy of something'; einhvers fúss 'willing (to do) something'; einhvers búenn 'ready for something'; gróinn sára sinna 'healed of his wounds'.

The genitive has a usage with proper names which does not exactly parallel the similar usage in Modern English. Modern English statements like 'they gave him the name of Onund' (meaning 'they gave him the name "Onund"') have their exact counterpart in ON: gáfu honum Ǫnundar nafn. ON however extends such use of the genitive to situations where Modern English would simply use apposition: askr Yggdrasils 'the ash-tree Yggdrasil'.

The genitive may be used in an adverbial sense, independent of any other noun or phrase, to specify time or place. For example, fárra nátta 'within a few nights'; miðra garða 'in between the fences'; sama dags 'on the same day'; loks(ins) 'finally'; annars staðar 'otherwise'; þessa heims ok annars 'in this world and the next'.

Several verbs govern an object in the genitive rather than the accusative. For example, the verbs leita 'seek'; bíða 'await'; fá in the sense 'obtain a wife'; kenna 'sense'; minnask 'remember' all govern objects in the genitive. Some verbs relating to perception govern two objects, with a person in the accusative and a thing in the genitive. This parallels Modern English constructions of the sort 'ask someone (accusative) about something (genitive)'. Some such verbs in ON are spyrja 'ask'; bíðja 'beg'; eggja 'drive (someone to something)'; letja 'deter'. Other verbs govern a person in the dative and thing in the genitive. For example, hefna 'avenge': á ek at hefna honum mikillar sneypu 'I have a great injustice to avenge upon him.' Some verbs govern objects in the genitive only when used as present participles. For example, ráða einhverju 'to give counsel concerning something', but ert þú nǫkkurs ráðandi hér 'do you have something to advise here?'

34 The Dative Case
The basic function of the dative case is to denote the indirect object, or rather, the referent of an action. Such instances of the dative are usually akin to Modern English constructions using 'to' or 'for'. This basic usage is greatly expanded in ON, where the dative case has also taken on the roles ascribed to the Ablative, Locative, and Instrumental of other Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit. These correspond roughly to Modern English 'from', 'in', and 'with', respectively.

The dative is commonly used in conjunction with adjectives. The so-called dative of cause stems from an instrumental or ablative usage: fegenn einhverju 'pleased about something'. The dative of respect stems from an instrumental usage: fríðastr sýnum 'beautiful to behold'; betri kostum 'richer with opportunities'. With comparative adjectives, the dative has two basic uses, denoting the

point of comparison: the dative denotes the origin, or benchmark, of the comparison. For example, Tryggvi var hverjum manni meiri ok sterkari 'Tryggvi was bigger and stronger than any man'; hann fekk eigi mælt tveim orðum lengra samt 'he cannot put more than two words together'.
degree of difference: the dative denotes the degree to which the comparison holds. For example, lið miklu meira 'a much bigger troop' (literally 'a troop bigger by much'); viku fyrr 'a week earlier' (literally 'earlier by a week').
The dative also has several independent uses. The following uses stem from the Instrumental function:

dative of means or instrument: generally translated by 'with' or 'by means of'. For example, þá tók Hrólfr kraki høgri hendi gullit 'then Hrolf Pole-Ladder seized the gold with the right hand'.
dative of amount: for example, gjalde þat fullum gjǫldum 'he paid this with full retribution'; ríða fullom dagleiðum 'to ride a full day's journey'.
dative of attendant circumstances: fara hulðu hǫfði 'to go with head covered'; mæla hendingum 'to speak in rhymes'.
dative of accompaniment: sigldi Hrútr liði sínu suðr 'Hrut sailed south with his band.'
The dative may be used as a Locative to place something in space or time. For example, einu sinni 'once'; ǫllum misserum 'for all half-years, the whole year through'; stundum 'at times'.

In several Germanic languages, a handful of verbs take objects in the dative case. This class of verbs is quite extensive, by comparison, in ON. Several verbs in ON take dative objects where the corresponding verbs in other Germanic languages take an accusative. Some authors divide these verbs into four classes based on meaning:

'to be well-disposed to someone': e.g. bjarga 'protect', unna 'love'; similarly verbs with the opposite meaning, e.g. spilla 'destroy', bana 'kill', hafna 'abandon'.
'order, command': e.g. ráða 'advise', skipa 'array', stefna 'summon'.
'move quickly, transplant': e.g. bregða 'throw', drepa 'stab', snúa 'turn'.
'change one's mind': e.g. fagna 'rejoice at', heilsa 'welcome', hætta 'venture'.
The dative is also used with verbs of removing with the sense of an Ablative or Instrumental: ryðja land víkingum 'to rid the land of plunderers'; ræna mik lǫgum 'to rob me of (my) rights'.

The dative is often used in impersonal constructions with passive force. For example, honum varð litit upp 'it steered his gaze' (literally 'it was looked at for him'); varð þeim ok mart talat 'their conversation took itself in many directions' (literally 'it was for them also much recounted').

35 Subordinate Clauses with er and at
The two particles er and at are extremely common in Old Norse, each with a wide range of meaning. Some of their uses are discussed below.

The particle er, earlier es (and not to be confused with the third person singular present er, es < vera 'be'), is a general relative particle and has no meaning of its own. It serves only to mark its clause as relative, the particular connection with the main clause being determined solely from context. Because of this, er appears in a wide range of contexts and is translated (or not, as the case may be) in several ways, depending on whether or not it stands alone or in combination with other deictic or interrogative words. Its usage in ON parallels the use of ei in Gothic and þe in Old English.

er is used by itself to mark temporal clauses, substantival clauses, and conditional clauses. For example, bað hann koma til sín, er hann kvæmi aptr 'he told him to come to him(self) when he should return'. The clause may have concessive force: hann girnisk þess at halda Nóregs veldi undir sik, er engi Svía konungr hefir þat fyrr ágirnzk 'he strove to this end, to hold under himself power over Norway, though no king of the Swedes had previously accomplished that.'

er combines with some adverbs to yield a combined relative adverb. Some of the more common are the following:

temporal: þá er 'as, when'; þegar er 'as soon as'; nú er 'now when'; svá fremi er 'not until'; siðan er 'since'; unz 'until'; þar til er 'until'; nær(gi) er 'whenever'.
local: þar er 'where' (also conditional 'if' or causal 'considering that'); þangat er, þangat til er 'to the point where'; þaðan er 'from the point where'; hvar(gi) er 'wherever'; hvert(ki) er 'to wherever'; hvaðan er 'from wherever'.
modal: hvégi er, hversu er, hvernveg er 'however'.
er also combines with certain pronouns, with or without prepositions, to produce a relative adverb. The most notable are given below:

temporal: í því er 'at the moment when'; frá því er 'since'; epter þat er 'after'; um þat er 'until'; til þess er 'until'.
modal: at því er 'according as'.
causal: alz 'because'; við þat er 'considering that'.
In the later language er is found combined with the interrogative pronouns to produce relative pronouns, e.g. hverr er '(he) who, whoever'; hvárr er 'whoever (of two)'; hvat(ki) er 'whatever'; etc. This usage is an innovation in ON, imitative of Latin.

Old Norse has no specific relative pronoun, so that er is often employed to fill this role. More precisely, er signals the beginning of a relative clause which contains no relative pronoun, and so er may be construed as a relative in lieu of a more explicit pronoun. Interpreting er in this fashion, it may stand for a relative in any case required within the relative clause. For example, it may play the role of a pronoun in a case uniquely specified by the context, e.g. hann tekr hest, er Gunnarr átti 'he takes the horse which Gunnar owned'; or er may be construed as representing more than one case in combined relative clauses, e.g. þau áttu son, er Haraldr konungr jós vatni ok gaf nafn sitt 'they had a son, whom King Harald sprinkled with water and to whom he gave his own name.' er may be construed as representing a noun or pronoun not explicitly stated; in this sense, er introduces a clause which as a whole stands for the 'missing' grammatical element. For example, þá mæltu, er þar váru 'then spoke (those who) were there.' er may, in fact, stand for itself, in an absolute manner: er þeir rituðu, er þeim váru samtíða, er sǫgurnar eru frá '(the things) which they write, which are contemporary with them, from which the sagas stem.' er is nevertheless most frequently preceded by a demonstrative adjective or pronoun to which the relative clause correlates. This demonstrative however generally takes its case from its role in its own clause, and not from the relative clause. Consider the following examples: hvat fé er þat? -- Hér er fé þat, er Gunnarr greiddi mér 'What money is that? -- Here is the money which Gunnar paid me'; hann sendi hingat til lands prest þann es hét Þangbrandr 'he sent there to the land a priest who was called Thangbrand.'

The particle at 'that' is nearly as common as er, and parallels Modern English usage of 'that' as a subordinating conjunction. It commonly introduces substantival clauses, and less frequently result clauses: vera má, at gott sé verkit 'it could be, that the deed be good'; mun ek veita þér slíkt lið, sem þú will, at þetta fari framm 'I will give you such assistance as you desire, so that this may go forth.'

at combines with other adverbs which further restrict its sense. A few of the most common are listed below:

modal, consecutive: svá at 'so that'; til þess at 'so that'. For example, lǫgðu þeir á flótta, svá at fá ein skip váru eptir með jarls skipi 'they took to flight, so that only a few ships were left with the earl's ship'; skulu vér frændr þínir veita þér styrk, til þess at þú komir aldrigi síðan í slíkt ǫngþveiti 'we, your kinsmen, will give you assistance, so that you never again reach such straits.'
concessive: þó at, þótt 'although, if, whether'. For example, þó at hann deyi í mǫrgum syndum, þá lifir hann í trú sinni 'though he may die with many sins, he lives in his faith'. Sometimes þótt is closer in sense to Modern English 'that' or 'when': eigi gruna ek þat, þótt faðir þinn haldi lítt sáttirnar 'that I do not doubt, that your father would scarcely have reconciliation.'
causal: (fyrir) því at 'because'. For example, hrauð hann skipin skjótt, því at þar var borðamunr mikill 'he cleared the ships quickly, because there was a great difference of height'; kallar hann þat meirr verit hafa fyrir því játtat, at þeir váru þá komnir í greipr Óláfi konungi 'he says it was agreed more readily because they had fallen at that time into the clutches of King Olaf.'
The two particles er and at sometimes overlap in sense, so that either is possible. For example, er sá engi minn frændi, at gangi í þetta mál 'there is no kin of mine who would enter into such a deal.'

Viking Weaponry
The Viking Age warrior had a wide array of weaponry and protective gear available for use on the battlefield. In the earlier period sword and spear were the predominant weapons. The spear was later set aside in favor of the axe, and it is this weapon which frequently caught the imagination of artists depicting viking battles. Use of the sax was not unheard of, this being a short sword or long knife, and also of bow and arrow. For defense viking warriors often used a small, round shield. On the body they would wear a shirt of chain mail or corselet, though archaeological remains are scant, and it appears that most warriors could not afford such protection. In their stead, some warriors wore shirts of padded leather, or clothes with insewn bone plaques. Helmets were used, though the rarity of remains suggests that their use was far from widespread.

The sword more than any other weapon in viking culture was viewed with a certain amount of awe and reverence. A particularly good blade might bear a name and be passed down through generations as an heirloom. The creation of such blades was often given an air of mystery and magic. Swords typically weighed between four and five pounds, and were some thirty five inches from tip to butt. The blades were roughly five inches wide and thirty inches long. There was a small depression, the blood groove, a half inch wide and running down the middle of the blade. Some blades were damascened, i.e. made from alternating layers of iron and steel folded together, to produce a strong but flexible blade. Beginning in the tenth century one finds blades decorated with symbols, signs, or even texts. In the late eleventh century Christian symbols begin to appear.

The spear was an extremely common weapon in the Viking Age, and could be anywhere from six and a half to ten feet long, including an eight to twenty four inch metal point with socket tube. Spears fell into two broad types: those for casting, and those for thrusting. Some casting spears are said to have had ropes wrapped around them, so that as the rope unravelled in flight, the spear began to twist. The thrusting spears have longer, heavier heads. The socket itself was often longer to avoid being hacked off of the shaft. In later periods the socket tube of thrusting spears was often decorated in the same style as swords with intricate silver inlays.

Battle-axes came into use fairly late and were made with either wide or thin blades. In essence there were three types of axe. One type, the hand-axe, was little more than a farming tool. The light head carried a hammer opposite the blade, and this was fixed on a long iron-shod shaft. A second type, the bearded-axe, was commonly used in sea battles for grappling because of the squared projection at the bottom of the blade which gave it its name. The third type, the broad-axe, is the most famous. It is heavier than the other types, and the warrior grasped it with both hands. The blade could be up to twelve inches across, inlaid with silver or gold.

The Vikings used bow and arrow for both fighting and hunting. Bows do not survive from the Viking Age, but the sizes of arrows and depictions in art suggest the use of both a short bow and a long bow, which could be up to six and a half feet. The bows were typically made of pine. Arrowheads were generally iron. Sharp points were used to bring down big game such as reindeer, moose, and bear. Blunt arrowheads were used for the smaller game which was the mainstay of the fur-trade, the blunt point doing less damage to the pelt. Sometimes forked points were used for hunting birds.

The viking shield was round and formed of thin boards fixed from behind by an iron bar. The hand gripped the bar, and the knuckles protruded through a hole cut from the center of the boards. This hole, and thus the hand, was covered by an iron boss fixed to the front of the shield. A leather strap allowed one to hang the shield over the neck in order to keep both hands free. Leather might cover the face of the shield, and the rim might be ringed with iron. But generally little metal was applied to the shield, the preference being on lightness and ease of motion rather than on bulk and endurance. The shields were often painted a single bold color, and sparsely decorated, if at all. The more ornate shields were intended for show rather than for battle.

It appears that helmets of earlier periods were more ornate than their later counterparts. Some helmets dating to the late seventh century cover the entire head and face with guards for the neck and cheek. Ornamentation included eyebrow ridges and fine metalwork lining the rim. No helmets have been recovered with the stereotypical upward sweeping horns, though indirect evidence in the form of figurines and carvings suggest that some such helmets may have existed. These depictions, however, often seem to perform a magical role, and so if such helmets existed, they were presumably far from common. By the time of the Viking Age, helmet design favored a simple conical shape, sometimes with but often without a nosepiece. Helmets appear to have been fashioned from either metal or leather.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following selection is a poetical excerpt from Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks konungs. The diction of the poem is archaic, and some scholars have thought it to be the remnant of an earlier poetic form of the entire narrative, of which the saga we have is the distilled version. Some scholars of the early 20th century have included the poem with the collected poems of the Poetic Edda.

The poem begins when Hervǫr arrives on the island Samsey to claim the sword Tyrfing from her dead father Angantýr. The basic outline of the story up to this point is as follows. Dwarfs created the sword Tyrfing for Svafrlami, but one laid a curse upon it: that it should bring death to the one who wielded it, that no wound it caused should ever heal, and that it should bring about three shameful deeds. These are of course played out to the letter in the ensuing story. Arngrím killed Svafrlami and took the sword Tyrfing from him. Arngrím had twelve warrior sons, and one of them, Angantýr, received Tyrfing to carry to war. In Upsala, Angantýr made suit for the king's daughter, and the king ordered him to fight his champions Ǫrvar-Odd and Hjálmar on the isle Samsey. The king's champions arrived first on the island, heading inland and leaving their crew on the ship. When Angantýr and his brothers arrived, they killed the entire crew, but were sorely wearied from battle. Odd and Hjálmar arrived only after the brothers' fatigue had set in; Odd killed the eleven brothers, and Hjálmar killed Angantýr. Hjálmar nevertheless died shortly after Angantýr as a result of his wounds from Tyrfing. Angantýr's posthumous daughter, when she came of age to learn her father's true identity and the cause of his death, set herself on the track toward vengeance. She determined that Tyrfing was the proper instrument for her task, and so she travelled to Samsey and the burial mounds of Angantýr and his brothers to ask her father for the sword. This is where the poem picks up the story; from the end of the poem it is clear what Hervǫr's next task will be, as she puts revenge before her own well-being in true heroic tradition.

Hirðir kvað:

Hon sá nú haugaeldana ok haugbúa úti standa, ok gengr til hauganna ok hræðisk ekki; óð hon eldana sem reyk, þar til er hon kom at haugi berserkjanna. Þá kvað hon:

"Vaki, Angantýr! vekr þik Hervǫr,

Þá svarar Angantýr:

Þá var sem einn logi væri alt at líta um haugana, er opnir stóðu. Þá kvað Angantýr:

"Hnigin es helgrind, haugar opnask,

Translation
In Munarvag at sunset the young maid
met a man at his flock.
The herdsman said:
'Who has come alone to the island?
Go quickly to your lodging!'
Hervor said:
'I cannot go to my lodging,
since I know none of the island inhabitants;
before you go from here, tell
where are Hjorvarth's burial mounds?'
The herdsman said:
'Don't ask about that, you are not wise,
friend of vikings, you're in dire straits;
let us go as quickly as our feet will take us --
everything out here is harmful to men.'
Hervor said:
'We offer you treasure as payment for the information;
it is not easy to dissuade the friend of warriors;
no one has ornaments handsome enough to me,
rings so fair, that I not go.'
The herdsman said:
'Foolish he seems to me, who goes there,
a man totally alone, through dark night;
fire is in flight, the mounds lay open,
earth and bog are burning -- let us go quickly!'
Hervor said:
'Let us take care not to be frightened by such snorting,
though fires burn throughout the entire island!
Let's not allow dead warriors
to quickly frighten us; we shall make conversation.'
At that moment the herdsman was headed
to the woods at the words of this maiden;
but Hervor's heart, well-prepared
for such straits, swelled in her breast.
She then saw the grave fires and ghosts come out, and she went to the
mounds and was not frightened. She passed through the fires and smoke,
until she came to the mound of the berserkers. Then she said:
'Wake, Angantyr! Hervor wakes you,
sole daughter of you and Tofa.
Give out from the grave your sharp sword,
which dwarfs hammered out for Svafrlami.
Hervarth, Hjorvarth, Hrani, Angantyr!
I wake you all below the tree's roots,
with helmet and byrnie, with sharp sword,
with shield and harness, with reddened spear.
You, sons of Arngrim, violent kin,
have changed greatly for the heaping up of earth,
while none of the sons of Eyfura will
speak with me in Munarvag.
So be it for you all within your ribs,
as if you waste away in an ant hill,
unless you give the sword which Dvalin hammered;
it is not fitting for ghosts to hide the precious weapon.'
Then Angantyr answered:
'Hervor, my daughter, why do you call out so,
filled with curses? It works to your disadvantage.
You have become mad and senseless;
delirious, you wake dead men!
A father did not bury me, nor other kin.
They held Tyrfing, the two who lived,
though at last only one became the owner.'
She said:
'Tell it true: so the God should leave you
whole in the mound, if you do not have
Tyrfing with you! You are reluctant to give
the inheritance to your only child.'
Then it was as if a single flame was to be seen all around the graves,
which stood open. Then Angantyr said:
'The door to hell is open, graves lie open,
all the island's surface is seen to be on fire;
it is fearsome to behold all about.
Hasten, maiden, if you can, to your ships!"
She said:
"You could not light fires in the night,
so that I am frightened by your flames;
the maiden's thought-enclosure does not tremble,
though she see a ghost stand at the door."
Then Angantyr said:
"I tell you, Hervor, listen for the moment,
prince's daughter, to what will be;
This Tyrfing will, if you can believe,
maiden, destroy your entire family.
You will have a son who will later
carry Tyrfing and trust his might;
People will call him Heithrek,
he will be born most magnificent under the sun's pavilion."
She said:
"I lay a spell on dead men, so
that you shall all lie
dead with the ghosts, rotten in your grave;
Give, Angantyr, out from the grave
the dwarfs' work! It is not fitting for you to hide it."
He said:
"I declare you, young maiden, unlike to men,
as you go from the mounds in the night
with an inlaid spear and the Goths' metal,
with helmet and byrnie before the doors of the hall."
She said:
"I seemed man enough til the point
when I decided to seek your halls;
give up from your grave that which cuts mail,
that danger to shields, Hjalmar's bane!"
Angantyr said:
"Hjalmar's bane lies beneath my shoulders,
it is wrapped all about by fire;
nowhere on earth do I know a maiden
such as would dare take this sword in hand."
She said:
"I might care for and take in hand
the sharp sword, if I could have it;
I do not fear burning fire --
at once the flame sinks as I look upon it."
He said:
"You are foolish, Hervor, but possessed of courage,
as you rush wide-eyed into the fire;
instead I will give the sword from out of the grave,
young maid, I cannot refuse."
She said:
"Well you did, viking kin,
as you gave me the sword from the grave;
I seem now, prince, to be better off,
than if I should possess all of Norway."
He said:
"You do not understand -- you are hapless in your causes,
deceitful woman -- what the celebration will be for;
This Tyrfing will, if you can believe,
maiden, destroy your entire family."
She said:
"I will go to my ocean-steeds;
now the prince's maid is in good spirits;
little does that frighten me, princes' kin,
how my sons contend hereafter."
He said:
"You shall have and enjoy it for a long time,
keep Hjalmar's bane in the sheath,
do not touch the edges, poison is upon both;
it dispenses man's fate worse by disease.
Fare well, daughter! Readily would I give you
the life of twelve men, if you could believe,
the strength and endurance, everything good,
which Arngrim's sons left after them."
She said:
"Be you all -- the journey calls me --
safe in the grave! I must quickly hence.
Now most of all I seemed between worlds,
as fires burned around me."
Grammar
36 The Seventh Strong Conjugation
The seventh strong conjugation in ON comprises a handful of verbs which do not fit well in the other conjugations. There are traces of an ablaut series

 	 	a -- á -- ó from Proto-Germanic a -- ǣ -- ō,
for example glæa 'gleam' < *glāwjan vs. glóa 'glow' < *glōwan.

A number of roots in this class formed reduplicated preterites in the proto-language. That is, the preterite is formed by taking the initial consonant(s) and the vowel of the root, and attaching them to the front of the root (cf. OE hātan, 3 sg. past he-ht > hēt). Subsequent sound changes, however, tended to conceal the reduplication, and a new series of ablaut began to emerge. Other verbs followed the same ablaut pattern by analogy. By the time of the ON texts, five basic sequences have emerged:

Class VII	 	Infin.	 	Past Sg.	 	Past Pl.	 	Past Ptc.
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1. heita 'be called'	 	heita	 	hét	 	hétum	 	heitinn
2a. auka 'increase'	 	auka	 	jók	 	jókum	 	aukinn
2b. búa 'inhabit'	 	búa	 	bjó	 	bjuggum	 	búinn
3. falla 'fall'	 	falla	 	fell	 	fellum	 	fallinn
4. láta 'let'	 	láta	 	lét	 	létum	 	látinn
5. blóta 'offer'	 	blóta	 	blét	 	blétum	 	blótinn
The first and fourth principal parts of these verbs share the same stem vowel, as do the second and third principal parts (except 2b). Note the verb heita has two alternate stems in the present: heit- and heiti-; for example, ek heit or ek heiti, hann heitr or hann heitir.

The verb falla 'fall', with principal parts falla -- fellr -- fell -- fellu -- felli -- fallinn, illustrates the conjugation. The active forms are as follows.

Class VII	 	Indicative	 	Subjunctive	 	Imperative
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	fell	 	falla	 	 
2	 	fellr	 	fallir	 	fall

Past Ptc.	 	fallizk	 	 	 	 
Some verbs of the seventh conjugation do not fit into the above pattern, but are so common that they deserve mention. The verb ganga 'walk' has present stem gang-, but uses the stem geng- in all other forms. As seen in other verbs, in the past singular forms, stem-final ng > kk. The verb fá 'get; hand over' forms the past tense similarly, with stem feng- (ng > kk in the singular), but the present stem is fá-. The verb halda 'hold' follows the pattern of falla, with stem vowel a in the first and fourth principal parts, e in the second and third. In the past singular forms, final ld > lt. The verb hǫggva 'hew' follows the pattern of búa in the past singular and plural, but the present stem differs: haggv-. The indicative forms of these verbs are as follows.

Infinitive	 	ganga	 	fá	 	halda	 	hǫggva
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	geng	 	fæ	 	held	 	hegg
2	 	gengr	 	fær	 	heldr	 	heggr
3	 	gengr	 	fær	 	heldr	 	heggr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	gǫngum	 	fám	 	hǫldum	 	hǫggum
2	 	gangið	 	fáið	 	haldið	 	hǫggvið
3	 	ganga	 	fá	 	halda	 	hǫggva
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	gekk	 	fekk	 	helt	 	hjó
2	 	gekkt	 	fekkt	 	helzt	 	hjótt
3	 	gekk	 	fekk	 	helt	 	hjó
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	gengum	 	fengum	 	heldum	 	hjuggum
2	 	genguð	 	fenguð	 	helduð	 	hjugguð
3	 	gengu	 	fengu	 	heldu	 	hjuggu
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Past Ptc.	 	genginn	 	fenginn	 	haldinn	 	hǫggvinn
Three verbs still show remnants of reduplication: róa 'row', sá 'sow', and snúa 'turn'. The preterites show reduplication (e.g. reru), though the endings are those of the weak conjugation. The indicative forms are as follows.

Infinitive	 	róa	 	sá	 	snúa
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Present	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	rœ	 	sæ	 	sný
2	 	rœr	 	sær	 	snýr
3	 	rœr	 	sær	 	snýr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	ró(u)m	 	sám	 	snúm
2	 	róið	 	sáið	 	snúið

37 Weak Verbs and the First Weak Conjugation
37.1 Basic Formation of Weak Verbs
In contrast to strong verbs, which use ablaut, weak verbs employ a suffix -ði- to mark the past tense. This suffix is added to the verb stem, and to this the personal endings are appended. For example,

Stem	 	Past Marker	 	Person Marker	 	Resulting Form
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
sigl-i/j-	 	-ði-	 	-a	 	siglða 'I sailed'
kall-a-	 	-ði-	 	-r	 	kallaðir 'you called'
lif-i-	 	-ði-	 	-um	 	lifðum 'we lived'
When these elements combine, several sound changes may occur. The most important are the following.

i-deletion. The i of the suffix ði drops before a following vowel, e.g. kall-a- + -ði- + -a > kallaða. In addition, the thematic vowel i or the i/j-augment drops before the suffix ði, as a result of the general rule whereby unstressed vowels drop when followed by a single consonant plus vowel; for example, lif-i- + -ði- + -u > lifðu.

u-umlaut. When followed by u, unstressed a becomes u, and stressed a becomes ǫ. In many weak verbs this leads to a domino effect: kall-a- + -ði- + um > kalluðum > kǫlluðum; tal-i/j- + -ði- + -uð > talðuð > tǫlðuð.

-ð + ð- > -dd-. When stem-final ð comes into contact with the ð of the past tense suffix, both ðs become d; for example, eyða 'lay waste' (stem auð-i/j-) has past forms eydda 'I laid waste', eyddir, etc.

-n + ð- > -nd-. When stem-final n comes into contact with the ð of the past tense suffix, the ð becomes d; for example, munu 'will' has past mundi 'he would'. This change does not always occur, e.g. stefna 'set course' (stem stafn-i/j-) has stefnði 'he set course'.

-t, s + ð- > -tt, st. When stem-final t or s comes into contact with the ð of the past tense suffix, the ð becomes t. For example, flytja 'move' (stem flut-i/j-) has past flutta 'I moved'; sæta 'undergo' (stem sát-i/j-) has sætti 'he underwent'; þeysa 'gush forth' (stem þaus-i/j-) has þeysti 'he gushed forth'.

-p, k, f, l + ð- > -pt, kt, ft, lt. When stem-final p, k, f, or l comes into contact with the ð of the past tense suffix, the ð becomes t. This change does not always occur; for example, þurfa 'need' vs. þurfti 'he needed', but hafa 'have' vs. hafði 'he needed'; mæla 'speak' (stem mál-i/j-) vs. mælti 'he spoke', but vilja 'want' vs. vildi 'he wanted'.

-Cdd > -Cd and -Ctt > -Ct. Whenever the above rules produce the double consonants dd or tt, these are simplified to d or t if preceded by another consonant; for example, senda 'send' (stem send-i/j-) has past sendi 'he sent'; skipta 'shift' (stem skipt-i/j-) has past skipti 'he shifted'.

There are three basic classes of weak verbs. The first of these is discussed below.

37.2 The First Weak Conjugation
The first weak conjugation comprises verbs containing a thematic -i/j- suffixed to the root. The treatment of the thematic element varies depending on the length of the stem, and on the stem's final consonant. The notion of length, however, depends on one's method of description.

Recall (cf. Section 2.3) that there are two methods of syllabification, the traditional and the metrical. In the traditional scheme, syllables are divided so that non-initial syllables begin with a vowel. According to the traditional definition of syllable length, a short syllable is one which contains a short vowel, followed by no more than one consonant. A long syllable ends in a short vowel followed by a consonant group, or ends in a long vowel followed by no more than one consonant. An overlong syllable ends in a long vowel followed by a consonant group.

The metrical system divides syllables so that non-initial syllables begin with a consonant. A short syllable is one which ends in a short vowel, or in a long vowel followed by an unaccented vowel. A long syllable is one which ends in a long vowel, or in a short vowel followed by a consonant. We may also consider an overlong syllable to be one which ends in a long vowel plus consonant, or in a short vowel plus more than one consonant.

The rules of formation of the first weak conjugation -- i.e. the treatment of the thematic i/j -- will therefore depend on the description chosen. Most synchronic grammars of Old Norse follow the traditional system, while historical grammars often follow the metrical system (which happens to coincide with the nomenclature of grammars of other ancient Indo-European languages). Because each system has its merits, two formulations will be given below, one for each system.

Traditional Formulation

If the stem is short, the thematic element is -j-; if the stem is long or overlong, the thematic element is -i-. Consider the following examples:

Stem	 	Thematic	 	Infinitive
 	 	 	 	 
var-i/j- 'defend'	 	-j-	 	verja
sigl-i/j- 'sail'	 	-i-	 	sigla
skil-i/j- 'part'	 	-j-	 	skilja
stafn-i/j- 'head for'	 	-i-	 	stefna
sát-i/j- 'undergo'	 	-i-	 	sæta
Thus the stem skil- is traditionally short, and therefore takes -j- as the thematic element. By contrast, sát- is long, and so the thematic element is -i-.

Metrical Formulation

The thematic element becomes consonantal (j) or vocalic (i) so as to make the stem overlong if not already so. Consider again the same examples:

Stem	 	Thematic	 	Infinitive
 	 	 	 	 
var-i/j- 'defend'	 	-j-	 	verja
sigl-i/j- 'sail'	 	-i-	 	sigla
skil-i/j- 'part'	 	-j-	 	skilja
stafn-i/j- 'head for'	 	-i-	 	stefna
sát-i/j- 'undergo'	 	-i-	 	sæta
Thus skil- is metrically long, and takes -j- as the thematic element to make the stem overlong. By contrast, sát- is already overlong, and so the thematic element is -i-.

If we agree to use the term long, interpreted as 'overlong' in the metrical sense, and as 'long' or 'overlong' in the traditional sense, then the remaining patterns of the first weak conjugation may be stated concurrently. In this setting, short must be taken to mean 'not long'.

The thematic element occurs as part of the stem in both present and past forms of long-syllable stems. The thematic is only part of the present forms of short-syllable stems. The thematic element triggers i-umlaut in the root vowel, so that fronting occurs only in present forms of short-syllable stems, but in both present and past forms of long-syllable stems. Consider the following:

Underlying Stem	 	Present Stem	 	Past Stem
 	 	 	 	 
var-i/j-	 	ver-j-	 	var-
sigl-i/j-	 	sigl-i-	 	sigl-i-
skil-i/j-	 	skil-j-	 	skil-
stafn-i/j-	 	stefn-i-	 	stefn-i-
sát-i/j-	 	sæt-i-	 	sæt-i-
If a long stem ends in k or g, the thematic is usually -i-, but appears as j before a or u; for example, lág-i/j- 'lower' has 3rd sg. pres. lægir 'he lowers', but 3rd pl. pres. lægja 'they lower'. If a short stem ends in g (but not k), the thematic is absent in the past and normally j in the present, but appears as i in the present before a consonant or zero ending; for example, sag-i/j- 'say' has present stem seg-j- and past stem sag-. The 1st pl. pres. is segjum 'we say', 3rd pl. pres. segja 'they say', but 1st sg. pres. segi 'I say', 3rd sg. pres. segir 'he says'. Likewise þag-i/j- 'be silent' has 1st pl. pres. þegjum 'we are silent', but 1st sg. pres. þegi 'I am silent', 2nd/3rd sg. pres. þegir 'you are silent', 'he is silent'. Some short stems ending in g double the final g in the present; for example, lag-i/j- 'lay' has present stem legg-j- and past stem lag-. Thus the 1st sg. pres. form is legg 'I lay', 2nd/3rd sg. pres. leggr 'you lay', 'he lays'; it has past forms lagða 'I laid', lagði 'he laid', lǫgðum 'we laid'. Compare the following indicative forms of stems ending in g:

38 The Subjunctive
The subjunctive generally describes an event which is reported by the speaker as not actual. This may mean that the event is potential ('were I your brother...'), supposed ('assuming this be true...'), reported ('I've heard he would walk at night...'), desired ('Thy kingdom come...'), in contrast to actual ('I am your brother'), known ('It is true that...'), witnessed ('I saw that he walked...'), or realized ('as we forgive those who trespass...'). ON has two subjunctive formations, one built from the present stem of the verb, the other built from the past stem. The distinction, however, is not one of tense -- it cannot be, since the subjunctive denotes an event which is unreal, and therefore cannot be located in time. The distinction between Past and Present Subjunctive, then, is essentially one of the event viewed as a complete whole (Past Subjunctive) versus the event viewed as incomplete (Present Subjunctive), or rather, viewed without specific reference to its completion (though it may in fact be completed). The formation and use of the subjunctive in ON is described in the following sections.

38.1 Present Subjunctive
The endings of the present subjunctive are as follows.

 	 	Present Subj.
 	 	 
1 Sg.	 	-a
2	 	-ir
3	 	-i
 	 	 
1 Pl.	 	-im
2	 	-ið
3	 	-i
These forms are added to the present stem of verbs. Strong verbs exhibit no fronting of the stem vowel in the singular -- the stem vowel remains unchanged throughout the paradigm. Weak verbs, by contrast, show fronting only when there is a thematic -i/j following the stem. This fronting then occurs throughout the paradigm. Preterite-present verbs form the present subjunctive using the stem of the present plural. The verbs kalla 'call', telja 'count', and fœra 'bring' illustrate the present subjunctive of weak verbs. The verbs gefa 'give', taka 'take', hlaupa 'leap', and bjóða 'offer' illustrate the present subjunctive of strong verbs, while vita 'know' illustrates the paradigm for preterite-presents.

2	 	gefið	 	takið	 	hlaupið	 	bjóðið
3	 	gefi	 	taki	 	hlaupi	 	bjóði
The present subjunctive of the preterite-present verbs munu 'may' and skulu 'shall' alternately occur with fronted stem vowel, e.g. ek muna or ek myna, vér munim or vér mynim, ek skula or ek skyla, vér skulim or vér skylim.

The present subjunctive of vera 'be' is irregular:

vera	 	Singular	 	Plural
 	 	 	 	 
1	 	sé	 	sém
2	 	sér	 	séð
3	 	sé	 	sé
Some of the forms of the subjunctive of vera are the same as certain indicative forms of sjá, so that the possibility of formal confusion arises. Generally context makes the distinction clear.

The present subjunctive is often used in the following circumstances:

direct wishes, which are introduced by a form of vilja 'want' and the conjunction at; for example, vil ek at þú vitir þat..., literally 'I want that you know this...'.
conditions of negative import, usually introduced by þó at, þótt 'although, despite' a similar phrase; for example, þó at þú eigir þar gǫfga frændr... 'though you have noble kin there...'. Note, however, that simple conditions often use ef 'if' with the indicative, as in Modern English: ef þú hefir heilan hug... 'if you have sound intent...'.
assumption or indirect report, often introduced by ætla 'intend', vænta 'expect', lítask 'seem'; for example, ætlum vér at þú hafir gǫrt þetta við einræði þitt 'we hoped you would have done that at your own behest'; er þat ætlan min, at þessi kona kunni eigi at mæla 'this is my intent, that this woman should not know how to speak'.
potential or probable event, for example, veit ek eigi, hvar sú kona sitr, er mér sé mikit happ í at geta 'I don't know where that woman lies, whom it would be great luck for me to get.'
polite command, for example, várr herra launi yðr þann sóma 'might our lord pay you the honor'.
38.2 Past Subjunctive
The endings of the past subjunctive are the same as those of the present subjunctive. The difference in formation concerns the stem: the past subjunctive is formed from the past stem of weak and preterite-present verbs, and from the past plural stem of strong verbs. The stem vowel is fronted in all forms, singular and plural, when applicable. The verbs kalla 'call', telja 'count', and fœra 'bring' illustrate the past subjunctive of weak verbs. The verbs líta 'look', gefa 'give', fara 'go', hlaupa 'leap', and bjóða 'offer' illustrate the past subjunctive of strong verbs. munu 'shall', mega 'be able', kunna 'know how', and vita 'know' illustrate the paradigm for preterite-presents.

Verbs whose stem ends in a velar consonant (k or g) insert j before a following a or u; for example, taka 'take' has tækja, tækjum; draga 'drag' has drægja, drægjum. Note that the past subjunctive and past indicative forms of many weak verbs are the same; for example, kallaðir and fœrði may be either indicative or subjunctive, depending on context. The past subjunctive of vera 'be' is formed in a regular fashion from the past plural stem vár-:

vera	 	Singular	 	Plural
 	 	 	 	 
1	 	væra	 	værim
2	 	værir	 	værið
3	 	væri	 	væri
Uses of the past subjunctive parallel those of the present subjunctive. The past subjunctive is often used in the following circumstances:

indirect or polite wishes, for example, vilda ek at þú fýstisk eigi út til Íslands 'I would want that you were not eager to go out to Iceland'. In such constructions, vil ek has the connotation of 'I want', in contrast to vilda ek 'I (would) wish'.
past conditions of negative import, for example, aldregi drakk (hann) svá, at eigi segði hann sik þyrsta 'never did he drink such that he would not say he was thirsty.'
past assumption or indirect report, for example, Egill mælti, at þeir skyldi þá ekki drekka 'Egil said that they should drink nothing.' Note that when the main verb is in the present tense, an indirect statement is in the indicative: Egill segir, at þat var þá úvænt 'Egil says that that was unlikely.'
event potential or probable in reference to the past, for example, Egill fann þá, at honum myndi eigi við svá búit eira 'Egill then dicovered that he might not be able to tolerate this.'
indeterminate indirect question, in which the event under inquiry is not a specific fact; for example, Ásgerðr spurði, hv'art þau hefði máttverð etit 'Asgerth asked whether they had eaten supper'. By contrast, and indirect question concerning a factual event uses the indicative: þeir spurðu, hví hann var þar kominn 'they asked why he had come there.'
39 Reflexive and Middle Verbs
39.1 Reflexive Formation
The reflexive forms of verbs are formed simply by suffixing -sk to the usual form of the verb. This suffix -sk derives from the accusative of the reflexive pronoun sín. The only exception to this procedure occurs for the first person forms, in which the suffix is -mk, derived from the accusative singular of the first person pronoun ek. The suffix -mk is used for singular and -msk for plural forms. The plural form, however, frequently appears as -mk, rendering it in most instances indistinguishable from the singular. Note that the vowel preceding -mk is always u in the first person singular, indicative or subjunctive. The m of the suffix coalesces with the final m of the first person plural ending to give only one m: -m + -mk > -mk. The final -r of verb forms is lost before the reflexive suffix. The weak verbs verja 'defend' and kalla 'call', and the strong verb gefa 'give', serve to illustrate the reflexive paradigms.

39.2 Use of Reflexives
Derived from the reflexive pronoun, the -sk suffix still functions as a true reflexive in some instances; for example, hann varði sik and hann varðisk both mean 'he defended himself'. The full form of the reflexive pronoun and the suffix are not always interchangable, however, as in hann barði sik 'he struck himself' vs. hann barðisk 'he fought'. In its role as a true reflexive, there are three basic uses of the -sk suffix:

general reflexive: the -sk suffix is interchangable with the full form of the reflexive pronoun (sik, sér), often with verbs involving bodily motion; for example: lagðisk hon niðr í aðra rekkju 'she laid herself down on another bed'; hann settisk niðr 'he set himself down'; hann nefndisk Gilli 'he called himself Gilli'; Kjartan dvalðisk þar um hríð 'Kjartan settled himself there for a while'.
subject of subordinate clause: verbs of saying, thinking, perceiving, etc. employ a construction similar to the accusative-and-infinitive of Classical Greek and Latin. When the subject of the subordinate clause is the same as the subject of the head verb (the verb of saying), the verb of the subordinate clause is put in the infinitive and its subject (which is the same as the head verb's subject) is denoted by the accusative of the reflexive pronoun. This reflexive is often suffixed to the verb of saying as -sk; for example: hann kvazk fara skyldu vestr 'he said that he should travel west' (literally: 'he said himself to need to go west'); síðan hugðisk hann sofna 'then he thought he would sleep'; Skírnir lézk ganga mundu ok eigi fúss 'Skirnir conceded that he would go, but not willingly'.
reciprocal: when the reflexive refers to a plural, equivalent to the reciprocal hvár annan 'each other, one another', the reflexive appears as the suffix -sk; for example: þeir unnusk mikit fóstbrœðr 'the foster-brothers loved each other greatly'; skilðusk þá skipin 'then the ships separated from one another'; spyriask þeir tíðena 'they ask each other about the news'.
Another important use of the -sk suffix is the marking of the middle voice in Old Norse. To gain insight into the middle voice (compare Classical Greek and Latin), consider the verb 'soak' in Modern English. The sentences

 	 	'I soaked my shirt in detergent for an hour' and
 	 	'My shirt was soaked by me in detergent for an hour'
are logically equivalent (representing the same event), but display a difference in voice. The first sentence is active, in which the agent ('doer', or 'logical subject' -- here 'I') is also the grammatical subject. In this sentence, the patient ('receiver', or 'logical object' -- here 'my shirt') is the grammatical object. By contrast, in the second sentence 'My shirt was soaked by me...', the patient is the grammatical subject, and the agent is expressed by a circumlocution (a prepositional phrase). Now consider a third sentence:

 	 	'My shirt soaked in detergent for an hour.'
In this sentence, the agent-patient distinction breaks down. If we wish to force this sentence into the active-passive dichotomy, we may do so only with some effort. If we ascribe to the shirt authority in the soaking action, then we may say this sentence is equivalent to 'My shirt soaked itself in detergent...', and so the sentence may be viewed as active, but reflexive. If we do not allow the shirt to be the agent of its own soaking, then the sentence is equivalent to 'My shirt was soaked in detergent...', and so the sentence may be viewed as passive, but with no reference to the actual agent. Because of the nature of some verbs, it is better to admit a third category to the active-passive distinction. We call constructions of the type 'My shirt soaked in detergent...' illustrations of the middle voice.

Middle constructions are quite common in Old Norse and occur with a wide variety of verbs. This construction is common with verbs denoting 'seem', 'appear', or the like, usually in conjunction with a dative. For example: svá lizk oss, sem slíkum málum sé vel fellt at svara 'so it seems to us, that in such matters it would be suited to answer'; bað hann aðra menn hyggja at, hvárt (þeim) svá sýndisk 'he told the other men to consider whether it would thus seem fitting (for them)'. Verbs dealing with emotional or psychological states, or where the agent is otherwise indeterminate, use the -sk suffix. For example: allir undruðusk, þeir er sá hann 'all marvelled who saw him'; en þá es eyksk at váru tali it sjaunda hvert ár viku... 'but when for our reckoning each seventh year should be augmented by a week...'; fǫrunautar hans gerðusk þá úfœrir 'his travelling companions then became incapacitated'. Middle constructions often involve verbs whose meaning, such as 'turn, open, close, grow', etc., can be either transitive or intransitive in Modern English. The equivalent of the intransitive in ON usually takes the -sk suffix: hafði Gunnarr snúizk í hauginum 'Gunnar had turned to the mound'; haugar opnask 'the mounds are open'.

As is seen from some of the preceding examples, the use of reflexive forms may be difficult to distinguish from a true passive. Consider the following examples: skip búask 'ships are set up'; landit eyddisk af 'the land would be made desolate'; þá spurðusk þau tíðindi til Nóregs 'the reports were heard in Norway'.

The -sk suffix is not uncommon in impersonal constructions: sú er mér auðsæst úgipta Olafs, at honum glapðisk svá mjók sonaeignin 'this for me is Olafs most obvious misfortune, that so great a lack of progeny befell him'. A related construction occurs in poetry with forms ending in -umk, where -mk is equivalent to the dative form mér: sú erumk (= es mér) líkn 'that is a comfort to me'; stǫndumk (= stendr mér) til hjarta hjǫrr 'the sword sticks in my heart'. In Snorri's description of Skathi's marriage, one finds leið erumk (= eru mér) fjǫll..., ulfa þytr þóttumk (= þóttu mér) illr vesa 'the hills are hateful to me..., the cry of wolves seemed to me to be horrible'.

Often the -sk suffix has no obvious reflexive or middle connotation, but rather serves to change the meaning of the verb. Sometimes this occurs in conjunction with the addition of an adverbial, e.g. kanna 'search, explore', but kannask við 'recognize' in þá kannask margir við, ef heyra kenningarnafn mitt 'many recognize if they hear my nickname'. Sometimes there is no adverbial element to signal the change of meaning, e.g. láta 'let', but látask 'pass away, die', as in hversu margt hefir hér fyrirmanna látizk 'how many noble men have died here?' Often such uses may be seen as reflexive or middle when an older or less common shade of meaning of the suffixless verb is used. For example, if one glosses vega as 'smite', then vegask 'fight' in þat (sverð) var svá gott at sjálft vásk 'that (sword) was so good that it would fight by itself' is not a reflexive use. But if vega is glossed as 'lift', then vegask might be construed reflexively as 'lift oneself', and the preceding sentence should be translated as '... that the sword itself could lift/move itself'. Given context and the fact that it is a sword which is moving, the second translation still implies that the sword could fight by itself.

40 Tense and Aspect
40.1 Relative Time Marking
The subjunctive may be used to set events relative to one another. The conjunction áðr 'before' introduces clauses whose verb may be either subjunctive or indicative. When the subordinate verb is indicative, the events are simply related chronologically. For example: heldusk þeir eigi lengi við, áðr þeir váru yfirkomnir at mœði 'they did not hold out long before they were overcome with fatigue'; ok hvarf til hans, áðr Egill steig á bak 'and he embraced him before Egil climbed on back (of the horse)'. When the subordinate verb is subjunctive, the relation is more intentional than necessarily temporal, where the subordinate verb gives a purpose or reason. For example: vil ek, at t'u vitir þat, áðr vit sláim kaupi þessu 'I want you to know this, before we (should) strike this bargain'.

The auxiliary verb hafa is used to mark an event as anterior to another. The present formation is the perfect: sem Njáll hefir sagt 'as Njal has said'. The past formation is the pluperfect: hafði hann látit heita mungát 'he had let the ale brew'.

40.2 The Perfect
The verb hafa is used with the past participle to denote an event which is viewed as completed, but with relevance to the time-frame of the utterance or main verb. The nature of the perfect straddles the concepts of both tense and aspect. Early uses suggest that the perfect originally denoted a completed event. This use soon gave way to denoting a completed event with continuing relevance, and in this sense the ON perfect is not exactly equivalent to the perfective aspect, which denotes an event without reference to internal time structure. The perfect employs a conjugated form of hafa in conjunction with a form of the past participle. The past participle in early texts agrees in gender, case and number with the direct object of hafa, but this later gives way to the neuter accusative singular of the participle (the supine) regardless of the gender of the direct object. By the time of the classical ON period, the two constructions are in free variation, e.g. ek hefi kallat hann or ek hefi hann kallaðan 'I have called him'. The same distinction holds for the pluperfect, which employs past forms of hafa to denote an event anterior to another event in the past. For example: hann hafði sét hana or hann hafði hana séna 'he had seen her'.

Intransitive verbs of motion may form the perfect with vera as auxiliary. The participle in such constructions modifies the subject, and always agrees in gender, case and number. For example: hon er farin 'she has travelled'; Gunnarr var kominn at Hlíðarenda 'Gunnar had come to Slope's End'. The neuter nominative singular of the participle may be used in impersonal constructions, e.g. komit var at Hlíðarenda um kveldit 'it was come to Slope's End around evening'. One occasionally finds such intransitive verbs with hafa as auxiliary: Gunnarr hafði komit at Hlíðarenda fyrr um daginn 'Gunnar had come to Slope's End before daybreak'.

40.3 The Future
There is no morphological future in Old Norse. The present is often employed in a future sense. For example: þar liggr hann í bǫndum til ragnarøkkrs 'there he lies in bonds until the end of the world', where liggr 'lies' has the sense of 'lies now and will lie from this moment on'.

The future is also formed using modal auxiliaries in conjunction with a main verb in the infinitive. munu 'will' and skulu 'shall' are the most common modals. When the two are distinct, munu signifies inclination, while skulu denotes determination. For example: muntu m'er, Freya, fjaðrhams ljá 'will you, Freya, lend me your feather-dress?'; hann skal standa, þá er bæði himinn ok jǫrð hefir farizt 'he (the gods' residence) shall stand when both heaven and earth have perished'.

The modal munu does not always signify future meaning, but often connotes supposition akin to 'might'. For example: þú munt engis lofs þykkjask þurfa at biðja 'you might suppose yourself to need ask no permission'.

40.4 Historical Present
Old Norse makes frequent use of the historical present. This usage is common to Modern English, as typified by the opening line of many jokes: 'Two guys walk into a bar...'. In such situations, the present is used to refer to an action which occurred in the past. In rhetorical terms, the present is used to add vividness to the narrative, imparting a heightened sense of reality for the listener. The same is found in Classical Greek and Latin historical narratives. But the classical languages typically employ the historical present only in restricted contexts. Old Norse, by contrast, makes such extensive use of the historical present that it is likely much of the 'vividness' has been bleached out by the time of classical ON texts. A close examination of spoken Modern English finds similar usage occurs in informal conversation: 'I handed him the money, he gives me a stern look, and I walked away.' Though the historical present's use in ON narrative seems to be rather idiosyncratic, a few general tendencies may be observed. In passages where the historical present occurs, a past tense form must be used at the beginning. In extended passages, the historical present must alternate frequently with past tenses. Shifting between historical present and past tense rarely occurs in dialogue. Consider the following example, en Loki fór fyrir ok leggst niðr í milli steina tveggja; drógu þeir netit yfir hann 'but Loki went ahead and lies down between two stones; they drew the net over him'.

Lesson 9
Todd B. Krause and Jonathan Slocum

Aesir and Vanir
The gods are divided into two major races or lineages, the Aesir and the Vanir. Reckoned among the Aesir are those gods best known from tellings and retellings of Norse myths. Chief among the Aesir is Odin, a divine father in much the same sense as Zeus or Jupiter. He is the god of poetic inspiration, mystery, and magic. He is invoked by warriors as their patron. He is married to the goddess Frigg, who knows men's fates. The god Thor is counted first among the sons of Odin. He is a warrior god and married to Sif. Bragi is another son of Odin, and also linked to poetic speech. He is married to the goddess Idunn, who keeps the apples of eternal youth. Odin's son Baldr, husband of Nanna, was killed by the blind god Hod. Tyr is also Odin's son, a god of war who lost his hand to the wolf Fenrir. Heimdall is the herald of the final battle, which brings destruction to the gods. His nemesis, Loki, is a fickle creature, part god, part demon. Loki married Sigyn, but produced with the giantess Angrboda three notorious offspring: the wolf Fenrir, the World Serpent Jormungand, and Hel, ruler of the other world.

The Vanir appear to be on equal footing with the Aesir. One of the Vanir, Njord, is god of seafaring, fishing and wealth. He married the contrariminded giantess Skadi. Njord begat the twins Freyr and Freyja, who were also lovers. Freyr married the giantess Gerd, and Freyja married Od. Both Freyr and Freyja are gods of fertility and produce.

Occupying a status somewhat beneath these two races are a number of other lesser deities: Hoenir, Kvasir, Gefjon, Vali, Vili, Ve, and Vidar, among others. Several types of supernatural creatures appear in Old Norse literature: dwarfs, elves, norns, trolls, witches, valkyries. Chief among such creatures are the jǫtnar, a term usually translated as 'giants', but whose physical features are variable enough that the term only loosely applies. These 'giants' are the age-old rivals of the gods, and many stories tell of the conflict between the races.

Odin and Thor
Odin figures prominently in Norse mythology. The roles, however, in which he is found are so numerous and varied that any attemps to specify Odin as god of one or two specifc subjects or areas are generally impossible or impractical, and basically fundamentally misguided. A survey of some examples from Odin's host of epithets shows how fluid and changing Norse conceptions of the gods could be. Notable epithets are Alfǫðr (All-father), Valfǫðr (Father of the Slain), Hangaguð (God of the Hanged), Haptaguð (God of Captives), Farmaguð (God of Cargoes). These are but a small fraction of a much larger collection. A list found in Grímnismál includes Hnikarr (Inflamer), Bileygr (Weak-eyed), Báleygr (Fiery-eyed), Bǫlverkr (Evil-doer), Síðhǫttr (Long-hood), Sigfǫðr (Father of Victory), Blindi (the Blind One), Gǫndlir (the One with the Magic Staff), Jálkr (Gelding), Kjalarr (Feeder), Viðurr (Destroyer), Yggr (Terror), Váfuðr (Wind), Veratýr (God of Men). Each of these presumably captures some characteristic or mythological exploit ascribed to Odin, and shows the malleable nature of the Norse belief system. Another common epithet, Grímr (the Masked One), along with Síðhǫttr above, probably describes Odin's propensity for traveling in disguise. The appellation Hár is alternately translated as 'the High One' or 'the Blind One', depending on the etymology chosen. The references to blindness speak of the eye Odin gave in exchange for a drink from the wisdom-giving well Mimisbrunn.

Manuscript illustration of Odin
A illustration of Odin, principal god among the Aesir.  This depiction comes from the Icelandic manuscript 66 in the Safn Árna Magnússonar collection (SÁM 66), dating to c. 1765.  The image reproduces the page 77 recto as digitized on Handrit.is.
Lest the panoply of epithets leave the impression that Odin is pure enigma, a few of his more dominant characteristics may be pointed out. First and foremost, Odin is the patron of poets and kings, as well as warriors and those involved in magic. His patronage, however, is tinged with treachery and deceit. In some stories Odin will spur a faithful warrior to victory, only to see that he is cut down later to join Odin in Valhalla. His willingness to deceive is underscored by his use of disguises and false names, and his shape-changing ability. This underhandedness is countered by a constant devotion to knowledge, sacrificing himself on a tree for wisdom, and trading an eye for a draught from the well of knowledge. Odin questions the wise, makes the dead talk, and sends the ravens Hugin and Munin to all corners of the earth in search of news.

Thor, by contrast, is a straighforward warrior. He constantly battles the enemies of the gods. Thor carries three tokens of his warrior status: the hammer Mjollnir, a belt of strength, and iron gloves. Thor is unrivalled in strength among the gods. He is also renowned for his drinking prowess. Many of Thor's exploits center on his struggles with the jǫtnar, arch-rivals of the gods. He fought the giant Hrungnir, whose head and heart were stone. When Hrungnir threw his whetstone at Thor, he responed by casting Mjollnir, which split the whetstone in two. The hammer continued through and crushed Hrungnir's skull, killing him, but one piece of the whetstone struck Thor and lodged itself in his head. Thor also battled Jormungand, the World Serpent, a struggle which is depicted in many Viking Age carvings.

Curiously, Thor is the only god mentioned in memorial inscriptions. Sources say he commands the air, thunder and lightning, winds and rains, fair weather, and crops. He more than any other is taken as a personal god, and his name is found as part of many personal names: Þorsteinn, Þorfinnr, Þorgerðr, Þorgunnr. In a temple at Uppsala Thor's statue was placed between Odin and Freyr, signalling his prominence in that region over the other gods.

Baldr and Loki
Baldr and Loki have an intertwined history according to mythological tradition. Baldr is very much the pride of the gods, foremost in countenance, eloquence and grace. Little definite is known about him. Loki, by contrast, is a mischievous character, full of spite and an incessant troublemaker. Though his impetuous actions often get the gods into severe trouble, Loki's wit and cunning are just as often what save the gods from defeat.

Hermod travels to save Baldr
Hermod travels to secure Baldr’s release from Hel.  This depiction comes from the Icelandic manuscript 66 in the Safn Árna Magnússonar collection (SÁM 66), dating to c. 1765.  The image reproduces the page 75 recto as digitized on Handrit.is.
One story tells of a dream Baldr has presaging his death. When his dream becomes known to the other gods, this begins the causal paradox which leads to his ultimate demise. In the effort to save Baldr from misfortune, Frigg is enlisted to obtain oaths from all creatures that they should not harm Baldr. This done, the gods soon take to sporting with Baldr, hurling all sorts of weapons at him, confident they will have no effect. When Loki learns of the oaths, he disguises himself and asks Frigg if anything has yet to swear an oath. She replies that the mistletoe seemed too young to be asked. Loki then takes a shaft of mistletoe and tricks the blind god Hod to shoot it at his brother Baldr, who is promptly killed. The hero Hermod eventually rides to the other world, securing permission from Hel for Baldr to return from the dead, on one condition: that every creature weep for him. All creatures do this, save one hard-hearted giantess, presumably Loki in disguise. Eventually the angry gods capture Loki and chain him to rocks, with a snake dripping poison from above. Loki's destined escape will signal final doom for the gods.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The following is from the Vǫluspá 'Prophecy of the Seeress', first poem of the Poetic Edda as found in the Codex Regius. Though the manuscript dates from the 1270s, most scholars agree that the poem itself was composed some time in the late 900s. The poem is a cosmogony, though at times cryptic and vague. It begins at the behest of Odin (here called Valfǫðr), who asked the prophetess to tell of the beginning as far back as she can remember. She begins with the creation of the earth, then of time. The gods reside in peace until the arrival of three giantesses. Dwarfs are mentioned, then the creation of man, then the fates. A woman of magic comes to the gods and spurs a war between the Aesir and Vanir. When peace comes, a giant offers to rebuild Asgard in exchange for the sun, moon, and Freyja. The poem goes on at length, eventually turning to events of the future, including Ragnarok, the Doom of the Gods, at which time Baldr will return from the other world.

Translation
1 For audience I bid you all, hallowed beings,
great and small, kin of Heimdall;
you, Valfothr, desire that I well recount
the old tales of men, which I first remember.
2 I recall the giants, born long ago,
who had fed me ages prior;
nine regions I recall, nine giantesses,
the famous measure-tree beneath the soil.
3 It was early in time, when Ymir settled,
there was no sand nor sea nor cold waves;
no earth was to be found nor heavens above,
there was a chasm of void, still grass nowhere.
4 First the sons of Bur raised the earth,
the ones who shaped the great Midgard;
the sun shone from the south along the ground's stones,
then was the soil overgrown with green plants.
5 The sun, the moon's companion, cast from the south
its right hand round heaven's rim;
the sun knew not where she held lodging,
the stars knew not where they had dwellings,
the moon knew not what deal of strength he had.
6 Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement,
sacred gods, and deliberated on that:
to night and the moon's phases they gave names,
they named morning and midday,
afternoon and evening, to count out the years.
7 The Aesir met in Ithavale,
where they constructed high houses and sanctuary,
set hearths, forged treasures,
shaped tongs and fashioned tools.
8 They played tables on the stead, were merry,
they had no lack of anything golden,
until came three of the giants' maids,
quite powerful, from Giantland.
9 Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement,
sacred gods, and deliberated on that,
who should fashion the dwarfs' lord,
from Brimir's blood and from Blain's limbs.
10 There Motsognir became the greatest
of all the dwarfs, and Durin second;
they fashioned many a human form
from the earth, those dwarfs, as Durin said.
11 New-moon and Waned-moon, North and South,
East and West, Great-thief, Delayer,
Bivor, Bavor, Bombur, Nori,
An and Anar, Great-grandfather, Mead-wolf.
12 Liquor and Staff-elf, Wind-elf and Thrain,
Known and Thorin, Thror, Color and Wise,
Corpse and New-counsel -- now I have
-- Regin and Counsel-sharp -- rightly reckoned the dwarfs.
13 Fili, Kili, Foundling, Nali,
Haft, Vili, Hanar, Sviur,
Frar, Hornbori, Fraeg and Sea-pool,
Mudfield, Iari, Oakenshield.
14 It is time to tally the dwarfs in Dvalin's
line, the lineages in families up to Lofar,
those who sought from the hall's stone
the seats of muddy fields at Stonyvales.
15 There was Draupnir and Dolgthrasir,
Greyhair, Mound-river, Lee-plain, Glow,
Skirvir, Virvir, Skafith, Great-grandfather,
16 Elf and Yngvi, Oakenshield,
Fjalar and Frosty, Finn and Betrayer;
that reckoning, as long as mankind lives,
of Lofar's forefathers will be remembered.
17 Until three of that retinue came,
strong and benevolent gods, to the home;
they found on the land, with little strength,
fateless Ash and Embla.
18 Neither owned they breath, nor had they voice,
blood nor bent, nor good bearing;
Odin gave breath, Hoenir gave voice,
Lothur gave blood and good bearing.
19 I know an ash to stand, it's name Yggdrasil,
a high tree, watered with white-mud;
thence comes the dew, which falls in the dale,
green it stands ever over the well of fate.
20 Thence come three maids, knowing much,
from the sea which stands under the tree;
Fate they called one, Becoming the second
-- they scribbled on staves --, Shall the third;
they fixed the fates, they cut the course
for the ages' children, the destinies of warriors.
21 She remembers that fight first in the land,
when they studded Gullveig with spears
and in Grey-hair's hall burned her;
thrice they burned her, thrice reborn
again and again, though she still lives.
22 The called her Bright, where she came to houses,
right-speaking seeress, spirits she conjured;
she prophesied, wherever she could, crazed she prophesied,
ever was she the delight of a wicked wife.
23 Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement,
sacred gods, and deliberated on that,
whether the Aesir should pay tribute
or whether all the gods should receive offerings.
24 Odin let loose and shot among the people,
that was the first fight in the land;
broken was the board wall of the Aesir's barricade,
the death-proclaiming Vanir could tread the vale.
25 Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement,
sacred gods, and deliberated on that,
who had mixed all the air with misfortune
or given Od's maid to the giant's race.

42 Third Weak Conjugation
The third weak conjugation comprises verbs containing a thematic -i- suffixed to the root: lif-i- 'live', þor-i- 'dare', ná-i- 'reach'. The thematic -i- appears in all present forms, except when dropped before a following vowel. Note that the -i- does not cause fronting of the root vowel. Verbs ending in -á drop the thematic -i- in the 3rd person plural (only), as well as the 3rd person plural ending -a. The thematic -i- does not appear in the past forms. The indicative forms of ná-i- illustrate the peculiarities of roots ending in -á:

ná-i-	 	Present	 	Past

43 Preterite-Present Verbs
The term preterite-present refers to a small class of verbs whose 'present' forms take the endings of the strong preterite. That is to say, preterite-present verbs in prehistoric times formed a strong past tense which subsequently took on a present sense. The original present tense formations were lost. By the time of the Old Norse texts, these verbs form a new past tense based on the model of the weak verbs. Thus from a synchronic point of view, the ON preterite-presents form a present tense with the endings and ablaut of the strong past tense of other verbs, and form a past tense using the endings of the weak past.

This innovation in the past tense also extends to the infinitive of some verbs. The verbs munu 'will', skulu 'shall', and *knega 'know, be able' have past infinitives built with the weak dental suffix: mundu, skyldu, knáttu. As with their Modern English counterparts shall and can, these verbs are often used as modal auxiliaries. In particular, the past infinitives often occur in this role, presenting difficulties for rendering in Modern English, which does not have equivalent forms for these modal verbs. It is often expedient to re-render the basic meaning in English. For example, munu 'will' may be first thought of as 'be going to', so that mundu would then be equivalent to 'to have been going to'.

Because of their origin as strong pasts, the present forms of the preterite-presents fall into the same ablaut categories as the other strong verbs. The ablaut survives in the vocalic alternation between singular and plural forms in the present of these verbs. However no preterite-present shows the ablaut pattern of the second class, and by the time of the ON texts analogic changes have slightly shifted ablaut patterns so that no verb of the sixth class appears. The remaining exemplars of the various classes are given in the following sections.

43.1 The First Gradation
The first class of preterite-presents contains the verbs vita 'know' and eiga 'have, own'. Their principal parts are as follows:

The past participle of munu is not attested. The conjugations are given below.

Class IV	 	Present	 	 	 	 	 	Past

Participle	 	munandi	 	-	 	skulandi	 	munaðr	 	-	 	skyldr
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
One also finds subjunctive forms of munu 'will' without fronting, hence present subjunctive myna or muna, past subjunctive mynda or munda. Similarly, one finds present subjunctive forms of skulu 'shall' without fronting: skyla or skula. Under the influence of Norwegian, munu 'will' begins to display alternate present singular forms man, mant, man after the fourteenth century. Note the present plural forms munið and muna of muna 'remember'.

43.4 The Fifth Gradation
The fifth class of preterite-presents contains the verbs mega 'be able' and knáttu 'know, be able' (earlier knǫ́tto; the present infinitive *knega is unattested). Their principal parts are as follows:

Infin.	 	1st Sg. Pres.	 	1st Pl. Pres.	 	1st Sg. Past	 	Past Ptcple

The verb knáttu 'know (how to)' (cf. Old English cnāwan 'know') frequently appears in poetry, but not so in prose.

44 Anomalous Verbs: valda, vilja, vera
A few verbs do not fall easily into the conjugational patterns discussed so far, but are nevertheless so common that they deserve special mention. The verb valda 'cause; dominate' has present stem vald- and past participle stem valdin- and follows the formation of the seventh class verb halda. The past forms are built from the stem oll- in the singular, and from ull- in the plural, and they take the endings of a weak verb. In later ON literature analogical forms began to creep in, such as volla and volda in the past indicative, and vylda in the past subjunctive.

The verb vilja 'want' conjugates in the present according the pattern of short-stem, class I weak verbs (e.g. verja or telja), with the -r of the 2 and 3 sg. assimilating to the preceding -l. The 2 sg. ending -t is occasionally found, as with preterite-present verbs. The past tense follows the weak verbs. The past participle stem is vilja-, and there is a past infinitive vildu.

The most conspicuous anomalous verb is vera 'be', which in Old Norse is a suppletive system of two stems: *(e)s- in the present, *wes- in the past. Earlier forms showing -s- before it changed to -r- are common, particularly in poetry. The earlier forms of vera, ert, er, var, vart are respectively vesa, est, es, vas, vast. The later forms become dominant by roughly 1100. Forms of vera are often found in combination with the preceding word: nús < nú es 'now is', þaz < þat es 'that is', vér(r)óm < vér erum 'we are', þeir(r)ó < þeir ero 'they are', sælirró < sælir ero 'are blessed'. Note that forms of the present subjunctive of vera can be confused with present forms of sjá 'see' (cf. Section 31).

The forms of these three verbs are given below.

45 Word Derivation
45.1 Derived Verbs
Weak verbs with thematic vowel -a- are often derived from nominal or adjectival stems. For example, kalla 'to call' < kall 'a call'; sanna 'to prove' < sannr 'true'. A smaller fraction of these thematic-a verbs are derived from other verbal stems. These typically display an n-suffix, which in Old Norse has an inchoative sense. Consider the following examples.

Infinitive	 	Meaning	 	Stem	 	Derivative	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
sofa	 	'sleep'	 	svef-, sof-	 	sofna	 	'fall asleep'
vaka	 	'be awake'	 	vak-i-	 	vakna	 	'awaken' (intrans.)
þegja	 	'be silent'	 	þag-i/j-	 	þagna	 	'fall silent'
brjóta	 	'break' (trans.)	 	brot- (past ptc.)	 	brotna	 	'fall apart, break'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The n-suffix was not restricted to verbs derived from other verbs. Some are derived from adjectives, such as batna 'get better' from betri (< bat- + -ri).

Numerous i/j-thematic verbs are causatives derived from other strong verbs. Usually intransitive strong verbs are subject to this derivation, and the new verb is built to the stem which appears in the past singular of the strong verb. Consider the following examples.

Infinitive	 	Meaning	 	Stem	 	Derivative	 	Meaning	 	Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
sitja	 	'sit'	 	sitj-	 	setja	 	'set'	 	sat-i/j-
liggja	 	'lie'	 	lig(g)j-	 	leggja	 	'lay'	 	lag(g)-i/j-
skjalla	 	'clash'	 	skell-	 	skella	 	'cause to clash'	 	skall-i/j-
hlaupa	 	'leap'	 	hljóp-/hlaup-	 	hleypa	 	'make leap'	 	hlaup-i/j-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Semantic changes may over time obscure the causative relation between two verbs linked through this process. For example:

Infinitive	 	Meaning	 	Stem	 	Derivative	 	Meaning	 	Stem
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
hefja	 	'heave, raise'	 	hafj-	 	hœfa	 	'hit'	 	hóf-i/j-
fara	 	'go'	 	far-	 	fœra	 	'move, bring'	 	fór-i/j-
ríða	 	'ride'	 	ríð-	 	reiða	 	'carry on horseback'	 	reið-i/j-
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Some examples grouped according to conjugation class of the original strong verb are as follows.

Class	 	Infinitive	 	Meaning	 	Derivative	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
I	 	blíkja	 	'shine'	 	bleikja	 	'bleach'
 	 	ríða	 	'ride'	 	reiða	 	'let ride'
 	 	drífa	 	'drive'	 	dreifa	 	'disperse'
II	 	fljúga	 	'fly'	 	fleygja	 	'let fly'
 	 	brjóta	 	'break' (tr.)	 	breyta	 	'alter'
 	 	kjósa	 	'choose'	 	keyra	 	'spur'
III	 	drekka	 	'drink'	 	drekkja	 	'soak'
 	 	sleppa	 	'slip'	 	sleppa	 	'let slip'
 	 	brenna	 	'burn' (intr.)	 	brenna	 	'burn' (tr.)
IV	 	sofa	 	'sleep'	 	svefja	 	'calm'
V	 	sitja	 	'sit'	 	setja	 	'set'
 	 	liggja	 	'lie'	 	leggja	 	'lay'
VI	 	hlæja	 	'laugh'	 	hlœgja	 	'gladden'
 	 	fara	 	'go'	 	fœra	 	'bring'
VII	 	hlaupa	 	'leap'	 	hleypa	 	'make run'
 	 	búa	 	'reside'	 	byggva	 	'settle'
 	 	falla	 	'fall'	 	fella	 	'fell'
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
As with the thematic-a verbs, the verbs in i/j may be derived from adjectival or nominal stems. For example, nafn 'a name' > nefna (nafn-i/j-) 'to name'; kapp 'a contest' > keppa (kapp-i/j-) 'to compete'.

A few consonantal suffixes are used to derive verbs:

n: samna 'gather' (< saman 'together'), fagna 'please', brotna 'break';
l: hǫndla 'seize', sǫngla 'jingle';
g: nauðga 'compel', vingask 'become friendly', kvángask 'get married';
k: þurka 'desiccate'.
45.2 Derived Nouns and Adjectives
There is a wide array of derivational processes producing nouns and adjectives from verbs. Nouns and adjectives may correspond to any of the principal parts of a given strong verb. For example, to the strong verb rjóða 'make red' correspond the noun roði 'redness' and adjectives rauðr 'red' and rjóðr.

Suffixation is the most general means of derivation. Typically the addition of suffixes is accompanied by changes to the original stem. The stem vowel is fronted in nouns derived by the suffixation of -ð, -ing, and -ling. For example, hár (há-) 'high' > hæð 'height'; Hjarðarholt (holt-/hult-) 'Herd's Wood' > Hjarðhyltingr 'man from Herd's Wood'; Kaldbakr (bak-) 'Cold Back' > Kaldbeklingr 'man from Cold Back'.

Likewise adjectives derived by addition of -ð or zero show i-umlaut of the stem vowel. For example, auga (auga-) 'eye' > eygr, eygðr 'eyed'; hár (hár-) 'hair' > hærðr 'haired'; sund (sund-) 'swimming' > syndr 'able to swim'. Fronting also occurs with the suffix -sk, e.g. Ísland (land-) 'Iceland' > íslenzkr 'Icelandic', but this is not always the case (cf. danskr 'Danish'). The suffix -in often occurs with i-umlaut: happ 'luck' > heppinn 'lucky'. As expected, suffixes containing u generally lead to u-umlaut in the stem vowel: vǫldugr 'mighty' built to the stem vald-.

Several suffixes are commonly used to form adjectives:

ð: generally past participles of weak verbs, e.g. taliðr 'spoken', heyrðr 'heard', kallaðr 'called'. Note also the adjective dauðr 'dead'.
n: generally past participles of strong verbs, e.g. gefinn 'given', gripinn 'grasped', feginn 'gladdened', eiginn 'own'. Note also forn 'old'.
nd: present participles, e.g. gefandi 'giving'. Some original present participles have already been nominalized by the time of ON, e.g. bóndi 'farmer' (cf. búa 'have a household').

45.3 Compounds
Old Norse makes frequent use of compound words. For the most part compounds are built from two or three elements. The first element is commonly a noun, adjective, or preposition. The second element is usually noun, adjective, or verb. Compound nouns whose first element is in the genitive case are particularly common in ON. For example, vikustef 'week's notice', hellusteinn 'flat stone', handarkriki 'armpit', brúnamikill 'bushy-browed'. As such, these represent phrases frozen and treated as a unit in both form and sense. Other compounds contain an uninflected first element. Such compounds may be nouns, e.g. tanngarðr 'row of teeth', herklæði 'suit of armor', útibúr 'storehouse'; verbs, e.g. fyrirbjóða 'forbid', varðveita 'preserve', fulltingja 'support'; or adjectives, e.g. rauðskeggjaðr 'red-bearded', bláeygr 'blue-eyed'.

Compounds whose second element is a substantive often occur as exocentric (Skt. bahuvrīhi) adjectives. These adjectives modify another noun by describing some attribute of that noun. Examples in Modern English are blackbelt (i.e. 'one whose belt is black'), Blackbeard (i.e. 'the one whose beard is black'), one-eyed, highbrow, etc. Note these compounds do not describe the noun represented by the second element per se, but rather they describe someone or something related to an element of the compound (hence exocentric). For instance blackbelt does not refer to a belt, but rather to a person who possesses a belt of a certain kind. Examples in ON are bægifótr 'lame', ferfœtr 'four-footed', fagreygr 'fair-eyed', fámennr 'having few followers'.

The following are frequently found as the second element of compound adjectives.

gengr: e.g. arfgengr 'entitled to inherit', ógengr 'impassable'.
sæll: e.g. sigrsæll 'victorious'.
fœrr: e.g. þingfœrr 'able to go to a public assembly'.

Runes and Mystic Origins
It is commonplace nowadays to associate runes with things mystical and occult. There is a general sense that runes are imbued with a magical aura, that they are the conveyance of supernatural power and come from a divine or semi-divine origin. The question arises: how do we know this? what evidence is there for mystical runic associations? Even the most cursory investigation of runes and runic lore must endeavor to answer these questions.

Manuscript explanation of the runic alphabet
A manuscript page containing a representation and description of the initial characters of the runic alphabet.  This comes from the Icelandic manuscript 299 in the Handritasafn Kaupmannahafnardeildar Hins íslenska bókmenntafélags collection (ÍB 299 4to), dating to c. 1764.  The image reproduces the page 140 verso as digitized on Handrit.is.
The span of time during which runes were employed is actually quite large, beginning within a century or two of the Christian era, and continuing in one form or another for roughly the next thousand years. In search of an answer to the question of mystical origins, we must surely look at the earliest inscriptions. We must investigate the cryptic messages encoded in early uses and tease out the supernatural setting of their use.

A funny thing happens as we pursue this line of investigation. As we will see in the inscriptions at the end of this lesson, the earliest runic inscriptions are generally devoid of divine or mystical content. That is to say, the subject matter of the earliest inscriptions is mostly utilitarian. Statements like that on a wooden box from Garbølle are the norm: 'Hagirādaz made it'. Or even more simply on a clasp from Skåne, Sweden: 'I, Unwōdz'. These are not the cosmic pronouncements one would have hoped for, not the harbingers of hidden wisdom.

Where then did this mystical association arise? Much resides in various descriptions found in Old Norse literature. To take such data as truly representative of the origin and import of the runes, however, is folly. The Old Norse literature which comes down to us was written some 600-1000 years after the earliest runic inscriptions. The authors of these texts were as temporally remote from the earliest runic inscriptions as we are from the Old Norse descriptions themselves. Thus any depictions of the origin and nature of the runes taken from Old Norse literature must be regarded with some degree of suspicion.

Gallehus horns
Replicas of the Gallehus horns.  An inscription in runes adorns the upper rim of the horn at the top of the image.  The originals, found individually in 1639 and 1734 just meters from one another, were stolen and destroyed in 1802.  Reconstructions such as these derive in part from etchings made of the horns before the theft.  Image courtesy of Denmark’s National Museum, CC BY-SA.
Some scholars take this to mean that the use of runes is solely pragmatic, that is, strictly utilitarian. This is a rather extreme position, and misses the fact that there must be some motivation for writing on an object, even if the message itself is mundane. Consider one of the earliest inscriptions, the Øvre Stabu spearhead (c. 150-200 AD): raunijaz 'Prober'. Certainly both the person using the spear, as well as the person on the receiving end, were quite clear as to the nature of the instrument in question. Thus any sort of inscribed description could be nothing but superfluous. The writing itself must have contained some import in the mind of the inscriber. Whether this import was divine or not is difficult to say. Certainly not overly so. But it may have served to highlight the intended efficacy, perhaps in the way that one writes 'California or Bust' on a car with the tacit hope that the act of writing will somehow fix the intended outcome. In this sense the runes have a mystic power, but this is likely a culturally perceived power of writing itself, and not of the runes in particular.

Runes and Religion
It is also commonplace to hear that runes are a heathen, or non-Christian, writing system. As it turns out, none of the earliest inscriptions (from the 1st to 5th centuries AD) makes any mention of heathen gods. What is more, in later inscriptions, Christian content is quite common. In Uppland several stones are decorated with the cross and contain Christian prayers. On a stone from Risbye, one finds 'may God and God's mother help his spirit and soul, and grant him light and paradise'. One even finds runic inscriptions on churches themselves, on the doorways or bells or baptismal fonts. It seems clear then that the runes were in large part simply a useful and pragmatically employed writing system in the Germanic speaking areas.

The Runic Language
There are between 120 and 150 runic inscriptions dating from the earliest period (150-500 AD). The language of these texts is in many ways even more conservative than Gothic, in particular showing the retention of unaccented short vowels: -gastiz, cf. Goth. gasts, ON gestr. The early inscriptions are generally found in southern Scandinavia, particularly Denmark and Sweden. Though geographically in the heart of the Nordic speaking area, the antiquity of many of the linguistic features allows the language of the early inscriptions to be thought of as a parent to both the North and the West Germanic dialects. Important factors in this supposition are that Scandinavians did not dominate the Danish area until sometime in the 6th century, and that many natives of the Danish areas settled in the British Isles during the 5th and 6th centuries.

Reading and Textual Analysis
The verses below come from the Hávamál 'Sayings of the High One', second poem of the Poetic Edda as found in the Codex Regius. In modern culture this text might be labeled a 'book of proverbs', though it has a narrative thread binding it together, unlike a collection of proverbs. The poem is dictated in the first person, and the poet recalls lessons learned through the hardships of life. A constant theme is proper conduct, especially when one becomes a guest in another's home. Silence is tantamount to wisdom, and caution and common sense are touted as virtues. Countermanding the picture of drunken Vikings found in much of the sagas, here the poet continually rails againt overt drunkenness. Though admitting to his own over-drinking, he warns against it and emphasizes that the wise man always has his wits about him. Deep friendship earned through mutual giving and assistance is highly valued, and those who would deceive should be repaid in kind.

Noteworthy in verse 80 below is the mention of runes. Their origin is described as divine: the word used, reginkunnr 'of divine origin', is certainly old. We find it applied to runes in the inscription of the Noleby stone, discussed in Section 50 below.

Translation
1 All the gates,
before one goes forth,
he should spy about,
should peer round;
since it is difficult to know,
where enemies
sit forth on the bench.
2 Sound hosts!
a guest has come inside,
where shall he sit?
he is quite hasty
who shall in the firewood
test his luck.
3 There is need of fire
to him who has come in
and is frozen about the knees;
there is need to man
of food and clothes,
for the one who has travelled to the mountain.
4 There is need of water
to him who comes to the meal,
of a towel and of invitation,
of good disposition,
if he can get it for himself,
of conversation and of silence.
5 There is need of wit
to him who travels widely,
everything is easy at home;
he is suited for mockery,
he who knows nothing
and sits with wise men.
6 In his thought
a man should not be boastful,
rather wary in disposition;
when someone wise and silent
comes to the premises,
seldom does misfortune happen to the cautious;
since never obtains a man
a better friend
than a bit of common sense.
7 The wary guest,
who comes to a meal,
keeps silent with hearing tuned;
he listens with his ears,
and looks with his eyes;
thus every wise man informs himself.
8 This one is fortunate,
who gets for himself
praise and regard;
it is more difficult to deal with that,
which a man would have
in another's breast.
9 That one is fortunate,
who himself has
renown and wit, while he lives;
since ill counsels
has a man oft received
from another's breast.
10 A better burden
carries no man on his journey
than that it be a bit of common sense;
better than riches
that's found to be in an unknown land,
such is a poor man's means.
11 A better burden
carries no man on his journey
than that it be a bit of common sense;
he does not carry
worse provisions on the plain,
than that it be ale's over-drinking.
12 The ale of the sons of men
is not as good,
as they say;
since about his own mind
a man knows less,
the more he drinks.
13 That is called the heron of forgetfulness,
which hovers over ale-parties,
it robs a man of his mind;
with this bird's feathers
I was fettered
in Gunnlath's garden.
14 Drunk I became,
became overly drunk
at wise Fjalar's;
ale is best for this,
that each man
gets back his mind.
21 The herds know
when they should be at home
and then they go from the pasture;
but the unwise man
never knows
the measure of his stomach.
22 The man wretched
and badly off in character
laughs at everything;
he knows not that
which he needs to know,
that he is not free of faults.
23 The unwise man
lies awake all the nights
and worries about everything;
then he is tired,
when it comes to morning,
all his trouble is as it was.
24 The unwise man
thinks all those who laugh with him
to be his friends;
he does not seek,
though they concoct mischief for him,
whether he sits with wise men.
25 The unwise man
thinks all those who laugh with him
to be his friends;
then he discovers this,
when he comes to the assembly,
that he has few advocates.
46 Moreover this is concerning that one,
whom you hardly trust
and you have suspicion about his character:
you shall laugh with him
and speak contrary to your thoughts,
the returns shall be like unto the gifts.
47 I was young once,
I travelled totally alone,
then I went astray in my paths;
rich I seemed,
when I found another,
man is man's delight.
53 Of little sands,
of little seas
little are the minds of man;
for this all men
have not become equally wise,
half mankind is everywhere.
54 Moderately wise
should each man be,
never let him be too wise;
living is best
for those among men
who know much well.
70 Better it is for the living
and for those living happy,
ever the living gets the cow;
I saw the fire flame up
before a wealthy man,
and outside was death before the doors.
71 The lame man rides a horse,
the one-armed man drives a flock,
the deaf man fights and wins;
the blind man is better,
though he be burned:
no one benefits from a corpse.
72 A son is better,
though he be born late,
after the man is gone;
seldom do memorial stones
stand by the road,
unless kin should raise it for kin.
73 One's destroyers are two,
the tongue is the head's death,
in every coat for me
there's expectation of a hand.
79 The unwise man,
if he gets for himself
money or a woman's love,
his pride grows,
but never his sense,
he goes straight ahead to folly.
80 Then it is proven,
what you ask of the runes,
those of divine origin,
which the mighty powers fashioned
and the mighty sage colored,
then he holds best,
if he is silent.
Grammar
46 Runes
The earliest writings of the Germanic peoples are in runes. Far from being the polished literary documents of the Old Norse sagas, these writings are generally short inscriptions on various objects ascribing ownership, naming the maker, or marking a burial site. They do not name any historical figures, nor are they found on any objects whose history is known from other sources. Even when inscriptions are found, say, on stones near burial sites whose dates are well known, there is no conclusive evidence that the inscription dates from the same time period as the burial. The dates of the inscriptions, therefore, are generally educated estimates. What is more certain, generally, is relative chronology. Archaeological dating is often based on stylistic grounds, observing ornamentation and workmanship. Historical linguistics serves as an alternate, and sometimes more conclusive, method of establishing relative chronology.

Runic inscriptions are found over a wide expanse of the Germanic speaking area, dating from roughly the middle of the second century AD. The greatest number of inscriptions comes from the Scandinavian speaking area. Two alphabets are encountered, the Older and Younger Futharks. The Older Futhark was an alphabet of 24 characters used in the earliest inscriptions. In time there was a reduction in the alphabetic inventory, so that the Younger Futhark contains only 16 letters. Paradoxically, this seems to have occured at a time when the Scandinavian sound inventory underwent an increase!

The major dialect groups within Germanic during the time of the runic inscriptions are Northwest Germanic, East Gmc, West Gmc, North Gmc, West Nordic, East Nordic. The following chart shows the general timeline for dialectal differentiation:

 	 	100	 	200	 	300	 	400	 	500	 	600	 	700
NwGmc	 	[---	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	---]	 	 	 	 
EGmc	 	 	 	[---	 	 	 	---]	 	 	 	 	 	 
WGmc	 	 	 	[---	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	---]	 	 
NGmc	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[---	 	 	 	---]	 	 
WNord	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[---	 	---]
ENord	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	[---	 	---]
Northwest Germanic is sufficiently archaic to serve as the parent to West Germanic, as well as to the Scandinavian languages. North Germanic designates those linguistic features which are uniquely Scandinavian. The following sections will deal primarily with Northwest Germanic, because of its importance for understanding the earliest inscriptions.

46.1 Phonology
Proto-Germanic is the language stage intervening between Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and the Northwest Germanic language of the earliest runic inscriptions. Proto-Germanic (PGmc) may be thought of as a dialect of PIE which became so differentiated from other PIE dialects as to be treated as its own language. It serves as the parent for all of the Germanic languages. It inherited much of the structure of the parent PIE, but is characterized by certain divergences, particularly in the phonology. The vocalic system of Proto-Germanic may be reconstructed as follows.

PGmc	 	Simple	 	 	 	 	 	Long	 	 	 	Diphthong	 	 
 	 	Front	 	Mid	 	Back	 	Front	 	Back	 	 	 	 
High	 	/i/	 	 	 	/u/	 	/ī/	 	/ū/	 	 	 	 
Mid	 	/e/	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	/ei/	 	/eu/
Low	 	 	 	/a/	 	 	 	/ǣ/	 	/ɔ̄̄/	 	/ai/	 	/au/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The consonant system may be reconstructed as well. Its structure is as follows.

PGmc	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Palatal	 	Velar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stops	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
voiceless	 	/p/	 	/t/	 	 	 	/k/
voiced	 	/b/	 	/d/	 	 	 	/g/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Fricatives	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
voiceless	 	/f/	 	/þ/	 	 	 	/h/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasals	 	/m/	 	/n/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Affricates	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
voiceless	 	 	 	/s/	 	 	 	 
voiced	 	 	 	/z/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Apical Trill	 	 	 	/r/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Lateral	 	 	 	/l/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Glides	 	/w/	 	 	 	/j/	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Following the same geneological procedure, Northwest Germanic is similarly characterized by certain divergences from PGmc. The consonant system above is the same as that found in the earliest runic inscriptions. The vocalic system, however, is somewhat different. The following rules describe the changes that occured between PGmc and the appearance of the Northwest Germanic (NwGmc) dialect:

Rule 1: nonroot */ɔ̄̄/ > /ū/ finally and when followed by */i/;
Rule 2: nonroot */e/ > */i/ before final /z/;
Rule 3: nonroot */e/ > */i/ before */i,j/;
Rule 4: */i,e/ in third syllables is lost;
Rule 5: */j/ > */i/, */w/ > */u/ when final or before a consonant;
Rule 6: final */nz/ > */nn/;
Rule 7: final */n/ after nonroot syllable is lost;
Rule 8: final */d/ after nonroot syllable is lost;
Rule 9: medial */gw/ > */w/;
Rule 10: root */e/ > /i/ before */i,j/ or nasal+consonant;
Rule 11: root */ǣ/ > /ā/;
Rule 12: root */ɔ̄̄/ > */ō/;
Rule 13: nonroot */ai/ > */æ/, */au/ > */ɔ̄̄/, */ii/ > /ī/;
Rule 14: nonroot */æ/ > /ē/, */ɔ̄̄/ > */ō/;
Rule 15: root */u/ > /o/ before /a/ and former */ǣ, ɔ̄̄/;
Rule 16: root */ei/ > /ī/;
Rule 17: final */ɔ̄̄/ > /ū/.
With Rule 15, the newly emerging [o] becomes a true phoneme /o/. The resulting vowel system for NwGmc is as follows.

NwGmc	 	Simple	 	 	 	 	 	Long	 	 	 	 	 	Diphthong	 	 
 	 	Front	 	Mid	 	Back	 	Front	 	Mid	 	Back	 	 	 	 
High	 	/i/	 	 	 	/u/	 	/ī/	 	 	 	/ū/	 	 	 	/iu/
Mid	 	/e/	 	 	 	/o/	 	/ē/	 	 	 	/ō/	 	 	 	/eu/
Low	 	 	 	/a/	 	 	 	 	 	/ā/	 	 	 	/ai/	 	/au/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
North Germanic (NGmc) continues the same system. It is distinguished from NwGmc by the loss of medial */w/ before /ū/ and the loss of medial */h/ before /t/.

46.2 Orthography
The origin of the runic symbols themselves is enigmatic. Various scholars assign their provenance to Greek, Latin, or Etruscan alphabets of the period. Suffice it to say that none of the arguments is conclusive. Three inscriptions preserve the complete alphabet, and a handful of others preserve an incomplete version. The order of the runes is almost completely uniform between inscriptions. From Old Norse (as well as Old English) poetry much later we find that the names of the individual runes were remembered acrophonically, each being associated with a common word beginning with that letter (much like 'a is for apple, b is for boy'). The names are clear from the Old Norse Rune Poem, but since this poem is of a much later date, after several sound changes had occured and letters had been reanalyzed, the names should not be applied naively to the runes of the earliest inscriptions. Appropriate names for the early period have been proposed by Wolfgang Krause, and these are supplied in the chart below for reference.

Rune	 	Transliteration	 	Name	 	Meaning
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
ᚠ	 	f	 	fehu	 	cattle, possessions
ᚢ	 	u	 	urūz	 	aurochs
ᚦ	 	þ	 	þurisaz	 	ogre
ᚨ	 	a	 	ansuz	 	god
ᚱ	 	r	 	raidō	 	journey, wagon
ᚲ	 	k	 	kaunan	 	sickness
ᚷ	 	g	 	gebō	 	gift
ᚹ	 	w	 	wunjō	 	joy
ᚺ	 	h	 	haglaz	 	hail
ᚾ	 	n	 	naudiz	 	tribulation
ᛁ	 	i	 	īsaz	 	ice
ᛃ	 	j	 	jēran	 	(good) year
ᛇ	 	ǣ	 	īwaz	 	yew tree
ᛈ	 	p	 	perþō	 	fruit tree
ᛉ	 	z (R)	 	algiz	 	elk
ᛊ	 	s	 	sōwilō	 	sun
ᛏ	 	t	 	Tīwaz	 	(a god's name)
ᛒ	 	b	 	berkanan	 	birch twig
ᛖ	 	e	 	ehwaz	 	horse
ᛗ	 	m	 	mannaz	 	person
ᛚ	 	l	 	laukaz	 	leek
ᛜ	 	ng	 	Ingwaz	 	(fertility god's name)
ᛞ	 	d	 	dagaz	 	day
ᛟ	 	o	 	ōþalan	 	inherited property
 	 	 	 	 	 	 
The first six letters provide the name of the alphabet, Futhark.

The consonants provide a good match for the phonological system of Northwest Germanic. The consonant system appears thus:

NwGmc	 	Labial	 	Dental	 	Palatal	 	Velar
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Stops	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
voiceless	 	ᛈ /p/	 	ᛏ /t/	 	 	 	ᚲ /k/
voiced	 	ᛒ /b/	 	ᛞ /d/	 	 	 	ᚷ /g/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Fricatives	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
voiceless	 	ᚠ /f/	 	ᚦ /þ/	 	 	 	ᚺ /h/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Nasals	 	ᛗ /m/	 	ᚾ /n/	 	 	 	ᛜ [ng]
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Affricates	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
voiceless	 	 	 	ᛊ /s/	 	 	 	 
voiced	 	 	 	ᛉ /z/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Apical Trill	 	 	 	ᚱ /r/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Lateral	 	 	 	ᛚ /l/	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Glides	 	ᚹ /w/	 	 	 	ᛃ /j/	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
Note however the addition of ᛜ ng for [ng], which was not a distinct phoneme at the time, but rather an allophone of n before velars. The rune ᛉ z is often transcribed R. This highlights continuity with Old Norse, since by the time of ON the PGmc phoneme /z/ has rhotacized to /r/ in certain environments. Scholars often assume it passed through a stage where it was a voiced trill, akin to the r in the Czech name Dvorak. But it shows no alternation with ᚱ /r/ until the North Germanic period, and so for the earliest inscriptions it seems advisable to transcribe it with z.

If we similarly associate the vocalic runes with corresponding vowels in the phonemic system of NwGmc, we arrive at the following.

NwGmc	 	Simple	 	 	 	 	 	Long	 	 	 	 	 	Diphthong	 	 
 	 	Front	 	Mid	 	Back	 	Front	 	Mid	 	Back	 	 	 	 
High	 	ᛁ /i/	 	 	 	ᚢ /u/	 	ᛁ /ī/	 	 	 	ᚢ /ū/	 	 	 	ᛁᚢ /iu/
Mid	 	ᛖ /e/	 	 	 	ᛟ /o/	 	ᛖ /ē/	 	 	 	ᛟ /ō/	 	 	 	ᛖᚢ /eu/
Low	 	 	 	ᚨ /a/	 	 	 	 	 	ᚨ /ā/	 	 	 	ᚨᛁ /ai/	 	ᚨᚢ /au/
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
This again gives good agreement with the vocalic system of NwGmc if we assume (1) the long vowels were not orthographically distinguished from their short counterparts, and (2) the diphthongs were represented as digraphs composed of their respective elements. The only problem comes with the rune ᛇ ǣ, which in this system is superfluous.

Some scholars suggest that the rune ᛇ ǣ represents a vowel with a value between /e/ and /i/. This is possible, but posits an orthographic representation for a sound not thought to be phonemic in the system proposed above for the inscriptions. A cleaner resolution to the problem comes if we revise the list of proposed phonemes and make the following assignments:

Phoneme	 	*/a/	 	*/ō/	 	*/ǣ/	 	*/u, ū/	 	*/i, ī/	 	*/e/
Rune	 	ᚨ	 	ᛟ	 	ᛇ	 	ᚢ	 	ᛁ	 	ᛖ
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
In this system only /i/ and /u/ use common runes for the long and short variants. In the system of PGmc, these were the only phonemic long/short pairs. Thus this assignment follows the same assumptions (1) and (2) above, but removes the superfluous nature of the ᛇ ǣ rune. Under this interpretation, moreover, it is apparent that the development and use of runes actually occured in the Proto-Germanic period, before the advent of Northwest Germanic.

When the change PGmc */ǣ/ > /ā/ occured in root syllables, then ᚨ a was used to represent /ā/, in accordance with the runic use for u and i. Since the runes had been developed in the PGmc period, the shift PGmc */ai/ > */æ/ in unstressed position provided an alternate spelling ᚨᛁ ai for */ǣ/. Yet another spelling of */ǣ/ was ᛖ e. This arose from the shift of unstressed */ǣ/ > /ē/, and the use of ᛖ e to represent both long and short variants of /e/ in a similar fashion to /u/, /i/, and now /a/.

Similar variance arose in the use of runic ᛟ o. The development */au/ > */ɔ̄̄/ allowed ᚨᚢ au to alternate with ᛟ o. */ɔ̄̄/ subsequently became */ō/, now spelled ᛟ o. When a-umlaut of */u/ produced [o], then ᛟ o was used for this as well, akin to the usage of /u/, /i/, /a/, and /e/.

The runes ᛃ j and ᚨ a were acrophonically denoted jǣran (note the chart above writes jēran, since the spellings are based on the earlier proposal of a phoneme system lacking /ǣ/) and ansuz, respectively. With loss of initial PGmc */j/, ᛃ j became the āra-rune, and the acrophonic principle allowed this to alternate with ᚨ a in representing /ā, a/. In this setting, the āra-rune (formerly j) is transliterated A.

46.3 Orthographic Features
The above shifts in the phonemic system, and the resulting orthographic shifts, often lead to difficulty interpreting the runic inscriptions. In addition, other conventions were followed which further obscure the nature of the inscriptions. The following are the more important features found in the inscriptions.

F 1: NwGmc /ē/ is often spelled -ai.
F 2: Nasals are frequently not written before homorganic obstruents. This may either be omission of an expressed nasal, or convention for transcribing a nasalized vowel.
F 3: ng is not always used to represent /ng/.
F 4: Double consonants are often represented by a single graph, even across word boundaries.
F 5: After /s/ some voiced consonants are written with the unvoiced symbol.
F 6: An epenthetic vowel -- variously represented by a, e, or A -- often occurs between consecutive consonants.
F 7: Certain North Germanic inscriptions differentiate a and A, using a for a nasalized or epenthetic vowel.
F 8: A may continue its original /j/ value in noninitial position.
47 Runic Declension
Runic inscriptions are rare enough, and limited enough in scope, so as to make reconstruction of complete morphological paradigms difficult. The paradigms below list those forms which occur in the dialects under discussion, as well as their reconstructed antecedents.

47.1 Declension of Vocalic Stems
The inscriptions so far uncovered do not allow one to construct full nominal paradigms. From the material available, we may list the endings of the *o-, *yo-, *wo-stems as given below. The masculine declension has the following endings.

48 Runic Verbal Conjugation
As with nominal forms, only a small number of the possible verb forms actually occur in the extant inscriptions. In the present tense, only singular forms occur. In the past tense both singular and plural forms are attested, though not for the second person. The second person only exhibits singular imperative forms. In addition forms of both present and past participles are found. The forms of strong verbs, as well as those with irregular conjugation, are as follows.

Among the irregular verbs is 'be', with first singular form em. The present 1 sg. ending, when a vowel, is usually deleted when followed by the first person pronoun, e.g. hait-eka < haitē eka. The ENord 3 sg. ending -r is borrowed from the 2 sg.

49 Runic Syntax
There is still a great deal of debate concerning what exactly can be gleaned from the runic inscriptions concerning early Germanic syntax. Syntactic patterns, e.g. placement of certain types of words, obviously depends on the interpretation of given inscriptions, and often there is nothing approaching complete consensus. Nevertheless it is important to notice some general trends, however tentative their status may be.

49.1 Adjectives and Modifiers
Adjectives can precede or follow the noun they modify. The unmarked position appears to be before the noun. Preposed adjectives complete the sense of the noun, while postposed adjectives serve to make a contrast. The only example, however, of a preposed descriptive adjective is a predicate use: leubu mez |: wage: | birgnggu boro swestar minu 'Dear to me, (Wāgaz) Birgingū, (is) Borō, my sister' (Opedal stone). The adjective leubū is presumably descriptive ('she is my sister, and I of course love her'), not contrastive ('this sister I love, not the other one'). If it is true that postposed adjectives mark a contrast, then runo fahi raginakudo tojeka 'I prepare a suitable, divinely-descended rune' (Noleby stone) contrasts the rūnō in question with other runes. The adjective fahi 'suitable' clearly serves this function, and by implication these raginakundō runes are also contrasted with other, less-than-divine runes. (Note, however, that some scholars interpret fahi as 'I paint', and then there is no postposed adjective to speak of.)

There seems to be no correlation between strong/weak adjective endings and adjective placement: postposed adjectives may be strong or weak, and similarly for preposed adjectives. The strong adjective denotes a quality which is not a lasting attribute of the noun it modifies. With this interpretation, the postposed raginakundō suggests that divine authority was not a property of all runes.

Attributive genitives may precede or follow the noun they modify. For example, magoz minas staina 'my son's stone' (Vetteland stone), as opposed to þewaz godagas 'servant of Gōdagaz' (Valsfjord cliff). In general, the genitive precedes an inanimate noun, but follows an animate noun.

Pronominal modifiers generally follow the head noun. For example, magoz minas 'my son's' (Vetteland stone), swestar minu 'my sister' (Opedal stone). There is one example of a noun with demonstrative pronoun, which fits the same pattern: hali hino 'this flat-stone' (Strøm whetstone).

49.2 Verb Placement and Word Order
Verbs in the imperative are generally placed first: wate hali hino horna haha skaþi haþu ligi 'Wet this stone, horn! Scathe, scythe! Lie, that which is mown down!' (Strøm whetstone). A few inscriptions show other verb forms in initial position, one in second position, but the dominant pattern of the NwGmc inscriptions is for the verb to be in final position: ...dagastiz runo faihido '(I), ...-dagastiz, painted the rune' (Einang stone). The inscriptions of the most archaic period show a distinct tendency toward SOV word order, with VO in imperative statements.

In the North Germanic period, word order undergoes a shift. Most of the NGmc inscriptions show a medial position for the verb: ekA sigimArAz Afs[A]kA rAisidokA stAinA 'I, Sigimāraz, one found free of guilt, raised the stone' (Ellestad stone). The basic word order has become SVO.

Selected Annotated Bibliography
Todd B. Krause
Texts
Several of the grammars of Old Norse are actually readers, primarily, with a grammatical appendix. Below are a few useful resources. The bibliographies of these contain references to more scholarly text editions.

An Introduction to Old Norse, by E.V. Gordon; Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990 (repr.). This is still regarded as the standard reference, though often extremely daunting for self study. Texts are first, with grammar tucked somewhere at the end. The text selection is nevertheless fairly broad and engaging.

Edda. Die Lieder des Codex Regius nebst verwandten Denkmälern, ed. by Gustav Neckel and Hans Kuhn; Carl Winters Universitaetsverlag, 1968. Actually two volumes, the first containing the text of the Codex Regius, the second a complete glossary. The standard edition of the Poetic Edda. The glossary has been translated into English (see below).

Grammars
Below are a few grammars worthy of note. Most are out of print, and few are in English.

Altisländische und altnorwegische Grammatik, by Adolf Noreen; Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle, 1923. Still the standard grammatical reference for Old Norse grammar. Purely a reference grammar.

Altisländisches Elementarbuch, by Andreas Heusler; Carl Winters Universitätsbuchhandlung, Heidelberg, 1932. A concise grammar in logical form, not graded lessons. Places a large emphasis on historical sound changes, e.g. quoting verb paradigms with -er instead of the more common -ir, and nominal paradigms with -om instead of -um. Though not the current pedagogical trend, this is in fact quite useful as preparation for using Neckel & Kuhn's Edda, which retains manuscript readings. This grammar has short text selections and a glossary in the back. Its greatest feature, however, is a very detailed account of Old Norse syntax. The book is worth consulting for this feature alone.

Grammatik des Altisländischen: Mit Lesestücken und Glossar, by A. Zaluska-Stroemberg; Helmut Buske Verlag, Hamburg, 1982. A wonderfully written grammar, though in logical form rather than graded lessons. Very nice for the constant attention to matters of etymology. Contains a very broad spectrum of short text selections at the back, the first with translations (in German), the later ones without. Includes a glossary (ON to German).

Old Icelandic: an Introductory Course, by Sigrid Valfells and James Cathey; Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1982. The only grammar of Old Norse (restricted to Old Icelandic proper, though this is not much of a restriction) set out in a series of graded lessons. Extremely user-friendly, with a wealth of grammatical information. Now out-of-print.

A New Introduction to Old Norse, by Michael Barnes; Viking Society for Northern Research, 1999. This book, together with the Reader and Glossary by Anthony Faulkes (in separate volumes), serves as an excellent introduction to the language for the novice. Though not laid out in lessons like Valfells and Cathey, Barnes' book nevertheless proceeds gently to lead the beginner through the novelties of languages with a robust case-system and verbal morphology. A nice introduction for those with limited foreign-language experience.

Dictionaries
Two of the most useful dictionaries for those just beginning their study of Old Norse are the following:

A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic, by Geir T. Zoëga; Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1972. A smallish dictionary, but with ample vocabulary for all but the most obscure texts. Particularly useful are the charts in the back containing morphological paradigms and lists of irregular verbal and nominal forms. As with many of the most useful books in Old Norse studies, but most frustrating in the case of this one, the book is more often out of print than in.

Glossary to the Poetic Edda, by Beatrice La Farge and John Tucker; Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, Heidelberg, 1992. An incredibly useful translation of Kuhn's glossary. A wonderful gift to the study of the Poetic Edda.

Linguistic History
The following books study the relation of Scandinavian languages to the broader group of Germanic languages:

The Indo-European Languages: An Introduction to Their History, by Einar Haugen; Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1976. An authoritative study which has become a standard reference in the field.

Old English and its closest relatives: a survey of the earliest Germanic languages, by Orrin W. Robinson; Stanford University Press, 1992. An impressive book for the vast amount of material it covers in such a small space. Conversational in style and very engaging. This book is ideal for students wishing to get a jump-start into the field of Germanic historical linguistics.

History
A wonderfully readable account of Scandinavian customs and practices during the Viking Age may be found in the following:

Everyday Life in the Viking Age, by Jacqueline Simpson; Dorset Press, New York, 1967. A very readable outline of Viking Age society and culture.

Runes
There are several works on the language of the runes. The most recent standard on the language of the earliest inscriptions, and the obvious source for the lion's share of runic material in these lessons, is the following:

A Concise Grammar of the Older Runic Inscriptions, by Elmer H. Antonsen; Max Niemeyer Verlag, Tübingen, 1975. An absolutely exceptional work, laying out clearly the system of writing as well as the morphology and derivation of the language.
